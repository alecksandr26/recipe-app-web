Apple-Cranberry Crostada,"['          husband loved it ! ', ""           Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner. "", '           This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! ', '          Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning. ', '          I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make ', '          Didn\'t have much flavor to the ""filling"".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart. ']"
Apple Pie by Grandma Ople,"['          I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It‚Äôs a keeper! ', '          Go to recipe for all holidays!

Sarah's Homemade Applesauce,"['          Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples ', '          Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough. ', '          Yum good easy ', '          Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it! ', ""          I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too. "", ""          Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again. "", '          Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn‚Äôt made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again! ', ""          I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER! "", ""           Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much. ""]"
Apple Crisp,"['          Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum! ', '          It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water. ', '          I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it‚Äôs in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought ', ""           I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe! "", '          Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream! ', '          Very very good as is.  Used glass dish. ', '          the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!! ', '          Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious. ', '          Love it! ']"
Apple Pie Filling,"['          I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again. ', '          I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better. ', ""          5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great! "", '          Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect. ', ""          This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using. "", ""          no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half. "", '          Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies ', '          I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome ', '          Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my ""go to"" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp. ']"
Easy Apple Crisp with Oat Topping,"['          I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!! ', '          I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it. ', '          Made it in a 9x13"" pan (9"" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe. ', '          Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream. ', ""          I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!! "", '          easy to make and my friends all loved it!! ', '          Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect. ', '          My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-))) ', ""          Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious! ""]"
Easy Apple Cider,"['          Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving. ', ""           Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!! "", '          I don‚Äôt even like cider but this was AMAZING!!! ', '          I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self. ', '          You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good! ', ""          I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd "", '          Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange ', ""          This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good! "", ""          I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high. ""]"
Apple-Cranberry Crisp,"['          Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect. ', '          My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!! ', '          Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples) ', ""          Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out. "", '          Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.  ', '          Love, Love, Love! ', '          I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.

Old-Fashioned Apple Dumplings,"['          I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS! ', '          I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream! ', '          I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they‚Äôre in the oven now and I can‚Äôt wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I‚Äôve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G ', '          Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm. ', '          I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this ""apple rings"". ', '          Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough ', '          Smells amazing!! ', '           Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn‚Äôt used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!! ', '          Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty. ']"

Apple Turnovers,"['           These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.

', '           I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. ', '          Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples. ', ""          I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious! "", '          These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious! ', ""          Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group. "", '           I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don‚Äôt hold enough filling.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed . "", '           I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my ""appeal"" factor.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è ', '           Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i‚Äôm sure less butter would do the trick ', '          Carmel just slid off ', '          Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again. ', '          This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn‚Äôt have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed. ', '          The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have ""helpers"" in the kitchen, but I\'m so happy! ']"

This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup! ']"
Sauteed Apples,"['          Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish. ', '          I have used this for years as written.

This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream. ', ""          My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you "", '           FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider. "", '           This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect! ', ""          Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps! "", ""          Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again. ', '          Delicious.

Canned Apple Pie Filling,"['          Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.

German Apple Cake,"['          This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples. "", '          I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch. "", '          I would use less nutmeg ', ""          This recipe did not turn out well for me.

I'll look for another baked apple recipe.

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too. ']"
Waldorf Salad,"[""          My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.

I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color.

When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.

Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples.

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice.

Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed . "", '           I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.

The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i‚Äôm sure less butter would do the trick ', '          Carmel just slid off ', '          Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again. ', '          This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn‚Äôt have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed. ', '          The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have ""helpers"" in the kitchen, but I\'m so happy! ']"

Again, thank you "", '           FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps! "", ""          Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

Canned Apple Pie Filling,"['          Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.

That was a good idea. ', '           This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in! "", ""           I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it. "", '          Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.

They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe! ']"

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color.

It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.

Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples.

I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

That was a good idea. ', '           This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.

Debbie's Amazing Apple Bread,"[""          This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.

I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.

Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in! "", ""           I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it. "", '          Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf. ', '          This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe! ']"

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

Since the apple sauce was hot, I folded it in after I mixed the wet and dry ingredients and folded in the cubed apples afterwards. A few other adjustments I made (but weren't necessary! just felt like doing it) was sprinkled some pumpkin spice blend (I'd say about 1/4 tsp) into the dry mix and I used two cut up apples for the fresh apples at the end - mainly because I wanted to get rid of them all before everything started to rot ;) Thank you so much to the maker of this recipe!

Apple Oatmeal Crisp,"['          This was good, but a little dry.  I made a syrup using butter brown sugar an a little white sugar, and added some cinnamon.  Mad it in microwave.

Veronica's Apple Pancakes,"['          I made these this morning and they were fantastic! Easy fast recipe. Pancakes fluffed up nicely. Just the right amount of apple flavor and not too sweet.

Plus, the pancakes even looked as good as they tasted. ', '          I altered this recipe based on the prior reviews I doubled the cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white.

Great for gifts: put dry goods in a jelly jar and put an apple on top with a bow.  Will make again!! ', ""          the first time i made these, last autumn, i thought they were pretty bland - but i had a cold and figured it was from that.  Made them again today and they were still bland.  They need some salt and some more cinnamon and maybe some other spices -allspice, nutmeg, ginger...  We made some apple compote to have with them and that made them pop.  They're quite dense and filling - we did not eat anywhere near as many as we thought we would. ""]"
Spiced Applesauce Bread,"[""          I think this is a very flexible recipe.

Baked Apple Roses,"[""           Came out perfectly! Baked at 375 for 40 minutes with foil on top the entire time. Really helped to keep the color and prevent the apples from browning.

Someone suggested using melted vanilla ice cream so I told that route.  Oh My...it was diViNe! ', '          This recipe has potential but MUCH too sweet the way it is! Even my kids said so! It could have done with 1/2 c brown sugar in the bread and apple mixture. I made it with leftover brioche which was very nice. Baked for 45 min, perfect consistency.  I used half the amount of sugar for the sauce and 1/4 cup heavy cream + 1/4 cup milk which added a richness to the sauce!  Will try it again but with half the amount of sugar next time. ']"

Instant Pot Meatloaf,"[""          I love allrecipes! I typically read through reviews and adjust the recipe hear and there. This recipe had very few recommendations so I stuck pretty close.  I used panko because it's what I had and added about 1-2 TBS fresh chopped parsley because it needed to be used.  Doubled the sauce.  I used a bundt pan (with 1 C water in pot) instead of loaf shape in foil. Cooked for 25 minutes and NR.

Easy Apple Coleslaw,"['          I made this for Easter today.

First, the recipe calls for an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings. It appears by most photos that everyone used a larger can by how many pineapple rings are on their cakes.  I could not find an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings so purchased a Dole 20 oz. can (in heavy syrup) and measured out what would be 8 oz. which turned out to be 4 pineapple rings and about 1/3 cup of juice. (That kinda makes no sense because now I needed 2/3 cup of milk and she calls for 1/4 cup or as needed - this seems like a big leap but that's ok - I did use 2/3 cup of milk to bring that to 1 cup). I did decide to use another couple of pineapple rings from the  can because it looked too sparse just using 4 which didn't seem to make any difference in the end anyway. Secondly, the recipe calls for an 18.25 oz boxed yellow cake mix.  What I found was 15.25 oz. Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. Could this be the reason why so many cakes are coming up with too much moisture?  Maybe. Thirdly, like many others at 40 minutes a wooden skewer showed that my cake was still not baked through.  I left it another 10 minutes (a total of 50 minutes) and then it was done perfectly.  Making those changes though - made an absolutely terrific Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt¬Æ Cake! Couldn't give it the 5 stars I wanted to for all of the diversions I had to make to the original recipe buts it was 5 stars after my changes.  I hope that helps some others!

', '          A couple of notes about this recipe; first the baking time is off, most bundt cakes need at least an hour of bake time. Second, I think the amount of butter for the topping needs to be reduced, maybe 1/4 cup would work better as this is not being baked in the traditional cast iron or 9x13 pan. I dried my pineapple and cherries before putting them in the pan. Hope this helps. I will definitely make it again, it‚Äôs delicious and look beautiful. ', ""          Beautiful and delicious!

Thirty Day Friendship Cake,"[""          I use 6 foil loaf pans to bake then and I  use toothpick method, about 50 mins. that way you can put them in ziplock bags for freezer after they cool in their pans.

Remove from bag (if you want) and at that time of year you can usually find decorative plastic bags to put it in as a gift. Make sure you use a plastic that has good closures.

Old Time Mincemeat Pie,"[""           I did make it... Followed the posted recipe as closely as possible. Unable to find currants, I used a mix of dried dates and dried cranberries as a substitute. Not sure why the recipe calls for reserving the liquid from the sour cherries (then never has it used).Turned out pretty good. Wasn't too difficult. The recipe made enough for two pies. I baked one pie and froze the rest of the mix for another pie. "", '           This is a great pie to make, but it takes planning.    A bit of advice for the next baker, for the round steak, ask the butcher to grind it up like hamburger (run through grinder 3 times).  This will save you a huge step and eliminate the chopping after cooking the meat.  I also recommend making your own candied citrus peel.  This is another step in advance that can take 2-3 days for the peel to dry, but well worth it.  I used a combination of grapefruit, lemons, limes and oranges.  There are many recipes on-line and best way to peel the fruit is to use a kitchen potatoe peeler to take the peel off the fruit, otherwise it is a challenge, now that I did it the other way.  Enjoy! ', '          I have never had real mincemeat pie before so I wanted to try this, and am very glad I did.  The taste was so much better than the stuff in the jar.  I would recommend serving it warm with whipped cream on top. ', '          I have a questions about this pie before making/rating it; hopefully, someone knows the answer.  The recipe says to make the mincemeat several weeks in advance and a couple reviewers said they did so a month ahead.  My question is this:  does the meat get preserved in all the sugar and fruit?  I worry about the meat spoiling from being in the frig that long.  Thanks for any help you can give. ', '          In the past, I detested mincemeat because I have only had the kind that comes in a jar. This time, I decided to try to make some from scratch, as my son and daughter-in-law asked me to for their Victorian style Christmas dinner (they are experimenting with old-fashioned meals; they no doubt thought that Mom should experiment, too). I chose this recipe because it was rated highly--I found out for good reason! ', '          My husband loves mincemeat pies. I cannot even stomach the thought of one, and almost gagged when I opened a store bought jar of the stuff. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I followed some other reviews and made it a month ahead of time and doubled the recipe. I made no other changes. It smelled wonderful when I would stir it weekly. I made traditional mince pies (mini pies) for Thanksgiving and only made a dozen, thinking no one but my husband would eat them. I was so wrong! They were delish! Hearty, spicy and sweet! I made another two dozen and had plenty of mincemeat left over for Christmas. I froze the rest of the mincemeat and made another two dozen for Christmas. This is now a regular recipe for us. Thanks so much for giving us a new and delicious family tradition! ', '          I made this pie for my parents on Thanksgiving.  They love mincemeat pie but. I one has made it since my grandma passed away!  This did not taste like hers but several times that day my dad commented how good the pie was!  It certainly is. Or a cheap pie to make but it. Was worth seeing the smiles my parents had on their faces! ', ""          I ended up making the candied orange and lemon peelfrom scratch (other stuff full of chemicals). I saved the orange syrup and added 1/2 cup to the mincemeat mixture then reduced the white sugar to 1 scant cup. OMG so deeeelish. This pie has a wonderful full, rich flavor. I can't stop tasting it. "", ""          I don't know much about mincemeat pie, but I do have to say this recipe was scrumptious! ""]"
Baked Ham with Sweet Glaze,"[""          Best ham glaze I've ever had. I followed the directions as written. This one is a keeper! "", '           I followed recipe to the letter.

Fresh Cherry Muffins,"[""          As directed, the batter comes out thicker then a pie crust dough. I added some water since I ran out of mil and hoped for the best.

They were fantastic and I‚Äôll be using the basic recipe with other fruits in the future. ', ""          These are fantastic! The texture and taste is fabulous. I did need to add extra milk to thin out the batter, as other reviewers have mentioned. I used almond milk instead of milk, and avocado oil for the vegetable oil (just what i keep in house). i will say that i even messed up and didn't use enough cherries, because i didn't have as many as i thought i had, and the muffins are still delicious. even the loser muffins at the end that had like no cherries were good. i definitely recommend using the almond extract as the recipe recommends. can't wait to make this again with the appropriate amount of cherries! yum! oh one more thing - i doubled the recipe and got a yield of 15 muffins (i think i overfilled the muffin tin but they still turned out great). "", '          I will use less cherries next time, probably 3/4 cup. ', '          Made it vegan by using 1/4 cup applesauce instead of egg and almond milk instead of cows milk. ', '          Changed up a bit. Used 1/2 whole wheat pancake mix and regular flour. Added one large smashed banana. And 1 teaspoon vanilla. ', '          When I started to make this recipe, I realized that the batter was the same as I use for To Die for Blueberry Muffins with streusel topping - my favorite muffin recipe. This recipe has a foolproof method of measuring the correct amount of wet ingredients which seems to be a problem for some who have tried this recipe. Add 1/3 cup oil to a liquid measuring cup. Add the egg and use a fork to break up the egg and blend the egg and oil. Fill the cup to the 1 cup line with milk and stir the liquid. Add any flavorings you like such as vanilla or almond. This method seems to provide the correct amount of wet ingredients and I have never had a bad turnout with the recipe. This version with sweet cherries was outstanding. ']"
Easy Fruit Cobbler,"['          Sometimes you just need something fast. I made it twice, once with canned peaches and once with frozen berries.

Recipe didn‚Äôt say whether or not to peel the peaches, so I didn‚Äôt.  I had some peaches to use up, threw in a few strawberries, and this was a totally simple recipe to make, almost like a dump cake.  I also think canned peaches would work well in this, as we head out of  peach season. ', ""          This is just like my mother's peach cobbler recipe from the 1960s. It's perfect without a single change and everybody loves it.  My mother's recipe calls for 3/4 cup flour rather than 1 cup, but otherwise is identical.  I've made it with fresh peaches, fresh blueberries and canned peaches, and all are equally delicious.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream is almost essential! ""]"

Everyone in my house (and some family who was here when I made them) agreed that the frosting was too sweet and eventually we decided to omit it completely. (And it does make WAY too much frosting!)

Baked Fresh Cherry Pie,"[""          It's so good!

If I were to make this again, I‚Äôd bake in an 8‚Äù springform pan and then be prepared to cook longer.

Chef John's Classic Rice Pudding,"['          This was delicious, so creamy and yummy. I did add a bit more sugar, and I added cardamom powder to mine as well.

BC Cherry Jam,"[""          I made this last year.  I didn't have powdered pectin, only liquid.

Instead of using 4 ounces, if you use 2 packages you are only using  3.5 ounces.  #2  The directions ask for 3 cups pitted, chopped fresh cherries...I use a kitchen scale, so when you pit the cherries they will weigh less.  3 cups of pitted Bing cherries is 675 grams...you may be measuring with the pits IN...the directions want the measurement of already pitted cherries.  Pit then measure...If you don\'t have one, do yourself a BIG favor...get yourself a scale that measures grams and ounces and then some...it makes it much easier in figuring out recipes...  I learned this from bread baking...weights do make a difference in accuracy...Hope this helps... ', ""          I really liked this recipe! Cooked up very well and preserved nicely.

Paleo Almond Date Cookies,"[""          I'm sorry but I found these to be tasteless.  I also added molasses and an extra egg to help with how dry it was.  I don't think I missed anything.  Reread the recipe to make sure I followed it perfectly.  Maybe alter it to your own liking.  I like how they were sugar free though. "", '           They look beautiful! I used honey instead of maple syrup, and added some slivered almonds just because I could.

I can't make any recipe without messing with it just a bit so I subbed 1/2 cup of golden flax flour and since I'm not really watching calories or sugar I added a touch more maple syrup. Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb.

I followed the baking instructions exactly and the cookies were slightly crispy on the bottom/edges and perfectly flaky (not too dry) in the middle. For the recipe, I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I omitted the cherries, walnuts, maple syrup, vanilla... it was still perfect! I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe! "", '           These were delicious. I didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them!

Cherry Cream Cheese Cake,"[""          I didn't have a bundt pan or funnel pan, so I baked it in 2 loaf pans.  This is a dense cake, however I added a scoop of sour cream to keep it from being dry.  I always add sour cream to a baked item when someone's review says it was dry.  I made a cream cheese spread to put on individual slices. "", '          Another delicious keeper for me. I followed the baker who used less flour and more sugar, and I poured some of the cherry juice in too. I used Marischino üçí cherries. I don‚Äôt have an angel food pan, so I used a Bundt pan. I also drizzled the top with some white vanilla icing. Next time I‚Äôd use more pecans and more cherries. All in all, a very flavorful pound cake with good texture that actually tasted better the next day. Crispy on the outside, perfectly smooth on the inside. Also great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing! ', '          I just added a can of thick cream to this mixture and it was perfect‚Ä¶.yummy ', '           You can use 1/4 cup less of the sugar and it is still sweet when you add Cherry frosting over it. Yummy! ', ""          My family loved it! Took the advice from other viewers and added more sugar and less flour. Used dried fig because I didn't have cherries, and just sifted some powdered sugar on top.  Will definitely be making this again. "", '          Could I just give this ten stars??  I made my cake very close to the original (but I did substitute maraschino cherries, as an option that the author suggested & I used 2 small jars of cherries, well-drained & halved).  I used almost the same measurements for sugar & flour as in the original, but in order to add some extra sweetness (as other reviewers had recommended) I chose to add approx. 1 - 1¬Ω cups of white chocolate chips to the cherry/flour mixture, coating all well before I added them to the batter.  You\'d never guess the white chips were in there, yet they add an extra level of yumminess to this already delightful cake.  To take it ""over the top"", I added a drizzle of melted white chocolate (with just a tad of veg. shortening) & thinned with cherry juice.  My chocolate-loving husband gave this an enthusiastic thumbs-up & said it would be even BETTER than cookies at Christmas time. ', '           It looked delicious! Taste was good, however too dry. I always make a recipe the way it is written the first time I try it. I would definitely make some of the adjustments in some of the other reviews in the future. ', '          II made two changes. I divided this into two loaf pans because my husband wanted loaf pans size and I baked it for 50 miinutes. It was moist and delious ', '          I made the adjustments suggested by naples. I made them into cupcakes, baking for 22 mins. They turned out good. I coated the  cups with ground almonds at first but decided that for cupcakes they were too crumby and used paper liners instead. I also cut the cherries into quarters.  They were moist and rich, I would make these again. ']"
Maraschino Cherry Nut Cake,"['          Followed previous advice & used butter Crisco and 11/2 tsp of almond extract in cake batter..baked in 9x13 pan for 30-35 minutes.

Instead of adding food coloring to frosting used very small amount of cherry juice & got a nice soft pink color. ', ""          This cake was so good.  I made sure I sifted the dry ingredients 3 times I also omitted the nuts just because I don't like them. lol I did add a teaspoons of almond extract and I used butter flavored crisco. Cake was moist and light. I used a buttercream "", ""          I didn't care for it but come to find out, my baking powder was outdated which is most likely the reason it didn't rise properly. "", ""          I have been making this  cake for many years but never use pecans, I always use black walnut pieces.  I have a few other changes that I do to make it more moist and lighter however, don't want to bore anyone with this information. "", '          My Maraschino Cherry cake came out very dry & crumbly. ', ""          I followed this recipe to the tee and there are some flaws with it. First, there is no way you can get 2 9in pans worth of cake out of that batter.  If you try, the cook time won't be right.  30 min will make the cake tuff on the outside.  Second, there wasn't enough cherries.  There were some pieces of cake that didn't have ANY cherries in it!!!! I'm going to give it another try(with alterations) before I kick this recipe to the curb! "", ""          The cake was very heavy.  My family of five didn't care for it. I wouldn't make this cake again, "", ""          This cake was just alright.  Not quite as light as I had expected, but my toddlers gobbled it up just the same.  Next time, I'll make it without frosting - it adds way too much sweetness to an already sweet cake. "", '          This recipe is excellent.  It presents beautifully.  I did alter the frosting just a tad.  Instead of the food coloring, I used the cherry juice and some very finely diced marashino cherries.  It gave the frosting a very nice pink tint and the little chunks of cherry gave the frosting a little variety in texture.  I also made this recipe into cupcakes and you do have to be careful not to overbake it.  It can dry out.  All in all, this is as close to my grandmothers recipe that I have found. ']"
Bing Cherry Congealed Salad,"[""          I read through several of the reviews to make modifications - especially Jan's.  My entire family loved it!

I heated the cherry and pineapple juice with the jello added then poured in the coke. I put this mixture in the frig for 30 min then added the fruit, nuts and ""cubed"" cream cheese...stirred and let sit overnite. When ready to serve I set the mold in a sink of warm water for a few minutes...this loosened it from the edges  which allowed me to successfully flip it over for a beautifully ,delicious, molded salad! Received tons of compliments on the taste as well as the beauty. ', '          My grandmother made this for every holiday. I make it for my family now. We love it! ', '          I don\'t know if I will make this again. Everything was fine until I added the (cut up) cream cheese. It was downhill from there. I used electric beaters to ""fluff"" the jello and cream cheese, etc.and it didn\'t happen. I wound up with white speckled jello. Maybe I should have spent more time fluffing the jello up. Maybe the cream cheese should be at room temperature. I think more precise instructions are needed for this recipe. ', '          A favorite with my husband.  Have made many times over the years usually at holidays.  The cream cheese does melt into the hot jello giving it a creamy look and smooth taste... ', '          We have used a recipe like this in my family since the 50s. This is the closest thing I could find.  We always use black cherry jello and we do not blend in the cream cheese .  We cube the cream cheese and add it as well as the other ingredients to the jello mixture when it is syrupy. This keeps the it evenly distributed throughout the salad.  There is an art to the cream cheese. It helps to have it almost frozen but not quite for the cubes to keep their shape. Too frozen and the cream cheese will turn powdery. ', '          This recipe has been in my family for many years. (With only a few alterations.) We just always called it ""Coke Salad"" for lack of the appropriate name. The only difference is we also add a box of Strawberry Jello along with the Cherry. The key to mixing in the cream cheese is to let it soften before adding. Make sure to chip it very fine before adding. (Or add it while the Jello mixture is still somewhat warm.) Don\'t know if there is a difference in Bing Cherries and Dark Cherries but we always used the latter. ']"

Real simple easy winner! ', '          This was wonderful. So easy to make, light and delicious, and  not too sweet.

Cherry Cheesecake Brownies,"[""          I'm going to attempt the recipe, but you should know that the ingredient list calls for 4 eggs, Step 2 uses 4 eggs, and Step 3 calls for 1 egg.

Very disappointed ', ""           A couple notes. 1) There's a lot more of the cheesecake topping than I expected, and it covered more of the top than the promo pictures show. 2) Don't get rid of all the jelly stuff from the cherry pie filling. Use some of it on the brownies. 3) I needed to bake this for about an hour rather than the 35-45 minutes stated in the recipe.

I followed the recipe except used a 15x9 pan and put the filling on top which was gorgeous.  Delicious, rustically pretty and simple. Thank you! ', '          It was ok.  I followed the directions exactly.  The cake texture was similar to a coffee cake.  It was best warm.  It just did not have a lot of flavor.

', '          I was given a basket of fresh figs and came looking for a recipe. I was drawn to the simplicity of this one and also the good reviews. Because I have a tiny kitchenette in which to cook, I used a food processor rather than a standard mixer. I only changed a few things‚ÄîI pur√©ed the figs, I omitted almond extract, used half and half instead of evaporated milk and added a handful of chopped pecans. The batter was delicious and I had high hopes. I used my silicon muffin ‚Äútin‚Äù (1/2 cup per muffin; made 8). I baked for 45 minutes at 350. The muffins came out brown on the outside and doughy in the inside. Not good. I don‚Äôt know exactly what went wrong. ', '          Doubling the recipe worked well for 9"" cake pans. As a commercial grower we store many frozen figs that thaw to be very soft and this is ideal for mashing rather than chopping in this recipe. The filling requires a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to avoid over cooking to proper thickness. Really a splendid cake! ', ""          Made in a 9x13 pan instead of layers. Easy to make. Icing taste great. My figs were a little sweet to start with. Haven't cut the cake yet... Still hot. But I'm sure it's going to be delicious... Smelled yummy baking. ""]"
Fig Preserves,"['          First an important note. Lemosn naturally contain pectin, so they are absolutely necessary to help this gel nicely.  I slice mine paper thin on a mandolin so they cook down to nothing, but leave their bright flavor and geling qualities behind.  I also shop the figs coarsely after draining from their boiling bath so I get more of a jam and not so much whole fruit. Love this with a scrape of vanilla beans and a cinnamon stick or star anise cooked in the jam. Process as usual for jams and itis a huge hit. ', '           Ripping Good Recipe. Super easy to make.

It‚Äôs really easy. Costco carried Fig Jam at one time and we fell in love with it.  And after a run they discontinued it.  I had no  idea it was so easy to make, so when figs are in season I make fig jam ', '          This is delicious and so easy!  I make it exactly as written, but I also add a dash of cinnamon.  Almost as good as my grandmother used to make. ', ""          This is the best recipe I've found for Fig Preserves like my Mimi and MaMaw used to make when I was little!

Fresh Fig Freezer Jam,"['           This was my first time ever making jam or jelly. I read all the reviews thoroughly and decided to take all the advice and pull it together. I definitely used the little food processor or chopper to chop my figs. Also, there was not a packet of liquid CERTO pectin to be found in the store.  ?? I ended up purchasing the powdered sister-product to CERTO - Sure-Jell.  When I mixed in the sugar and the Sure-Jell, I also found that the sugar was not dissolving and mixing in well. I put it on a low heat until the sugar was dissolved and it made a thick jam. I reduce the sugar to approximately 3 to 3 1/2 cups as I definitely didn‚Äôt want it too sweet. At first taste it‚Äôs a bit too much lemon so I‚Äôm hoping that will meld together as it cools and sits for a bit and that the sugar will continue to dissolve well.  It‚Äôs nice and thick, the way jam should be. Also not icky sweet. I am using this on an authentic Italian bruschetta with brie, prosciutto, and arugula, so you want a bit of sweetness, but, not overpowering. I‚Äôm excited to try it I did put it on a cracker with some laughing cow Swiss cheese and it was delicious! ?? ????? ? i‚Äôm super excited to share it with our friends this weekend and hear what they have to say.

At the end I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to it and cooked before I froze it.  My reason for cooking it was that I was trying to make it thicker.

Fig-Ricotta Cake,"[""           This was outstanding!  Rich, moist, perfection.   Took 60 minutes in convection oven at 350 degrees, but just one part of the loaf was not cooked on top in the middle at the highest point just about equal to a tablespoon.   Didn't want to bake it any longer because the ends would be too dry.  Next time I may add 5 more minutes.  Only substitutes I made were I used butter to coat pan versus nonstick cooking spray and when it cooled it was a just a bit tough to remove, but I slid a flat serving utensil on all sides and then lifted it a bit with two utensils.  It was still warm after a half hour of cooling, sooooo good!  The other thing I used was a very good vanilla extract versus almond extract.  Not a big fan of almond flavor as it is in so many Italian cookie recipes.  I added a photo and you will see where it cracked a bit when I took it out of pan because I didn't coat the pan enough.

My kids and husband all loved this.  I agree with other reviewers that the figs are not a big part of the flavor, more of a moist spice cake.  I did not change anything except to leave out the pecans as my family are not fond of nuts in baked goods. ', ""          Very good....very moist.  I added about 2 1/2 cups of figs, and probably could have added a bit more flour, it is moist and very good.  I think its a little sweet, though my figs were very sweet too....taking that in mind, I'd cut the sugar a bit next time...frosting was delish.  Alot like caramel....very yummy overall! ""]"

Kept everything else the same using lemon vs lime, just seemed a better fit. I didn‚Äôt smash the berries first because I figured the immersion would do them in anyway.

Pear-Fig Salad,"['           This was a really nice salad!

Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Balsamic-Fig-Basil Sauce,"[""          It's much better than I thought it'd be.

You won't be disappointed! Make this for company and holidays or just for a nice dinner! Yum! "", ""          Wow. I LOVED the seasoning. I had a 5 pound lamb but the way it was shaped after we unrolled it we decided to cut it in half so it was now only 2.5 pounds.  We cooked one in the instant Pot and one in the oven as directed.  After 25 minutes at 400  in the oven, it was not done at all so I added another 10 minutes and it still was only 100 degrees inside. I cooked it a little more and then decided to take it out because the Intant pot one was done. I doubled all the seasonings and I was very happy with it. I probably didn't need to double the fig sauce. I used some dried figs that were not the figs mentioned. I also found a bottle of the liquor that was the size of an airline bottle for only $3. My kids gave me 8.5 and 9 rating. Husband said 9, so this is really high so I will make this for an occasion and now know to  cook it longer in the oven and lesss time in the instant pot. 25 minutes in the inlant pot would have been fine.  Then glaze in the oven.  I should not have cooked it more in the pot. "", '          I followed the recipe with no substitutions.  AMAZING!!!  I will make it like this from now on!  I cooked it at 350 degrees, checked it at 40 minutes, then another 20 minutes, and then another 10 minutes until it reached 135 degrees.  It was medium well in the center.

I definitely would triple the herb recipe and use the currants and cassis if you can find it.  I also would suggest only the first 25-30 mins at 400 and then lowering your oven temp to 325.  Lastly as other posters have mentioned- TAKE IT OUT OF THE OVEN AT 125-130.  Over cooked lamb has no flavor- let it rest under foil till temp hits 130-135.

I reduced on low for quite a while, maybe 40 "", ""          This is so delicious.  However I didn't have whiskey so I used coconut rum. Great with cheese and very addictive.

Chicken Tenders with Balsamic-Fig Sauce,"['          Made just the sauce to serve over leftover chicken legs and loved it.

Fabulous Fig Scones,"['          These are not scones. The batter was runny, like cake batter. I added an extra 1/2 C oats, but that did not help.

Flavor is fine, but not good enough to want to make these again. ', '          Very, very good. ', '          While it had great flavor, not easy to bake. Dough too wet even after adding extra flour.

MOST popular - definitely will be doing this again - and the grill mess is a small price to pay. ', ""          Made exactly as written. Loved the grilled figs! Loved all of it except ... the Burrata cheese was sort of underwhelming. The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such.  This was good, just not quite perfection for me. "", '          I made this with fresh figs from the garden.

', ""           So lovely.  I'd never had grilled figs before, but holy whoa, they were DELICIOUS.  I didn't even have a grill--I just used a cast iron skillet.  My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it.  The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild.  Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here.  The figs are what make it. ""]"

Three minor changes I made were 1) to use Panache Tiger Strip Fig 2) topped with diced thick sliced bacon instead of prosciutto and 3) I didn't drizzle with honey as the figs were juicy and sweet on their own. Truly delicious! Shared the recipe with friends; will definitely make this again. "", '          The addition of prosciutto sounds wonderful! Being that my paternal grampa was from Greece I highly recommend trying this recipe with Feta instead of goat cheese ;-) They taste awesome grilled too!

Fig and Ricotta Crostini,"['          I had leftover fig and pine nut puree from the Dolce Pesca recipe on this site. Since I happened to have ricotta in the house, this was a perfect way to use it up. I did half with the puree and half with diced figs. On all of them, instead of just putting ""a few ribbons"" of basil, I covered the whole piece of bread with basil, which I think added a lot of flavor. The ones with the puree had more flavor, held the vinegar better, and you could put a lot more topping than with the diced figs. The diced fig ones were noticeably less flavorful, probably because they didn\'t hold as much vinegar. If I make this again, I will do the puree, and add the vinegar to the puree instead of drizzling. ', ""          This is my recipe.

Dolce Pesca (Sweet Peaches),"['           9.1.18  My figs were very ripe, and I was concerned that if I put them in the blender, they‚Äôd turn to mush, so I chopped them as well as the pine nuts.

Needed to find a way to use the fresh figs I had picked at my best friend's house. The combination was wonderful. I didn't use the food processor to grind up the figs and pine nuts, just cause I didn't have one available to me...but I think that it gave it a great textural element. Next time I might toast the nuts prior to combining them with the figs. Thank you Laura for sharing this recipe; this was a great way to end our Italian feast.

Melon Smoothie,"['          This is more of a melon slurry than a smoothie....there\'s nothing smooth about it.  I made this with honey instead of the sugar and slightly less as honey is sweeter.

Jewel's Watermelon Margaritas,"[""          I made this recipe as directed and really enjoyed this cool, refreshing margarita. It's important to use the white tequila (also know as bianca) for the full margarita effect. Gold tequila is smoother and sweeter.  You don't want to add sweetness to the already sweet watermelon.  Additionally I recommend salting the rims of your glasses over sugar.  The salt helps to mellow the sweetness and intensify the watermelon flavor.  Salud! "", '          Da BOM.COM.  To keep it simple my hubby threw 4 cups (for a double recipe) of scraped-out watermelon into a big blender with the syrup (made with erythritol/monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar BTW!), 3 cups of ice, the lime juice and the tequila, and blended.  DELICIOUS and LETHAL!!! ', '           I didn\'t have tequila on hand but I did have rum so I guess I made watermelon ""daquiritas.""

These are bomb! ', '          AMAZING!!! ', '          I find these quite sweet.  I used 1/2 of the simple syrup and will try 1/4 next time.  Served on the rocks.

I blitzed in a food processor and then filtered through a fine colander for more of a ‚Äúwatermelon juice‚Äù consistency. I can see why some people preferred to freeze the fruit and make this more like a slushie - I think that‚Äôs the way to go if you want to keep the pulp.

Watermelon Preserves,"['          Followed to the T....but it candied. Tastes good, tho. ', '          I would suggest throwing the melon and lemon into the blender to liquefy it prior to cooking? Maybe that would have helped. I ended up with two pint jars of thick weird textured product. I added ginger for flavor that did make it taste better, but still weirdest creation I ever made. I would not recommend it. ', '           I used my electric pressure cooker (2 hours on stew (I checked the temp after the first cycle 220 exactly)  to cook the melon and lemon and I used darker natural sugar.   I‚Äôve heard the smell is meh they are right but tastes great!    Next time I‚Äôll add fresh mint as well. ', '          Thinking of trying it with strawberries in it too. ', '          Please forgive, I haven\'t made this yet.  Dad was the expert on tasting watermelon rind preserves: his sister Orene always won the blue ribbon, ergo his opinion was accurate.  Pappy (granddad, a farmer) was famous for the best watermelons in New Albany Mississippi area.  Dad:  Rind has to be thick but tender with no green left on - green parts cook up tasteless and leathery.  Which is extremely hard to find because those traits mean melons don\'t ship well (break easily) and were bred out of fruit in commerce now.   Pappy\'s melons were so intensely flavored you\'d dream of them all winter!  Their rinds trimmed of all green and pink were over 1"" thick and snow white.  Today rinds are thin, tough as nails, greenish.  Farmers tell me to hunt out seeded watermelons, especially heirloom types, which are the sweetest and best tasting anyway.  Farmers have to grow some to pollinate seedless ones.  Also, Dad said lemon spoils the flavor completely.  Orene didn\'t use it.   The flavor should be reminiscent of citron.  Factoid:  a white meat watermelon was grown in the south just for it\'s rind which was candied and used as a substitute for more expensive citron.  Dad passed 1 year ago, age 96. ', ""          Did not set, stayed syrup.  Fruit flavor did not come through, I only taste a sweet/slightly burnt taste.  Maybe try another recipe that doesn't cook the fruit so long, and uses pectin. "", ""          The watermelon tasted like burnt squash after being cooked. (it wasn't actually burned) . The added lemon and sugar did little to flavor it.  I would add a flavored gelatin to boost the flavor and add a little thickness to the gel."", ""          My watermelon stayed in chunks that are pretty solid and don't spread like preserves should. I'd suggest finely dicing or pureeing before cooking. I used two lemons and the whole recipe got quite bitter from the rinds - next time I will only use lemon juice and zest. Otherwise, the jam set pretty well after two hours on a low-ish boil. Other reviews say to boil only 1 hour but mine was still soupy liquid at that point. Overall, I'm glad it worked, but I'm not exactly looking forward to eating all this chunky, bitter preserve. "", '          Is definitely more marmalade like than a preserve. I found previous reviews very helpful. We halved the lemon as suggested and added 2 small velencia oranges with rinds. Leave uncovered during simmer to reduce until desired thickness. Our first batch produced 3 half pints. The fruit did not break down and the final product is very chunky with bits of candied watermelon among the rind pieces. Overall, very good but the recipe is missing many important elements and hints. Thank u previous reviewers, very helpful. ']"

"", ""          I followed the recipe exactly but it wasn't golden brown at 45 minutes so I cooked it an hour.

I cut the cantaloupe pretty small and it still had way too much of that definitive cantaloupe flavor except for a few pieces which were pretty small. The texture of the cantaloupe was really off-putting in combination with the rest of it.

Make sure you taste your melon and adjust your sugar amount...I did not add any extra sugar since my melon was naturally sweet and with the cake mix it was really still too sweet for my liking.  Everyone who tired this raved.  I won't use this recipe again but it has inspired me to create my own without using a box mix so I can control the sweetness.  Another suggestion, make sure your melted butter covers the entire cake mix top or you will have powdery spots.  Maybe use more than 1/2 cup melted butter or spread it out with a spatula after you drizzle it over the top "", ""          This was good, but I did some altering after reading reviews: cut the sugar to 1/3 c. and the cake mix to 1/2 a box [used Jiffy yellow cake, 9 oz].

Cantaloupe Bread with Praline Glaze,"['          The bread was delicious. Like others, I skipped the topping to avoid the calories. I also lightened it up a bit.

I added in 1 cup roasted pecans. I didn't make the topping in this recipe. Tasted great! "", ""          I never would think to use cantaloupe to make a quick bread, but I'm so glad I found this recipe!  It is quite possibly my favorite now. I didn't make the glaze & I made mini loaves, so they could be frozen.  I don't think I would change anything in this recipe, except next time, I'm adding nuts to the batter. SO YUMMY! Had it for breakfast today, toasted with a bit of butter. "", ""          I made the recipe exactly as written, though the praline topping was not appealing so I didn't  add it. It was okay but was more bland tasting than I had expected. I haven't given up on the idea but will likely make some changes the next time I make it. I will probably add nuts to the batter and adjust the sugar (reduce) and spices (change or increase). "", '           The bread turned out wonderful‚Äîthe praline glaze not so much. The directions for the glaze need to state the power setting on microwave. I followed directions exactly and my glaze semi-solidified.

I thought the praline glaze went very well with it (I was worried since another commenter said it did not). Probably won't make again because it really doesn't taste like cantaloupe and honestly it reminded me of banana bread -- so I would rather just make the banana bread :) ""]"
Watermelon Pie,"['          I found it best to cut the watermelon into very small pieces and let them sit over a strainer for 10 minutes or so, helping to drain the juices, therefore no runny pie.', ""          Pie was light and tasty.

Cantaloupe Pie I,"['           This is really labor intensive but worth it. If your cantaloupe isn‚Äôt super ripe, you need to up the sugar.

"", '          Very good.  I would do as another user suggested and use as ripe a cantaloupe as possible.  I made some alterations in order to make it slightly healthier.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and used Splenda in the filling (not the meringue) to cut down the sugar.  I used just slightly over 1/4 cup of Splenda and it was fine.  In addition, I used vanilla instead of butter flavoring and that worked well.  Last, I used a graham cracker crust. ', ""          My Mother in Law was making this 50+ years ago without the pie crust. She couldn't remember the recipe so I found it here. This is the most Awesome Pie Ever. I do leave out the butter extract, but only because I didn't have any. And I don't use a pie crust. This is as close to hers as I have found. Be sure to use a great tasting Ripe cantaloupe. Just Awesome!!! "", ""          My husband just had some dental work done so I just made the filling.  This is a really great pudding!!  I didn't have butter extract so I used vanilla instead.  It turned out fantastic.  This would be a great way to get young children who think they don't like cantaloupe to try it.  I think it would change their mind. "", ""           This recipe was great, I didn't tell my husband what kind of pie it was and had him guess, he thought it was banana! I added a couple dashes of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg, and followed the suggestion to use cornstarch to thicken the filling-(Dissolve the cornstarch in small amount of water then add to filling while on stove)My cantaloupe was very ripe(had dents on the skin) so I suggest you use a little less sugar if your's is also and less sugar on the merengue as well. Let the filling thicken on stove considerably before you place in the baked pie crust. After the pie cooled I refridgerated it then served it chilled. ""]"

Perfect Lemon Curd,"['          Took way longer than 6 minutes but it worked:) ', '          5 STAR for Taste and Ease!

You'll not get scrambled eggs this way either.I used the cream-sugar-and-butter-first method given by Anonymous this time and it worked nicely.Don't forget to sterilise the jam jars and lids first using boiling water if you intend to keep the curd for longer.

I also added oats to the second half of the crumble (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. I also add enough vinegar to make it more wet).  You can replace the 6 cups fruit with any variety you want. I‚Äôve done peach blueberry strawberry. Apple raspberry and blueberry etc. it‚Äôs absolutely divine the way I‚Äôve altered it! I highly recommend trying it my way as brown butter is life! Even if you don‚Äôt want brown butter as the comments suggested double the fruit amount. I‚Äôve made it like 5 times now my way lol. I like my crumble crispy so I turned on the Broiler for a second too. ']"
Mandarin Orange Cake,"['          This is one of the MOST delicious, refreshing cakes ever! My sister made it and I immediately asked her to send me the recipe!

Frankly, I was disappointed.  I took the advise of the review that mentioned  reducing the oil to 3/4 C & adding orange extract. Reducing the oil did not work for me. The cake was too dry! I did add the orange extract & even grated in about 2 TBSP of fresh orange zest. The cake itself was still lacking in flavor. (Also - boxed cake mixes are now reduced to 15+ oz, not 18.  I looked it up & discovered that the extra 3 oz was 1/2 C, so I had a 2nd box & added that.) Maybe it would have been more moist without it?  Hard to say.

Candied Lemon Peel,"['          These look beautiful, so maybe I‚Äôll use them as a decorative garnish, but I don‚Äôt like eating them. They‚Äôre tough and much too sweet.

Great recipe "", '          I make this recipe often. I love that I can make a yummy treat instead of throwing away the peel after juicing the lemons.

I find that if I boil the peel for at least 5 minutes each time I change the water it makes the peel much more tender. ', '          I use these candied peels on top of my lemon pound cake.

I didn't have broth so I used chicken bouillon and a couple of veggie bouillon since I was out of celery and only had 1/2 an onion. I also cooked the chicken and orzo in the broth, and I only added maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice to it because my hubby isn't a fan of lemon, and I figured I can always add more to my bowl.

"", ""          I like the taste I added extra lemon so it was stronger flavour and halved the sugar so it wasn't so sweet. Mine came out dense but I don't mind cakes like that. I have a feeling the reason for some they come out dense and didn't really rise. I think it is to do with the amount of baking powder...recipe says 1 3/4 TSP, however the brand of baking powder I used actually says on the container that it requires 2tsp/1 cup of flour so maybe next time I'll try follow the baking powder directions for the brand I bought I stead of in the recipe and see if that makes a difference.

Lemon Cream Cheese Bars,"['          How is it was to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SO VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

', '           I thought the end result was terrific and the process was so easy! (I just had to try one almost the minute I took them out of the oven!) These bars turned out lemony and not too sweet. In recipes like this that call for the crescents to be rolled out in one piece, I always use the sheets vs. the individual rolls. That makes a big difference! I was so tempted to add an egg to the filling because I have made similar recipes in the past that called for one. I DID NOT add any eggs and the filling was perfect! I didn\'t think the bars turned out ""doughy"" as a few others have mentioned. However, I did not line my pan (I used a glass 9x13) with foil. Perhaps that made a difference in how the crescent dough cooked on the bottom. I\'m certain I will make this recipe again! ', ""           I did make a few changes to suit my baking tastes. Instead of using the entire roll of dough, I only placed enough to cover the bottom. Then buttered it lightly as I pressed it into place, with a small amount of sugar  sprinkled on top. Prick the dough so it doesn't puff up in the oven. Bake just until it starts to lightly brown, then cool completely. I increased my sugar to one and one quarter cup to balance out the quarter cup of lemon juice. I added the one egg as suggested by another reviewer. I also added one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and grated in a small amount of nutmeg. Finished off with an eighth of a teaspoon of lemon extract. I wanted the lemon flavor to be pronounced! Again with the second roll of dough, used only enough to cover the top. I used kitchen shears to cut up pieces of dough to fill in any open spots. The end result was great, with a crispy top and bottom and no sogginess from too much dough. I'll save the extra crescent dough for rolls, lol. "", '          This was so easy to make and delicious.  I took it to a gathering where there were several desserts, and this was gone in no time! ', ""          This was a very good dessert. Took other reviewers' advice and baked the bottom layer first, let cool, then proceeded as directed in the original recipe, no soggy crust and overall good lemony taste, no bitterness. Thank you for a good recipe! "", '          I loved these.  I‚Äôm not a fan of lemon so I swirled some eras berry jam thru the cream cheese mixture.  I didn‚Äôt have a problem with the bottom crust but I‚Äôm making them tomorrow for a family dinner so I‚Äôll try pre cooking the bottom crust this time just to see if I like them better.  This time I‚Äôm going to use a blueberry compote. ', '           Yes I used a very generic brand of crescent rolls that did not stretch so I used more than called for on the bottom layer, baked that layer immediately to a nice golden brown then took it out to cool while I made the filling, so another thick layer of generic brand crescent rolls covered the top for the crust, so I used 4 tablespoons of butter to brush on top , then mixed the zest, white sugar and a touch of nutmeg together to sprinkle on top of the raw buttered crescent rolls , spots left a bit open I sprinkled a light amount of sugar on the bare open areas for consistency. Then I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes, took it out to set, then my grandson wanted a taste after 20 minutes and so did I , it was very delicious, very unusual in an unexpected good flavor. I never knew these generic brand crescent rolls would ever transform into a lovely dessert bar such as this.

Lemon-Orange Orange Roughy,"['           I used cod and could not even taste the freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, only lemon pepper seasoning.

Anyhow, I made just a simple lemon glaze icing and today after cooling the batter overnight made a huge difference.

Lemon Garlic Chicken,"['          It was quite good.   I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  When I took the chicken out, I added 2 Tbs of flour to the leftover butter in the pan.

If I had a juicer for the cucumber it would‚Äôve helped. The final product was delicious and refreshing. Very tart and very sweet though, so I‚Äôd suggest adding 1/4-1/2 cup of water at the end to dilute the flavor. ', '          I like the flavor of the cucumber with the lemon, but I felt there was too much lemon.  It almost immediately gave me heartburn from the acid.  I did use bottled lemon juice (1-1/2 cups, per recommendation of another user.)  Next time, I will reduce that to 1 cup and see if it is better.  I had to add more sugar this time to help with the sourness of the lemon, but I may not have to when I reduce the amount of lemon juice.  I had a large overgrown cucumber from the garden to use up.  I got about 3/4 cup juice from it, and put it all in.  Then I added the lemon juice and simple syrup - no need to cool down for a long time.  I put this all in a 2-qt pitcher, added about 1qt ice cubes and filled the rest with cold water, then stirred.  The ice melts and cools down the drink very fast, and the water to flavors ratio was good.  I have some mint and basil in the garden.  I am going to try placing some leaves in individual glasses of this to see how it tastes. ']"

I followed the recipe exactly and used both blackberries and raspberries for mine. There were many in my family who had had cobbler before and they said it was delish. It was mushy, but not in a bad way. It was not super sweet, but not NOT sweet: it was just right with the sugar. My crust got a little too crispy in some areas, but otherwise it was a very satisfying desert.It was also super easy to make. I thought cobblers would be more complicated, like a pie, and was relieved to find I was wrong.This fruit cobbler is a delicious and easy to make dessert that I highly recommend for any bakers, beginner or otherwise.Edit: I have made this with gluten free all purpose flour and oat milk for a fairy and gluten free desert. This cobbler never dissapoints!! ']"

Southern Peach Cobbler,"['           Very  simple recipe. I added an 1/8th of a teaspoon of Baking Powder, a little more sugar and a dash of corn starch. It was very delicious!! ', ""          A few things I forgot in my review. It took 60 mins to get the golden I wanted, at 350. I might bump that up a bit. Also I think you can reduce the sugar to 2/3- 3/4 of a cup. It was super sweet. I saw peeps complaining about it being mushy. I think that's from not letting your casserole and butter get to temp. Just melting the butter isn't enough, you need it bubbling. That way the batter starts to cook and rise as soon as you put it in the casserole. Using glass is also the best way to go.I'm now making another cobbler from this recipe, with mixed frozen berries and fresh blueberries with the sweetening reduced and sugar replaced with Splenda.   üëç "", '          My husband loved it.

I just couldn't bring myself to use completely raw eggs. I am so glad I cut the sugar. It was perfect at 2 cups. The sugar is the only reason I took a star off. It would have been way to sweet with the sugarstated. My husband told me it was the best ice cream I've made. Absolutely delish. Just beware it makes a double batch for most ice cream makers.

I think I used about 7 fresh peaches (one Aldi\'s 32 oz bag full) sliced thinly and sauteed them in a stick of butter until tender ( a good 20 mins)- added lemon juice and lots of brown sugar and cinnamon sugar to taste - a pinch of salt too ( half teaspoon as the butter is salty too). Since my peaches were pre-cooked -I baked for 30 mins at 400 F .  I checked biscuit with a knife and turned it off while we did an errand and ate dinner. It was perfect an hour later.

Marie's Peach Dump Cake,"[""          The first time I made it it was cake like and delicious and there preaches stayed intact.  The second time it was mushy. I really don't know what I did wrong the second time. But both tasted absolutely delicious! "", '          This came out pretty good. I tried to make a smaller batch than the recipe but I think my math was off. I could have used more peaches and a little more cake mix. Overall I liked it. Added a little cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste wide both were good adds. It was more peach crumble than peach pie but I prefer that. I would recommend this recipe ', ""          I've never had much luck with dump cakes because the cake mix stays dry, but I needed something quick to take. I only wanted a small pan so I used an 8x8 and one can of peaches in fruit juice. Half a boxed cake mix is 1-2/3 cup so that on top of peaches. Then I GRATE my cold butter over all. Once the butter melts in the oven I lightly stir it around with a fork so the cake mix is evenly dampened. After it starts to bubble around the edges I break the top up with a fork (don't stir) so the juice bubbles all over and creates a yummy topping. You don't have to worry about the cake falling because it stays more like a crust so open your oven as often as you need to to prevent those powdery places! Tasted great! I didn't change the recipe, just the process a little. "", ""          It was easy, but very thin so it didn't make as many servings. It is like a Cobbler."", '          Was very easy, next time I going to try it with different fruit.  Used the french vanilla cake mix.  Was very sweet... ', ""          I made this recipe with the suggested tweaks of using only half of the cake mix and melting the butter for better distribution.   It was SO sweet.  If you like really sweet things, you will probably like this recipe, but it was way too much for me.  One thought I had, though, is that it might be good as a topping on plain oatmeal.  I don't plan on making it again. "", '          This is not a cake. This is more of a ‚Äúcrisp‚Äù or ‚Äústreusel‚Äù', '          Tastes good but it came out mostly powdery on top.

Peachy Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce,"['           Very yummy üòä ', ""           This recipe is a family favorite! Honestly, better than you can find at any restaurant! Normally, I tweak recipes to my own liking but this one is perfect as written! Ok, one small tweak I made was to double the rum in the sauce but that's just because I like a heavier rum flavor! "", '           Heaven! I‚Äôm the kind of person who rarely makes a recipe as written. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to infuse and enhance for more flavor and I typically do a thorough read of the reviews for inspiration on alterations. Number one, I used a whole loaf of crusty, 3 day old French bread. It ended up being a little over ten cups. I started with less than that, but it needed all of it to fully absorb the amount of liquid I ended up with since I used 3 fresh, very juicy peaches. Two of them were a little less soft and ripe, so I baked them for 15 min with a little brown sugar, butter, and a mixture of honey, maple syrup, and a dash of rum extract drizzled over. Instead of 1 1/4 cups of just water, I used the liquid from a can of fruit cocktail (just cuz it was what we had on hand) mixed with the liquid leftover from the baked peaches, and water for the remaining amount. I added one extra egg. I ended up with a perfect ratio of bread to custard and it perfectly filled a 9x13 pan. I ended up letting it sit and soak more in the fridge for about an hour while I prepared the rest of dinner. Baking for 1 hour at 325 was just right. Instead of rum in the sauce, I used half rum extract and half vanilla extract and the rummy flavor was just right for me. Served it with vanilla ice cream. One of the best desserts I‚Äôve made, maybe ever. Dad said he was going to the store to buy more ingredients for me to make it again lol. ', '          AWESOME RECIPE! DEFENTLY I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.    THE CARMEL SAUCE IS  GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT ON ICE CREAM  OR WITH SLICED APPLES.  YUMMY! ', '          This turned out incredible. The family loved it. I will make this again. For the caramel sauce i substituted 2 tbs of Crown Royal Peach instead of the rum. ', '          I just finished the recipe the flavoring is delicious, however I added 1 additional cup of  water because the bread absorbed the egg batter leaving it dry. Otherwise my early thinking made it all worth it. ', '          So good!  We used 2t vanilla instead of rum (as stated in notes) and poured it over the top in the 9x13, turns out delicious every time. ', ""          This recipe was very good with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviews, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The bread pudding itself was a decent base but definitely needed more peaches (I used 1 quart of home-canned but will use 2 next time) and at least 1 additional egg (I used 4, but will use 5 next time).  I also reserved the juice the peaches were in and used that instead of water.  I used 1 package of hot dog buns which turned out great as it used them up and I didn't want to go out and buy French bread."", ""          Inadvertently overcooked it, but still good.  I added an extra egg and  1 cup bread per other suggestions.  Next time may use canned or frozen peaches as I don't enjoy peeling fresh peaches! ""]"

', ""          An easy summer dessert to have prepped and in the fridge, awaiting a brief stint in the oven or bbq after the main meal is cooked. As per other reviewers, I used fresh (Ontario) peaches, regular brown sugar, and doubled the vanilla.  I'm guessing the better the peaches (and ripeness), the better the flavour.  We did serve this in individual heatproof greased crocks (for quicker baking and serving), with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream and a side of cinnamon walnut coffee cake.  I also made two other individual servings using artificial sweetener (used different small crocks to differentiate);  I should have dissolved in melted butter first as the powder didn't dissolve during the baking process, although the two guests that had those enjoyed them after stirring it up a bit.

Fresh Peach Pie I,"['          My first try at fruit pie.  I cheated and used Pillsbury ready-to-bake crust.  Baked as directed and set aside to cool.

I did start layering with sauce first, then peaches, alternately layering til full.  (Thanks to those that gave user comments for me to consider.)  Looked beautiful, next time no fork, see photo.

Pear Pie III,"['          hey this was a great recipe 5 stars for it ', '           This was delicious and beautiful.  Everyone really liked it.  I used three pears and it was perfect.

It was a nice alternative to apple pie at thanksgiving. ', ""           I haven't actually cut the pie yet, but I did pick a few pieces of fruit off of the top. Delicious. A few changes were made because of the ingredients that were already in the house. I used about 6 small sand pears and 2 small golden delicious apples. Because I had so much fruit (I had to use it all as the apples were becoming wrinkled in the fruit bowl) I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Used all spice instead of cardamom. 1/8 teaspoon of ginger and almond essence. I also did not use all of the liquid.  As you can see from the picture, I didn't arrange the fruit either.   The pears stay crunchy. Crust nice. I prefer a sweet crust.  Husband loved it "", '          Fantastic recipe as is, but also super flexible. Have used whatever fruit or jam I have on hand with equally delicious results. Makes quite and impression when brought to dinner parties.

She does drain out the orange juice - otherwise you will have an apple tart mess. She pain stakingly arranges the fruit in a beautiful design, and the presentation is gorgeous. She has made it in small pans for individual servings and in a large pan. It's simply delicious. "", ""          I had trouble with the crust.  I used gf flour but even so, the dough was just crumbly and couldn't be rolled out.  I ended up pressing it into the pans. "", ""          This is a very nice adaptable method!

Sooo I took the next review and turned it up to high. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger to the cream cheese mixture PLUS 1 1/2 teaspoons of finely diced candied ginger (Penzey\'s) to the cream cheese and sugar mixture. Wow! This is fabulous.

Maple-Pear Tarte Tatin,"[""          This was a wonderful recipe! I started it and then realized I was out of puff pastry, so I used phyllo instead- a little butter between the sheets and it was golden. Aside from that the only thing I think I'd do again is add a pinch of salt to the sauce. It was soooo good! Yum! "", '          I used phyllo dough on the bottom as opposed to the puff pastry, gave it more of a baklava texture. ', '           This came out really good.  The syrup is really was sweet with a nice maple flavor. Another reviewer includes bourbon which would go great with this flavor profile.  The puff pastry was soft but not mushy. My husband was able to pick it up and eat it like a slice of pizza. Overall, its a was great recipe that is easy to make. ', '           I followed the recipe , I drained most of the juice out of the skillet before baking.  I took the pastry out and put on a plate right side up and put the remaining juice around the plate.  I kept it right side up so the pastry would not get soggy.  Thanks for the great recipe! ', '          My husband took this out of the oven, flipped it, and started to eat it. He declares it delicious. ', '          I made it just as written and it was excellent!  I pears were extra firm, which I was worried about but it turned out great.  Will for sure make again. ', ""          I would definitely make this again.

Puff pastry tends to always be a little chewy (I use it in other recipes such as chicken pot pie), so maybe next time I might try another option, like phyllo. ']"
Bartlett Pear Pie,"[""          What a mess!! This is a soupy mess. I cooked it for 45 minutes and it never set. Don't make it!! "", '          Watery mess.  Good flavor . ', '          WET DISASTER. Baked for 50 minutes and it is still terrible. House smells great though. ', '           I\'ve never made a fresh fruit pie before so I was glad to find a good base recipe to experiment with.  (Tip: If you\'re working with fresh pears, the easiest way that I\'ve found to peel them is to boil them for about 20-30 seconds one at a time and have a bowl of cold water on hand.  After you boil one, just plop it in the bowl and just lightly rub on the skin under water with your thumb...peels right off and the skins just sink to the bottom.)  After I peeled and cut them I put them in a gallon plastic bag and poured about a shot each of brandy and spiced rum.  I also put all of the spices in the bag that the recipe called for (with a little extra cinnamon bc I like the flavor).  I let it marinate in the fridge for about 6ish hours and then prepared the filling.  I felt the pie needed a ""topping"" so on half of the pie I sprinkled some Coach\'s Oats on the top.     Results:  Flavor was excellent!  I liked the oat side better than the non-oat side but both were good.  I didn\'t dry off the pears or try to dehydrate them a little before adding the liquor and such so it turned out a bit more liquidy than I\'d like so I think next time I\'m going wipe them down a bit with some paper towels before adding the liquids...and maybe bake it about 5ish minutes longer. ', '          This was easy and fast and taste great. I baked it for 40 min. Will make again! ', '          I made it exactly to the directions.  It was runny and had too much allspice.  Next time I will try adding tapioca pudding mix and baking a little longer.  I will add more cinnamon and less allspice.  I was sad this time though since I made three for my work Christmas party.  Everyone was excited to try it and it was just mediocre. ', '          As usual, I lacked some of the ingredients. Only had about 2/3 of the white sugar, so substituted Splenda brown sugar for the rest of the white as well as the brown sugar. Found a recipe for allspice- 1/3 each of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Used salted butter- no unsalted. Greased the bottom of a 9x9 inch pan, because I had no crust. ', '           I make this pie with coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free. ']"
French Pear Pie,"[""           This recipe is so easy and so tasty! I used canned pears and no lemon (didn't have any).

Only complaint is that it was too juicy. Next time I'll add corn starch to the fruit mixture. "", ""          This was really good.  My pears seemed a bit juicy, so I added just a little bit of flour to the pears before putting the crumb topping on.  I also added a bit of ginger to the crumb topping.  The only complaint I have is that it was still very wet after baking causing a bit of sogginess, but the flavor was delightful. I love that it wasn't a pear pie trying to be an apple pie. ""]"

French Puff Pastry Tart with Pears and Chocolate,[]
Frangipane Pear Tart,"['          Show stopper!Although I did take liberties.

OMG . . . really awesome! I learned a few things while making this. 4 pears is too many for a 9"" tart. I ended up poaching 3, and only ended up using about 2-1/2 of them (they were delicious, so I just ate the leftovers). There is too much of the frangipane filling as well. I used all of it, and when I placed the pears on top, the pears sunk into the filling (hence not the beautiful presentation that I was hoping for) and while it was baking, the filling went over the edges and onto the baking sheet (good call on having a baking sheet under the tart pan)! I also didn\'t use blanched almonds. I just ground them up in my food processor, which I\'d do again.  The flavor is wonderful though, so I\'d definitely make this one again. Oh, and that poaching liquid - I strained that and have been  using it to sweeten a cup of tea. It\'s just lovely! ']"

It didn‚Äôt taste overwhelmingly like pears, but we both thought:  what do pears actually taste like in any recipe?  Not a strong taste.  We had tons of pears off of our own trees.  I finely chopped then instead of grating.  It was moist and good.  Look forward to seeing how it toasts in the morning.

Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup,"['          I made this exactly as instructed. I make several butternut squash soups, and never add milk or cream to keep the calories down. But I added half and half this time, and it makes a huge difference. It is very creamy and very filling.

Pear Butter,"[""          One spoonful & all of my kids (5 adults) each wanted some!  Normally I like the shorter reviews but I have some information about how mine came out.

I used my immersion blender to blend the butter & although I left the lid off for a couple of hours, it never thickened up.  So I added 2 packages of Knox Unflavored Gelatin & turned out the perfect consistency when cooled.The second batch I did not add the water at the bottom because of the prior results & accidently forgot the orange juice.  I did add the zest near the end but didn't want to add the juice seeing how it all ready had a lot of liquid.  Again, added the unflavored gelatin to thicken it up.  The taste is slightly different but still amazing!  I will make it again next year but I may try using pectin to see the results. "", '          I love the flavor of this recipe and will use it again. I made it to the directions and the only change I will make is next time I will peel and core my pears, I did not care for the mashing and mess with hot fruit.

I used my CrockPot as others had suggested and it worked...BUT when I started to clean the crock, I discovered it had a couple of hairline fractures.  I contacted the company, CrockPot, and was told the pot must be 2/3 to 3/4 full or the heat can buildup and result in cracks in the crock or the lid.  I did take the lid off for the last 2 or 3 hours to allow the moisture to evaporate.  So, just a word of warning to those using a slow cooker.

The only issue I have was once it cooled the orange flavor was obsolete and the cinnamon flavor was powerful. I even decreased my cinnamon and added an extra orange with orange extract so I‚Äôm not sure what happened. I usually make another recipe but this one sounded so good. It is better as far as sweetness. It was a great addition to my sliced turkey sandwich that I had for lunch and it‚Äôs great on oatmeal!  We‚Äôve also used it as jam on our toast and pancakes!

Apple-Cranberry Salad,"['          I thought this salad to be delicious!

', '           We enjoyed this in spite of the fact that the pears I used did not have a ton of flavor.  This would make a really nice party appetizer, cut into small wedges.  From a presentation point of view, the pear slices looked a little dry when this came out of the oven.  Next time I think I\'ll try heating a little bit of apple jelly and brushing it on the fruit before it goes into the oven.  For whatever reason, the crust ended up tough/too chewy...I used a Boboli thin pizza crust.  In the future, I think I\'ll use my own homemade pizza crust.

I had 1/2 bunch of swiss chard to use up so I chopped it finely and threw that in while cooking the chicken. When chicken was browned on both sides, I added in the leftover sauce that I didn't use on the pizza. I had two ripe pears to use up so I peeled those, chopped and threw them in too. Cooked until chicken was almost falling apart, maybe 40 mins. Served it over jasmine rice. YUM! "", '          best. pizza. ever. made. it was amazing! and so easy.

Fruit Leather,"[""          I made some strawberry syrup with some fresh strawberries and didn't want to just throw out the left over strawberry mash and then I saw this recipe.

', '          This is a good recipe, but I use a food mill, and have apple puree, which is great.

This weekend we made strawberry/blackberry mix together, And My kids along with my husband were eating them before I could get them rolled! ', ""          I did this with VERY ripe pears so I used about half the sugar.  I did use my vitamix and it does make it easier.  It's not really necessary to peel the fruit, but you do need to remove the seeds, especially apple seeds as they are pretty toxic.  My 19 month old grandson loved it.  His Mommy liked it too!  At first I was unhappy because I didn't get it super evenly spread, but the edges got a little cripsy while the middle was chewy.  It was two foods in one, fruit leather and fruit chips!  Thanks for the recipe!!! "", ""          I tried this recipe with strawberries and raspberries and it was not good.

It didn't seem to soak in as much as I thought it should.. definitely a keeper but I will use a different glaze recipe next time that doesn't make so much. "", ""          I didn't find this cake troublesome at all - it easily accomplished by a novice cook.   That being said, I wasn't impressed.  I thought with all the positive reviews I would love it, but it's not that spicy and it's WAY too sweet.  It has a very bland flavor profile.  Will not be making it again.  Many other great spice cake recipes out there that are so much better.  A good one to try is  America's Test Kitchen's recipe for Gingerbread Layer Cake (you can make it in a bundt pan easily) - it's WONDERFUL.  Much more complex and flavorful.  Won't help you use up that bag of prunes, but great nonetheless! "", ""          Very similar to my Mom's recipe, which she got from an Italian lady whom my family was great friends with.  In fact I often called her my second Momma growing up.  I make this only once a year so needed a reminder of the spice amounts,  when I couldn't find Mom's recipe this year I came here.

Baby Food: Plum,"['           I have made all of my own baby food for all of our children, this is a great tutorial for new moms wanting to make their own healthy homemade baby food. If the plum mixture is to thin you can thicken it up with some cereal or thin it out with formula, breast milk or the cooking water  (the cooking water has some vitamins & nutrients which get leached out during steaming). As baby gets older  I add in some spices such as; cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, etc. ']"
Easy Plum Cake,"['          When I put the batter in the pan, it was insufficient to cover the bottom of the pan, so I quickly made another recipe of batter to add on top. It took almost twice as long to bake, but was wonderful! 10/10!! Love it! ']"
Tangy Plum Liqueur,"['           Extremely great!!!! I made sure to get the correct vodka amount and follow the recipe perfectly except that I was worried that the fermentation container would bust on its side so I sat it up to relieve pressure. Tastes amazing and I made 4 liters of plum liquor. Can‚Äôt taste the vodka at all but definitely get a nice smooth vanilla-y taste !!! ', '          I made this recipe following the instructions exactly. I also made another batch with less sugar. I did not use wax to seal the jars--I used regular mason jar lids, and I stored the jars in a cool dark place, shaking every week or so to combine ingredients. The results were very good. We enjoyed the lower sugar batch more than the full sugar one. The low sugar liqueur was plummier. I think the syrupy batch would make a good topping for dessert. ', ""          Mine came out on the sweet side.  I'm not sure if this is due to the type of plums I used or the amount of sugar in this recipe.  Guess I'll have to try again next year ;).

It is a major sugar overload.  Almost a cup in the dough, another cup in the filling with the already-sweet plums, and another quarter cup for the crumb topping. It was so insanely sweet I actually had to manually remove the filling and rinse it out to make the pie actually edible. Once I did that I suppose it was okay. I recommend halfing the overall sugar that is called for here, if not also omitting the crumb topping. "", '          Really disappointed. There was so much liquid in the pie after baking that it just fell apart when trying to serve. Maybe I used the wrong plums?! Recipe didn‚Äôt specify and the store only had one kind.

Used an 8 in x 6 in ceramic cake pan instead of a tube pan.  Added 1 Tbsp vanilla instead of lemon zest.  Also, sprinkled sugar on the bottom of the cake pan and on top of the cake before baking.  Turned out perfectly. ', '          As is this tart is tasty at 3 1/2 stars, but the crust needed something.  After making it a second time with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and cardamom and 1 teaspoon vanilla, the flavor was so much better.  The cardamom with the plum was prefect.  I also sliced the plums much thinner and laid them in a rosette around the top. ']"
Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Plum Sauce,"['          its the best i loved it ', '          My cupboards were shy on shallots and balsamic vinegar, so I substituted garlic an white.

Turned out great--great mix of tart and sweet, and great with coffee or milk. "", '           I, too, found that the topping just sat on top and after 35 minutes baking it was still white flour sitting on top.  I poured some melted butter on it and baked another 30 minutes.

Plum Pudding Sauce,"['           4.9.20  Followed the recipe, but I did cut back the sugar because we‚Äôre just not into too sweet these days (that‚Äôs personal taste).  The recipe doesn‚Äôt tell you this, but after you add the flour and vanilla, you need to cook for about another 10 minutes or so low temp to thicken this into a sauce, otherwise you‚Äôll have something that is the consistency of milk. I ended up adding more flour to thicken it a bit.  Also, take a few spoonfuls of the sauce and put it in a small bowl before you add the flour/vanilla.  Add the flour/vanilla, stir it well, and then add back to the sauce,  Otherwise if you add the flour directly to the hot milk-sugar-egg mixture without tempering it, you‚Äôll end up with lumpy sauce.  The flavor is excellent, and I can see this on so many desserts, particularly bread pudding.  We enjoyed a drizzle of it on a slice of apple pie. ', '          The recipe was easy to make.  I was hesitant at first but by the time I started stirring and tasting, even Gordon Ramsey would have complemented me.  Outstanding over my Rum Cake. ', '          Yum, this was perfect!

Cooked in my 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I am making four more this weekend to share with family.  It was a HUGE hit. ', '           I liked it 100% the coffee cake was excellent.

It turned out beautifully.  It was still warm when I cut the first piece and it was soft, almost pudding-like but oh, so tasty.  I covered it and put it in the fridge and hope it will firm up a little.  Even if not, it is still very good.  Next time I will use regular flour which will make it firmer I'm sure.

I greased the pan with Crisco and mixed the butter and brown sugar in a separate bowl and microwaved a tad before spreading it in, so as not to disturb the Crisco coverage.  I used two outer circles of plums, and the middle blueberry.  I also made 5 single lines of blueberries coming out from the center like spokes on a wheel.

Pork with Plum Sauce,"['          Great recipe,  I substituted plum jam (2-3 tablespoons) instead of plums, and only 1 teaspoon of brown sugar.

I think fresh ginger would be a good addition instead of the ground ginger. "", '          I did not like it - the soy sauce was too overpowering.  I made this for 1 person and cooked the sauce only about 10 minutes.  The plums were soft by that point and the sauce was thickened. ', ""          Love to use fruit to flavor meat. Nice to make rather than a sugary jarful.  Used chicken broth, sprayed with Brach's Amino Acids,  no vinegar or brown sugar, 2 whole cloves vs. ground.

Fresh Fruit Frangipane Tart,"['          I was disappointed. It sounded fantastic, and I was eager to try this recipe. It looked beautiful. The puff pastry was spectacular.

Plum Dumplings,"['          I did not intend to make any changes to this recipe, but my dough was crumbly so I added more mashed potato.

Some plums got a double dose of the sugar&spice mixture; by the time they were ready to get wrapped, they'd juiced up so some of the mixture had run out and I topped it up again (oh, the horror!).   And that is the only thing I changed. The pastry worked out and despite some misgivings at when I first started mixing the ingredients together, the texture actually turned out perfectly.

Second batch, cooking time after pit removal = 45 minutes. Jam turned out perfect.', ""          So far sounds perfect- I hate pitting fruit to can.  I do a lemon jam this way, so I'm pretty sure it'll work.  I did put in 2 cinnamon sticks, about a teaspoon of ground cardamom, and a Tablespoon of lemon juice.  Update:  I learned a cool method of pitting and peeling, but jam is too tart, and didn't firm up, stayed a syrup.  Fruit also had a burnt flavor because it cooked so long.  Will be a perfect cobbler filling. "", '          Only had 2.14 lbs so the cardamom was dropped to 7 pods and the sugar to 2 cups. Cooked for about an hour  and made 4 half-pints. Never again will I waste my time or ingredients by fishing for plum seeds in the jam. Cut the plums in half before you begin, remove the seeds, and save yourself a lot of mess, time, and most importantly, fruit. The finished jam is tart and delicious. Will make it any time I can get my hands on Damsons. ']"
Fresh Fruit Cobbler,"['          I‚Äôve been searching for a cobbler recipe for a while and finally found it! ', '           Great starter recipe! Made it with the following revisions: used 10 peaches, 1 c raspberries, 3 c blueberries and 2c blackberries - all fresh. Added 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 flour plus 2 tsp apple pie spice to fruit and mixed well. Tripled the batter recipe and split the fruit and batter between 2 9x9‚Äù pans.

It reminded me of my mother's cobbler, but I wanted some fruit syrup to develop as it cooked.  I think lots of folks are judging against what their mom or grandma made, so a cobbler has a different definition for everyone.  For me, I think the cobbler needs more fruit, at least another 1 1/2 cups.  I believe the extra fruit and about 1/4 cup of sugar, moved from the crust to the fruit, will help some syrup to develop.  At any rate, I'm glad I found this recipe, and I know my family will be quite happy.  In fact, I'll bet the cobbler will be gone, by bedtime!  Thanks for the idea!

Prune Cake,"[""           This cake is tremendously delicious. My family and I love it, and I have made it several times.

I use Sucanat (dehydrated sugar cane) which gives big molasses flavor with less sugar. Also, I added a dash of sea salt, it helps bind the flavors (just a DASH).

After reading the reviews, and respecting mis7up, as a fellow buzzer, I took her advice and added a little extra sugar.  I added an additional 1/4 cup, making my total 3/4 cup.  Butter (all I use) was used in place of margarine.  I decided to bake in 5 mini (6x3 1/2) loaf pans rather than a 13x9 pan. They rose beautifully and were done at the 35 minute mark.  I served this bread with 'Christmas Morning Egg Casserole' from AR.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoys them as bread, but our favorite way to eat them is toasted.

Two important points though: the amount of dough turns out to be enough for a cake amost double the size. As it is in the recipe it would overflow the tray and shed plums to the sides. Also: is it absolutely vital that an amount of milk/water is more precisely specified for the kneading phase. For a non-expert ""as needed"" doesn\'t make any sense, and the level of moisture achieved is critical for a good drozdz√≥wka, because if too dry it\'s miserable.', '          I\'ve been looking for years for a recipe for a cake made with yeast, longing to replicate one we used to get all the time from the bakery in the Polish neighborhood where my father lived. I was so excited when I found this one, but alas, this came out more like a heavy bread than a cake. I think I\'ll try it again someday, using half the flour and double the milk. Also, the instructions say to ""knead in as much air as possible,"" but as a cooking technique, kneading is about pushing air out, not incorporating it in. So I\'m not sure what the author means by that. I think if this were more of a batter it might be a good recipe.

Easy to make and delicious for breakfast or tea time. I had a hard time fitting all the fruit on top. In fact, in the end I had to leave out one peach and one plum. I guess the final amount will depend on the size of your fruit. ']"
Prune Filling,"['          This is a very good prune filling. I did stew dried prunes in apple juice because that‚Äôs what I had. I made fruit filled cookie bars with it and my grandkids loved it, they didn‚Äôt know it was prunes lol! ', ""           I made a half batch of this filling, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also used dried prunes that I stewed in orange juice with some orange zest (so I ended up using orange juice instead of the lime juice called for in the recipe). This filling is slightly spicy, sweet, citrus-y, and definitely prune flavored (which I love!). I'm going to use it to fill paczki's. Thank you for the recipe!

Plum Chipotle Sauce,"['           The neighbors had Italian prune plums and I pitted and pur√©ed them. It‚Äôs delicious, I got four pints out of eight cups of plums.

This is why I gave it 4 stars. So I added anothrr jalapeno and added extra vinegar. I cooked it for at least twice as long because it was too liquidy.  it was still liquidy but it jelled to jam thickness as it sat. I made it again with 1/2 cup less sugar and an extra 1/2 jalapeno and cooking it longer.   ', '          This is ridiculously good.  I did not use the liquid smoke.  I did use the chipotle in adoba.

I can imagine the task of pressing each of those raw through a colander to get juice. I also wanted to make as many jars as possible to can for Christmas gifts. I had to do some math for the conversions that I hope will be helpful to someone else. There are 6 to 8 regular size plums in 1 pound. For my Italian plums, there are 11 to 12. That means 44 plums to 1 quart. For this recipe, that would be 220 small plums. I simply cut them in half to remove the pit and then put them in my food processor. I buzzed 10 at a time and got them as smooth as possible. I repeated this until I had used all the plums and in total, I got 25 cups of. Fruit. You would get 33 cups if you had the 5 quarts the recipe calls for. I increased the vinegar and added a quarter cup of pectin just to make sure that this would can and keep well. I also read reviews about it being a too sweet and knew the vinegar would both help at preserve it and tone down the sweetness. I processed half pints in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and got 32 jars! Already served it with roast pork and then tacos and everyone loved it. I will share pictures and the full ingredients are used: 25 cups pur√©ed plums. 1/4 cup pectin. 4 cups apple cider vinegar. 6 cups sugar. 6 cloves garlic. 2 1/2 Tbs salt. 1 large onion. 1 jalape√±o. 1/4 cup chipotle peppers in adobo. Cooked everything down for an hour and a half at a simmer before canning. ', '          Absolutely love this bbq sauce.  This is my second year making it.  It is a bit difficult to get any juice out of the plums just by squeezing them by hand.  I ended up using a juicer, and my food processor.  I like it a bit chunkier than the recipe is.  And I do recommend using Penzeys chipotle seasoning.  I used about 1/2 of the amount, and it was perfect.  Oh, and skipped the jalepeno as well.  I didnt think it needed it. ', '          First off -- I am not a fan of plums, but this is SOOO good. ', '          Ths is the second year I have made this; it became a staple for us over the winter.

I'd never whipped evaporated milk before and I expected it to thicken more like cream, but it doesn't. It just gets a bit bubbly. But I mixed it in anyway and put it in the fridge and it did thicken!

This cake (kuchen) was absolutely delicious. I used plums off of my tree (I had a huge bumper crop) and I was so glad it turned out as good as it did. I thought it would be too sweet but the plums gave it a delicious tanginess. I0t would be good with ice cream, a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I will definitely be making this again0 ', '          I think this has good potential, but my family did not prefer it. I think the biggest complaint was the skins.  Next time I try it I will check out some of the other reviewers ideas and definitely make sure they are peeled and pureed. ', ""          A great light, fruity dessert for summer. I cooked the plums much longer, removing the skins along the way, and used regular evaporated milk -- no fat means no texture when you whip it. I also chilled the bowl first, just like when you whip cream, to make it as light and airy as possible. Next time, I think I'll cut the lemon juice by half, it doesn't need that extra tartness and I want more of the plum flavor to come through. I may also try reducing some of the plum juice, or even use that instead of water for the gelatine. ""]"
Ponche de Frutas (Fruit Punch),"['          i made as written. and it was way to sweet.

The subtle blending of the multiple flavours work wonderfully together.  I was skeptical about adding the tea, but was pleasently surprised at it's non overpowering presense, instead it brought the taste of the fruit even more to the forefront.  I would reccomend this recipe to anyone looking for a drink to satisfy all.  Plus with it's added attraction of the fresh fruit floating on top, it makes an eye pleasing addition to any table.

Rogaliki (Polish Jam-Filled Crescents),"['          These turned out delicious. Delicious, but not picture perfect. I thought I had a pound and a half  of butter in the fridge. Well no, I had 3 and a half sticks. (Crud!!) So I halved the recipe.  Then I proceeded to add to my confusion by cutting the dough log into 1.5 inch sections. Since I only had half the amount of dough for the recipe I should have cut it into 3 inch sections.  So the dough circles were too small and consequently the triangles were about half the size they should have been. This made them difficult to fill and roll. Oh well! I had bite-size Rogaliki.Besides making them small, the only deviation I made was with the yeast. Even with starting out with the milk at room temperature, after 12 minutes in a nice warm spot it had not even started to proof.  I stirred in about a half teaspoon of white sugar to kick-start the process. It worked. The yeast foamed up within 5 minutes. ', '          loved them! ']"

Plum Buckle,"['          This is a very colorful dessert, but ...1) Pressed for time, I had to skip the sweet crumble topping, but for me, the fruit part was way too tart (this being what happens to sweet, ripe plums when cooked), and needed separate sweetening.2) To be honest, the method of incorporating the ingredients was mystifying to me.  First of all, when did 2/3 c. butter mixed with 1 1/2 cups sugar ever become ""smooth and creamy""? Then, after adding the eggs, how does one ""stir in"" a whole 3 cups of flour? Why not sift the dry ingredients  separately and then add them alternately with the first part of the milk (the usual process with cakes)?This cake does take much longer to bake than most.

The cake will soak up the plum juice quickly, turning it in to a bread pudding. If you don‚Äôt like it like this, reduce the plums to 4 cups or as low as 2 cups finely chopped.

I harvested about 6 pomegranates from my backyard bush within a week of making the jelly. This is the first year I got more than two fruits, so I was excited to make jelly. Unfortunately I only got 1 1/2 cups of clear juice, so I had to scale back the amounts stated by this recipe. I kept the same proportions though. I also used pectin extracted from 3 pounds of crab apples. Another website stated that it was a guesstimate as to how much ""natural pectin"" to use, so I was a little hazy  about using the proper amount. I ended up using 4 ""ice cubes"" of my crab apple pectin (maybe about 6 TB total?). The boiled mixture thickened slightly when I cooled it and poured into my jars. So disappointed I only filled two 8oz. jars! But I can\'t wait to try the jelly...it looks amazingly clear! ', '          I made this using fruit from the tree including fresh lemon juice. I did as suggested and put the pectin in the juice bring it to a boil for 30 seconds prior to adding the sugar.   This set up perfectly every time.

This makes a great gift because it can be used for so many things from holiday dinner to a simple toasted bagel. Yum ', '          We just love Pom jelly. This recipe is good, but I reduced the sugar to 4 cups, doubled the pectin.  PLENTY sweet, can still taste Pom.  Used fresh juice.  We juice ours by tossing a couple cups at a time of fresh kernels in the blender and pulse just a couple times, then strain into the cookpot with doubled cheesecloth or a tea towel. ', ""          This jelly is good but WOW is it sweet. I have to admit when I read the reviews saying to reduce sugar I thought it was just people who don't like sweets, so I made the recipe using the full 7 1/2 cups sugar.  Dang, wow...it should definitely be reduced!  To put this in perspective for you , I literally ate cookie dough for breakfast this morning. I'm not afraid of sugar!  I added extra lemon juice to try and cut the sweetness and it helped a little, next time I'll reduce it by a cup like the suggestions said in the first place.  As other reviewers suggested I added the pectin (powdered) to the juice, boiled and the added sugars and  boiled again, it's jelling fine. Also, a jelly tip to reduce bubbles ( and skimming) add a little bit of butter right before you're ready to fill jars, the bubbles dissipate. ""]"
Lamb Braised in Pomegranate,"['          I made this in a one-pot, using lamb shanks, by braising the meat on brown, then the onions.

The only reason you might not like it is you just don't like lamb.  Made it exactly as written and served with couscous.  One recommendation, buy pomegranate juice, do not try to make it from pomegranates.  It took me an hour and 3 pomegranates to make 2 cups and was not worth it in my estimation.

The vinegar was way too strong. I made the recipe as written, then made a lot of tweaks to get it the right taste for our family. My recommendations: Cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and increase the pomegranate juice to 1-1/2 cups. (I reduced 2 cups pomegranate juice on the stove to about 1 cup reduction in a subsequent attempt at this recipe and liked it even better so you may play with the pomegranate juice.)

Pear and Pomegranate Salad,"[""          I need to learn an easier way to remove the pomegranate seeds.

I used romaine, but I think it would be better with spinach (unfortunately one of our guests can't eat spinach).  My disappointment was with the salad dressing.  It just didn't pack much of a punch.  The mustard in the dressing was a nice touch, but in the end it was a little bland. "", '           I added a bit more mustard to the dressing,  and topped with some feta cheese.

I did add quite a bit of crushed ice which didn‚Äôt dilute the flavor it too badly, used vanilla Greek yogurt and  pomegranate-blueberry juice (both what I had on hand) and was quite happy with the taste.  As I always do with smoothies that have oatmeal, I first ground/pulverized the oats in the blender and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Pretty good, but it does either need frozen blueberries or ice IMO and at least for me, I'll cut the cinnamon in half if I make this again. "", ""          Okay, this was interesting. It was not quite thick like other smoothies I make. It tasted like blueberry yogurt juice. Only changes I made was using frozen blueberries and cutting the amount of sweetener in half and it was plenty. Not a smoothie I would make again, as it was too thin for my taste and I am just not a fan of smoothies with more than a couple of Tablespoons of yogurt.

(or whatever type of liquid you use) and I added 1 pint of fresh raspberries once the relish was finished cooking.  I use the same amt of spices every year because WE LIKE IT ""spicy"".  I also had to make the pomegranate version as well, and NO, the pom seeds are not supposed to ""get soft"" as a couple ppl mentioned that theirs didn\'t. The point of the pom seeds if you use them is that they ADD A CRUNCH to this sauce.  :)  As long as you keep the liquid/cranberries in the same proportion and follow the directions for cooking this, you can do whatever you want with this ""recipe"". Few spices? Fine. Booze for liquid? Try it! Grated citrus zest....yes, please! Added fruits? Sure!  Last year I made some with 1 cup of apple juice and chopped up an apple to add plus stirred in some toasted walnuts at the end. THAT was really good! ', ""          The flavors worked well together.

My whole family loves it, including my kids who look forward to it.  My favorite part of the recipe is the ground cloves and cinnamon.  The spices add so much flavor and smell so good while cooking!

Pomegranate Stew with Chicken (Khoresh Fesenjan),"['          There are 2 types of Fesenjan, sour and sweet. I like the sour one better.

I'll make no changes to this dish the next time I make it, it's perfect as is. "", ""          Amazing flavor and texture. My kids gobble it down. Made a substitution of 1 part cinnamon and 1 part ginger since I couldn't find cardamom in my local grocery store. Making it again tonight for dinner! "", ""          I make this dish whenever I get the chance. Using full pomegranate juice defintely results in a tart end product, but the sugar and spices really work well with it. I generally use drumsticks, but boneless/skinless thighs reduce the work and chicken breast can be cooked with it a little later in the process (so they don't dry out). Sometimes I add a little cinnamon/ground cloves as well. Paired with rice and/or flatbread and some plain yogurt it makes a fantastic meal. Everyone who has tried it has raved and asked for the recipe. Can also be converted to a crockpot cooking method, though the flavors don't seem to come through as well. Leftovers are also very good. Just an all-around winner! "", ""          This was absolutely delicious. I used chicken thighs and substituted 4 whole green cardamom pods for the 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I also added 2 cups of  fresh carrot chunks, which nicely balanced the tartness of the pomegranate juice (instead of using sugar).  The sauce didn't thicken sufficiently for my taste so I boiled it down to the desired thickness. "", ""          I've always loved fesenjan but had no idea it'd be so simple to make. This turned out great! Thank you! "", '          AWESOME!! I make this receipe almost every week. ', '          I substituted two cans of whole chickpeas for the chicken and it came out as a really nice vegetarian meal. ', '          I made this last night.  My sauce did turn out a nice brown color. I used chicken thighs (took the skin off).  I am wondering when reading other\'s reviews if they did not use PURE pomegranate juice? Maybe this is why it was too sweet or an odd color!? Omitted the sugar as well.  It can be confusing because in the Juice shelves of most grocery stores there will be ""Pomegranate Juice 100% Juice"" but it\'s mostly grape juice and other fruit juices!  What I did is get 2 pomegranates and juice them myself, so that was time consuming to do. I had to look up a Youtube video ""How to Juice a Pomegranate""  Anyway, the juice was tart and gave the dish a good flavor. 2 pomegranates = 1.5 C of juice and I did use Organic chicken broth 3/4 C of that.  Great suggestion from others!   I added to my liking in addition to the Cardamom: 1/2 tsp of Tumeric, and I also seeded a small Serrano pepper and tossed that in whole to give the dish some heat.  I liked my additions, it was super good over Indian Basmati Rice!   Another reviewer suggested shredding the chicken off the bone and I did that right in the saucepan after it had been simmering for an hour or so.  It was  unique, very flavorful. I also made the Persian Cucumber Yogurt salad and got some store bought Wood Fired Naan flatbread to go with it.  YUM.  I only gave it 4 stars because the time consuming issue of the pomegranates and not finding the juice in the store, so this recipe might not be very convenient for some people to make. ']"

In a  large deep bowl,  take the pomegranate and pull apart over the bowl.  Take each quarter and place it skin side up in one hand with your fingers open.  In your other hand, take a wooden spoon and whack the skin side of the pomegranate.  The seeds just fall out.  Don't be afraid to hit fairly hard.

Khoresht Fesenjaan (Chicken with Pomegranate Sauce),"['          This came out really tasty, will definitely be making again. I used a whole chicken and baked in a dutch oven.

However, I love trying new foods and was interested in seeing what this would turn out like.  I thought it was interesting although not sure I'm a huge fan.  Hubs was not a fan at all and wanted to know where the other leftovers were.  He ate this but wasn't thrilled.  I'm thinking his dislike stems from the cardamom, which he hasn't really seemed to like in any dish.  I'm also willing to admit this could totally be my fault that we didn't like it--I did leave out the saffron because I'm not interested in using an expensive spice just for the color.  I love saffron for the flavor.  However, I did base that decision on the one review that mentioned it, so perhaps if I'd kept it in we would've enjoyed it more.  Thanks for the recipe!

However, for some reason it didn't work.  I tasted the sauce and it seemed fine before I put it in the oven, but after two hours, it looked and tasted gross.  There was no flavour and I couldn't taste the saffron at all.  I'm pretty sure that I did something wrong, as this recipe is fantastic in Persian restaurants.

This is supposed to be a very difficult Persian dish to make and it was my first time ever making the dish, but the recipe is so straight-forward and easy to follow.

I measured everything out exactly, and for 10 ounces of kale, there wasn't nearly enough dressing. This was a very dry salad. I would double the dressing. I'd also add a touch of sweetness to it, such as raw honey, as the dressing is very tangy.  I felt this could have used some cheese, such as crumbled feta or goat cheese.

This a very sweet bread, I'd classify as dessert.  I think cutting some of the sugar wouldn't hurt it at all.  Four large persimmons netted us 3.5 cups of pulp which we blended in 2 smoothie cups.  Probably would have been 4 cups, but my daughter didn't scrape the skins as well as I did.  I only had larger or smaller loaf pans than specified, so this recipe made two 8 x 4 loaves.

If you're lucky and they do, then you can skip freezing them.I only had enough persimmons for 3/4 recipe. I inadvertantly added the full amount for the rest of the ingredients. I also added a dash of cinnamon and a tiny pinch of cloves. It turned out delicious! I then used the persimmon jam in rugelach .

Spiced Persimmon Butter,"[""          The recipe is great, but there advice by another person reviewing it is somewhat dangerous.

It was a little on the salty side, and even with the toffee bits, they are not sweet enough for me (and my 3yo son spit it out and said it was yucky).  I'm new to persimmons, so I don't have much recipe experience to compare to, but I couldn't taste the flavor of persimmon at all- just the spices (and salt) I added in.

The reason for making this recipe, for me was to try persimmon, I had never used persimmon or had ever tasted one I wanted to learn about them.  I let the persimmon ripe for about a week and when I went to peel the persimmon I noticed it had a feel black spots and then the rest was hard not easy to mash I was not sure if the Persimmon was good or not but I carried on making the muffins.  I didn't read all the steps first before making the muffins and I add all the ingredients in the first step together without mixing before adding the next ingredient.  The first thing I noticed was the big chunks of persimmon and the coconut oil hardening.  but I left them like that I thought maybe the would taste good like that ..After mixing all the ingredients and pouring into prepared muffins cups the batter ended up making 9 muffins I don't know whether this was because of the chunks persimmons but i had to use a  turkey baster to get all the water out of each extra muffin cup until I used up all the batter.

Persimmon Cheesecake,"['          It was hard to get a smooth consistency even with a hand mixer on high.

I disagree with the reviewers who said that it was too runny, or didn't have enough persimmon taste. I didn't strain my persimmon puree at all, and my cheesecake had the perfect, creamy texture and a whole lot of persimmon taste. Since I used a crushed gingersnap cookie crust, I omitted the ginger in the cake and used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead. I also didn't do the sour cream topping. Instead I served it with fresh whipped cream. Awesome cheesecake. Can't wait to serve it to friends.

My kids and husband both said it was better than they thought it would be. Based on the picture, I chose to do one Bundt-shaped bread instead of two loaves (mostly because I thought my kids would be more likely to eat it if it were shaped like a cake). Anyway, I sprinkled some raw sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter, so it had a sweet, crunchy top to it. I really liked the seasonings that make me think of fall/winter holidays. I baked for 1 hour, but probably should have taken it out 5 minutes earlier using the Bundt pan, but still it was was moist and yummy.

I won't be making this again. "", '          So quick and easy and delicious! I thought 1 Tb of cinnamon sounded like a lot, but it was perfect! Smelled divine while it was baking too.

Persimmon Raisin Cookies,"['          I made these and followed one persons review by adding 3  cups of flour instead of four. I also made the persimmon pulp and raisin paste.

Wasn't able to find raisin paste so I hydrated some raisins and chopped them up in a food processor.  I may try one less cup of flour to see if it will make a crisp cookie. "", '           This was a very tasty cookie!  I made a couple of changes out of necessity:  I used raisins vs. raisin paste.   I also substituted 1 Cup of apple sauce for 1 Cup of the persimmons and increased the flour by 1/2 cup to compensate.  The result was a flavorfilled cakey cookie that was perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee!  My husband took a batch to work and told me they were such a hit, the plate was empty within minutes! ', '          They took a lot longer to cook more like 18 to 20 minutes. They came out well, however if I were to make this recipe again I would add the persimmon pulp in with the wet ingredients and then add the dry ingredients. It was extremely difficult to mix up these cookies the way that it is written. I exchanged half of the white sugar with brown sugar and left out the raisins. ', '          fabulous and flavorful ']"

Persimmon Pudding Pie,"['           The texture was perfect as a pudding; I used less sugar at 1 1/2 c. and probably could have used a bit less, since my hachiya persimmons were fully ripe, soft and the pulp was super sweet.

Sandra's Persimmon Pudding,"[""          This is an easy way to create a persimmon pudding.

I had 3 persimmons, so that's what I used, I did not measure them, I just peeled them and stuck them in the blender...I also used 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/4 of skim milk instead of the 1 1/4 c milk it called for...then I added a dash of ground cloves and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked it in a glass pie dish for 40 minutes and it is absolutely delicious and set up perfectly.  I like it a little thicker, so the pie dish worked beautifully for my taste.  I was not expecting such wonderful results since I so loosely followed the directions.  It was a little lighter in color than I remember my grandmothers being, but it was also fluffier - I'm not sure that's the right word because persimmon pudding is by no means fluffy, but regardless, I really like it and I can't wait for my husband to get home and try it.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe - I will make it again and again!  (I also like the fact that there is no liquor in this recipe.

Spicy Persimmon Chutney,"['          Way too much vinegar!!!!  So disappointed. ', '           Made it just as recommended but added a handful of pomegranate.

I will make it again-- but will use for a half batch -- about 1/3 c. and will balance out the remaining liquid with either apple juice or apple juice/water.

With less vinegar, it might be OK at room temperature. ', ""          I quadrupled this recipe so I could can it and give as holiday gifts. Glad the previous reviewers suggested using less vinegar; I used 1/2 of what was called for,  substituting other 1/2 for water.

Also good if added to creamy base (i.e. butternut) and turned into soup. "", ""          Yumdeliciousness! I didn't have some of the ingredients and it still worked great as a basic recipe.  Reduced the amount of vinegar to about 3/4 cup as per previous reviewer's suggestion and it still tasted pretty acidic; I'd keep reducing it even further (the lemon juice also adds acidity!).  I didn't use raisins or chile peppers; instead, put in some cumin and Southwestern seasoning and powdered ginger (a key ingredient in many Indian chutneys).

Sweet Persimmon Fireside Cookies,"['           This has a light persimmon taste and smells wonderful.

I liked the flavor, though it is mild and if I make it again I would try to jazz it up a little more, maybe with nuts, raisins and more spices. I found the dough to be thick, sticky and difficult to work with, so I may not make them again solely for that reason. "", ""          Easy enough but not much flavor.

Banana Chocolate Chip Bread,"[""          This is my go-to for banana bread. I've made this 20 times. This is important- if you don't dust your chocolate chips in flour FIRST, they will ALWAYS sink to the bottom of your pan and collect in a pile on the bottom. Dust them in flour just until they are coated (don't add the leftover dusting flour), and then FOLD them in at the very last minute before you pour it into your loaf pans. Look at the photos and especially the video. All the chips are on the bottom. If you coat the chips in flour, they don't sink to the bottom, and remain more evenly distributed throughout the bread. ps- Please don't tweak the recipe with other ingredients and then give it only 3 stars.

Meaning: Add sugar, flour, salt to the pan and heat at medium heat for a minute or so then add the milk very slowly. Very. Slowly. A little at a time-a quarter cup or less each pour. Whisking throughly and constantly; incorporating fully before adding more milk. I also set the egg yolks out so they‚Äôre room temperature before incorporating. I hope this helps! Fantastic recipe!

I read many of the reviews about a soupy mess and was a little concerned. Well the exact thing also happened to me. it turned out thinner than my pudding with same amount of milk and half the cornstarch. Why?  As a Home Economist, I knew there was a reason. My belief is that it was either over cooked (too high a heat) or under stirred. Custards creams can lose their structure with high heat.  Undercooking and under stirring can also be a problem.  I was working in a different kitchen with a lower quality pot and a new stove. I will try again because my thin custard over broken up graham wafer crust in a bowl topped with whipped cream tasted great! Banana cream pudding.  My guests asked for seconds. I gave it 3 stars for the taste. ']"

The recipe I did not change at all. However, I think it is for jumbo muffins and I used regular. So to my surprise, I had a lot more mix and broke out a second muffin pan and made 18. In doing this I did adjust the cooking time so they wouldn't burn. The prep time (let's be real... 15 minutes is having everything premeasured and in front of you ready to go)  it's more like 30-40 minutes and that's me cleaning as I go - putting dirty things in the dishwasher, not actually washing. I had a cooking time of 16 minutes (I like my muffins on the light and moist side). It was exactly 1 hour from start to finish turning the oven off. Cooling time was additional. I took them out of the muffin tins after 5 minutes so they wouldn't keep cooking. And they were deeelicious!!! "", '          Loved this recipe. Better than anything store bought.

For the past reviewers who had a watery outcome, I experienced this too and I figured out why! I accidentally bought the ""cook and serve"" instant pudding. Since I had already bought all the ingredients and made it this far I decided to heat the mixture to boiling like the pudding box instructions said and then put it in the freezer about 20ish minutes to cool. That thickened it right up! Next I added the cool whip and followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great!

With my changes, it really is  a different recipe, but the original recipe was great as a base and helped me to create delicious muffins without butter (which was the goal - I'm completely out!).-subbed canola oil for 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup melted coconut oil-cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup-subbed coconut milk for oat milk-added chocolate chips (to only half the batter)-omitted cinnamon and nutmegThe muffins rose beautifully and were plenty sweet without the extra sugar (even those without chocolate chips!). I ended up with 12 regular sized muffins and 24 mini muffins. I baked them for about 25 minutes and they were perfect. "", ""          I have been making these muffins for a year now. They are absolutely the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever tried! I don't measure the bananas- usually have about 5 on hand to use, I use the refrigerated coconut milk (not sure if that makes any difference), and I add a couple of handfuls of chopped nuts. It usually makes 2 dozen muffins. When I take them places, I am asked for the recipe! You can also make mini muffins (great for baby showers, etc.)- cook for 18 minutes. Thank you for a fabulous recipe! "", '          So, so good! I did 1 cup total sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), used 3 bananas and subbed the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Also added chopped walnuts. Delish!!! Made about 18 muffins. ', '          New family favorite. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. ', ""          This is a great base recipe, but as others have said it has WAY too much sugar and oil. I used half a cup of rapadura sugar and a teaspoon of stevia, and substituted half a cup of sunflower oil and half a cup of whatever non-dairy milk I had and and they were plenty sweet and moist enough. I also add things like rhubarb, or carob nibs or walnuts.On the issue of bone char, sugar isn't refined this way in Australia so we have no issue regarding whether sugar is vegan or not. I "", '          I did what one other reviewer did and replaced the canola oil with 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup coconut oil. if you do this be sure to melt the oil after you measure it was pretty hard to stir. also ran out of brown sugar so i added about 1tbsp molasses to 1/2 cup white sugar. they took about 26 minutes to bake and i ended up with 20 perfectly baked muffins.

Pineapple and Banana Smoothie,"['          Great recipe! It is delicious. I have had it in the morning as a regular smoothie and have also added vanilla vodka to it for an evening cocktail.

Sarah's Banana Bread Muffins,"['           Good recipe! This was my first time making muffins.

Air Fryer Roasted Bananas,"[""           The best tanks to the best air fryer I've ever wanted. Was never a big fan of air fryers. Until today's times and she's.

The lesson is to not have the parchment paper in the air fryer as it's preheating and only use it to cover the bottom. "", '          These taste really good!! I added a pinch of pink himalayan salt to bring out the sweetness and cooked mine a little longer than 10 minutes.

Banana Chocolate Chip Cookies,"['          IThe cookies were very good. I used gluten free flour and they were delicious ', '          These cookies are amazing!

', '           This is my second batch everyone loves em. ', ""          This recipe was perfect! Unfortunately, I didn't have any chocolate chips but as a substitute folded in some walnuts. Made this recipe both ways so far and tasted just as good üëç "", '           I did not read the reviews 1st (silly me) i did preheat my oven to 400‚Å∞ which I felt was wayyy to high, so i overcooked 1st batch, so i than decided tobputy 2nd batch in 2 minutes less still I found still a bit over cooked not as bad as the 1st batch, so 3rd and 4th batch are now in the oven at 350‚Å∞ for 12 minutes. üëå ', '           I like the chewiness of this cookie!

These small changes should not have resulted in gummy cookies but that's exactly what happened and it was terrible. I like toffee-like cookies, not the risen, gummy type. "", ""          I did what other reviews suggested and added only 1 teaspoon of baking powder and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  When hot, these have a more pronounced banana taste, which mellows as they cool.  However, they became moist in my cookie tin and were unpleasant because of that.  I won't be making these again. "", ""          Someone said 400 degrees was too hot for a cookie so I thought about it while I was creaming my butter. Off the top of my head i thought about Russian tea cakes/Mexican wedding cookies that cook at 400 although I think off the top of my head it's only 9 minutes. I only went through a few reviews and didn't see others having a problem with it so I decided to go with the 400. It worked out fine! Also, I used a silicone baking mat instead of greasing the pan. I also love a variety of different kinds of cookies from shortbread to chocolate crinkle (like a brownie) so a cake like cookie is fine with me but I'm glad i was warned. It is very cake like. I think it would be a great cookie to serve at a family brunch. ""]"

Homemade Banana Pudding,"['          I agree with other posters about not using while eggs.

Banana Pumpkin Bread,"['          This recipe is a great start due to the spice balance.  A few people complained about it not baking properly.  I believe there is too much liquid.  I heeded to the warnings, and I used only 1 cup of pumpkin and brown sugar instead of honey.  It came out great after baking on 400 for 10 minutes, then reducing to 350 for 45 min.

I am constantly trying new recipes to enjoy my pumpkins with and have been trying to find and get what I got here tonight when I slightly modified this recipe by substituting honey with Lakanto Maple Flavored Syrup, and vegetable oil with margarine. Added ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, just a touch of all spice. Doubled the batch one banana shy and cooked in a few different size pans. I just ate half of the smallest one, I have finally after years found and obtained the  outcome I was looking for! ', '          I think vanilla should have been added to pull more flavor out. I agree with others that cook time is off. I think I had it in and out of oven for about an hour and a half. ', ""          Inside is raw and outside is burnt. This makes so much batter I have no idea how they can say to use one loaf pan. I think if decided into 2 it might cook properly... the flavor is pretty bla also although I don't info that it's not super sweet. Anyway, skip this one don't waste your ubf z "", ""          I LOVE this recipe. It's a household staple.I use white wheat, do not add dried fruit or nuts inside the bread, and sprinkle the top with pumpkin seeds and brown sugar. "", ""          Good flavor.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of oil, only one egg, and three bananas.  I'll make this one again!

', ""          Very nice recipe.  I followed the advice to lower temp to 325 and baked for about 65 minutes total.  I didn't have allspice, so used nutmeg and cardamom instead.  Very moist! "", ""          The cook time or something in the recipie is definitely off. I'd read reviews so tried to proactively adjust time and eventually heat but after an hour and a half the top of the bread is burnt while the inside is still gooey. The bread is very dense on the edges where it's actually cooked and it doesn't have a lot of flavor. I added a little cream cheese frosting to the top of the bread that was cooked which added a nice flavor. Overall I'm not a fan I'd recommend using a different recipie. ""]"

There is no need to par boil the peppers, this is in the oven for 60 min. and the peppers are thoroughly cooked during this time.  I made a few changes; reduced the amount of bread crumbs by 1/2 and because I was afraid of them being too hot, I used mild sausage which was just right for us (and we love hot/spicy food).  Also used tomatoes from my garden for the ""crushed"", and tomato sauce for the paste.  It worked out nicely.  I plated the peppers on top of orzo pasta.  We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. ', '          I wish I read reviews I also had double the amount of sausage needed.  Now I find myself trying to find something to cook with the 1 pound of extra hot and sweet sausage mixed with egg, bread crumb and cheese ', '          I too have made this with slight alterations.  As for the extra  filler, I made them into meatballs and added them to the pan, they turned out just fine. ', '          Took me much longer than 30 minutes to put this together, but it was worth it. This recipe is a keeper! ', '          This recipe is fantastic but be CAREFUL with adding the salt. I followed the recipe to the letter, adding 2 1/2 tsp salt without tasting to see if it needed it. It turned out that my cheese, sausages and jarred tomato sauce already provided significant salt, so adding more made my peppers CRAZY SALTY. Even so, my husband loved these and immediately wanted me to make the recipe again for lunch for his employees. I left the added salt out completely for the second batch and it was AMAZING.  I used Cubanelle peppers which are larger and sweeter than banana peppers. They worked great. Parboiling was no big deal to me while I prepped the stuffing. I did like how it made the peppers nice and soft and easy to stuff really full. ']"
Easy Kids' Recipe for Fluffy Banana Cookies,"['           Good starter recipe for muffin top cookies. A good use for blackening bananas too.  I added blueberries.

Porridge,"[""          I changed substituted the water wth milk, used brown sugar instead of white, and used apples instead of bananas.

The salt very nearly RUINED my porridge but I managed to make it palatable by adding heaps more sugar. In short, this recipe should be: 1 part oats to 2.5 parts water plus any flavouring you want. Heat and mix. "", ""          I made it and it was sooooo good! Instead of white sugar, however, I used stevia. Stevia is not only healthier, but more powerful, so it really gave it the bang it was missing. I'll def make this dish again. "", '           Turned out so well! :) thank you for sharing! ']"
Brown Sugar Banana Bread,"['          Loved it! I added chocolate chips. It was so good. ', '          My go to banana bread recipe! Taste amazing and it‚Äôs also very forgiving/versatile. Depending on how many bananas I have, I just go based on that (3-5 any size) and it comes out fine. I also add pinch of nutmeg and use dark brown sugar instead of light for a deeper flavour. I do find with my oven it may take longer than the required time though, so I make muffins instead for a shorter bake (17-20 min).

It was especially good heated up. The bread was pretty dense and moist, but very delicious, and the crust was soft and sticky. I would say maybe add some more spices, and maybe even more cinnamon. I think nutmeg might be a good addition. Very yummy, and was popular with my friends. It's good to use overripe bananas, and also I did not do the plastic bag mashing method I just put them in the bowl with all the other stuff and mashed them in there with a fork, and it turned out fine. I didn't want to waste the plastic. This might only work if the bananas are really overripe though. I also do not have an electric mixer, but it worked perfectly fine by hand. "", '           Enjoyed making this banana bread with my 11 year old daughter. The house smelled amazing! ', '          No changes.  Excellent! ', '          The flavor is good, but ‚Äú4 bananas‚Äù leads to a very inconsistent end product!  (Some bananas are nearly twice the size of others.). Also, I have no idea who is able to bake this for only 40 minutes!  At 40 minutes, the center portion of the bread was still visibly sticky!  Even after 50 minutes, the center was still not done but the ends were almost overly done.  I ended up turning the oven down to 250 degrees and leaving it in for 10 MORE minutes. The center was finally done, but the ends were over cooked so they got thrown away. Making muffins out of this recipe worked much better, but I just kept checking them and didn‚Äôt write down the total cooking time.  Next time I will just use a different recipe. ']"

Clean Banana Oat Cookies,"[""          This is a pretty simple breakfast cookie, and they tasted really nice. But I tried to halve the recipe and I added 3tsp of allulose. So i cheated.

You can tell as you're putting them on the pan that they're going to be in the shape you put them in and not going to rise, so I flattened them into a cookie shape and they came out perfectly shaped.

I then let it cook slightly longer partially covered.  This recipe made 6-8 oz/half pint jars of jam. ', ""          This jam is Delicious!  When you finish boiling the jam, a taste test will seem too sweet.  It quickly mellows once the jam cools.  Using tart apples (Granny Smith or fall Macintosh) will also reduce the sweetness.

I must admit that you have let it boil and stir for a long time but it's worth it. "", ""          This recipe is great if you interpret it correctly.  For every 3 cups of mashed kiwi you need to add 4 cups of sugar, 1/2 lemon, 3/4 pineapple juice and 3 apples ( I used nine apples for the whole batch, 2 lemons and just one serving of pinapple juice because I was worried it would be runny( but- it's a bit thick) .

"", '          Delicious! 13 kiwis made just about 3 cups mashed. Added a little pineapple to make up the difference. Used an immersion blender before ladling into jars to blend the apple peels. Not too sweet, just right! I certainly hope to make this one again. ', ""          I made kiwi jam and sent my dad who lives in the south a jar.  He called and said, honey, this looks like frogs eggs in pond scum.  Now, that's the name of my kiwi jam!  Love it!  MP in Chico. "", '          My jam came out perfect.  It was firm and held it\'s shape when I scooped it out of the jar and I didn\'t change anything except the temp and how long you cook it. Oh and be sure you use a really firm or tart apple like a Granny Smith, which has more natural pectin. The recipe says to lower heat and ""simmer""... don\'t do this!  Heat it to a roiling boil and let it cook at that high temperature, stirring frequently until done... It was delicious! ']"
Kiwi Banana Apple Smoothie,"['           Creamy and delicious.

I could‚Äôve put more fruit on it and it would‚Äôve looked a bit better. I only had a 14‚Äù pizza pan so I added another 4 oz of cream cheese a dash more sugar and vanilla.

Poblano and Ground Pork Tacos,"['          This was delicious! I cooked the onions separate just because my husband doesn‚Äôt like onions. So easy to make.

We're not fans of the creama, so I substituted with a homemade queso fresco and cilantro dip instead.   The important point is that the basic taco filling is a very good one and it is capable of being personalized with the salsas and accompaniments of your choice.

Kiwi-Lime Pork Ribs,"['          thought it would be spicier.. next time I will use s bit more kiwi and lime juice.. ', ""          It was very easy and had a wonderful taste.

The first one was instead of the three pounds of ribs I used 1.5 pounds of left over rib meat. The next was I didn‚Äôt have chili powder so I subbed in Chinese Five spice. If you have never used it you need to buy it. Lastly instead of minced garlic I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.

An unexpected flavor combination on pork, but it works! ', '          I heeded the comments from others about the amount salt and cut it back dramatically.

Note that the sauce is very forgiving.  On short notice I used peaches instead of kiwis and lemon juice instead of lime, and still got rave reviews from the family.  Also used cayenne to make up for a slight deficiency in the chili powder. Next time I'll go with the lime juice and, as others have said, halve the salt.  I think pitted cherries or apricots would also work instead of kiwis.  Would appreciate any hints on reducing the sugar, perhaps substituting Splenda, to make it more diabetic friendly. ""]"
Caribbean Health Drink,"[""          Excellent and filling! But I think liquid was not put on the list of ingredients.

Spicy Fruit Salsa,"['          I actually enjoyed the heat. Rather than using as a salsa pureed it as a sauce over al pastor quesadillas. Awesome!

Since the other reviews noted that this is super spicy, I cut the cayenne and habanero sauce both in half, and it was still plenty spicy. I also added a teaspoon of salt, and I think it needs a little more of a zesty lime flavor - like maybe some grated lime peel or something along the lines of the lime chips.

I paired this with homemade cinnamon tortilla chips. It makes a great pic nic item. Yum! ', ""          I made this for a 4th of July party. Instead of the black berries I used blueberries. Not only did it make the recipe red white and blue, they were alot cheaper than the blackberries because they were in season.

I did not add all the ""liquid ingredients"" (jelly, green salsa, hot sauce) to avoid the salsa being ""too runny"".

White Sangria with Kiwi,"['          Yummy!! ', ""          This sangria is very light, refreshing and delicious.  I especially like that, unlike many other sangria recipes, it doesn''t include brandy, which in my opinion weights it down and takes away from the lovely fruitiness.  But that is our personal preference.  A very versatile and adaptable recipe. "", '          instead of diluting your drink with ice cubes....i froze the green grapes and used them.  this is an easy and awesome summer time drink and refreshing. ', '          Fantastic!!! Easy to make..taste good..we liked this;-) ', '          Adding 1/2 cup of brandy scant 3 tablespoons, but I also added the 3 tablespoons of Grand Marnier.', ""           I liked this, but was looking for a little more of the orange liqueur flavor, so I did bump up the Gran Marnier a little.  I really prefer the more traditional white sangria with brandy (but that's just a personal taste preference).  Realized after taking the photo that I forgot to add the pear, but I added it later along with a few blueberries.  This made it even more of a refreshing summer drink with a fruit salad on the bottom :-)     Thanks Monica Joy for a nice summer drink for a BBQ. ""]"
Strawberry Kiwi Tartlets,"['          This was good recipe but when I was making it we couldn‚Äôt find the correct puff pastry and so we made it with puff pastry sheets. It came out good anyway. It was sweet and tart and the whipped cream added extra flavor and it was very nice alltogether. ', '          Delicious! my only suggestion would be that when you blenderize the kiwis with honey, puree the kiwis first, THEN put the honey in.  i put the honey in first, and it all sunk to the bottom of the processor.

Then used a tub of  Fat Free cool whip with 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the topping.    I got rave reviews but I will try again.    ', ""          Good solid dessert.  I didn't think the kiwi/honey combo was as good as plain kiwi would have been.  Also a little messy/tough to eat.  Overall the taste was good. I added a bit more sugar to the whip cream and doubled the amount of whip cream suggested in order to have enough whip cream for all six that I made.  In short, good, but I'll probably try a few other strawberry desserts before returning to this one. "", '          These were great and really easy to make.  I did everything according to the recipe, but the kiwis at our local market looked really bad, so I used mangoes instead.  I brought them to a get together and they were gone right off!

Then again it was very good and I plan on making it again sometime! ', ""           I didn't take the seeds out of the kiwis... how do you even do that?  Being new to puff pastry, I didn't let it rise enough so it was doughy and not big enough to fit all of the strawberry filling.  All in all, it was a good recipe and I might try it again.

LaWanna's Mango Salsa on Tilapia Fillets,"['          I loved the flavours in the salsa mix!  I did not use the rice as a bed, only the salsa for the tilapia bed.

With all the lovely fresh veggies around this was a great way getting hubby to eat fish (that isn't fried) because he loves pineapplel and mango.   The fish was pretty plain so I added some smoked paprika before I grilled it.  As for the salsa - I liked the balsamic in the salsa - hubby did not care for it.  I think he thought it would have a terriyaki flavor with the pineapple and mango.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe. ""]"
A Drama Queen's Pavlova,"['          I‚Äôve made this multiple times because family and friends request it!

I agree the cream should not be sweetened as the combination is perfect: sweet meringue, lovely cream and sweet/tangy fruit. I use a combination of berries, kiwi and mango. My whole family loves this. We had not tried this dessert before I found this recipe but now it's a favorite! (I skip the coconut and almond due to allergies, but I'm sure they would be marvelous additions) Thanks for sharing this, I'm not a huge sweets person but this is in my top 3!

My mom hates anything with coconut in it and she realy liked this. ', '          Great recipe!  Great texture! New and unique (in the US at least!) It is an easy recipe that puts to use leftover egg whites!  I like to make this after I have made eggnog (recipe from this site) or traditional vanilla pudding (recipe also from this site).  You could make it any flavor I believe.  I add amaretto liquor to mine to make it almond flavor. ', '           This was a HIT with my family and friends!!  I made this for a summer treat and quickly found out that I have to make more than just one each time I make it! My kids can eat an entire Pavlova by themselves (a 3 and 6 year old)!  We love this recipe and everyone in the family now has a copy of it!  Thanks for sharing :) ', ""          Not bad, I am an Aussie that lives in the US.  Pavlova is probably my favorite dessert. I think my Mom makes one of the best Pav's around.  I LOVE passionfruit and it is the real/traditional topping for Pavlova.  Passionfruit makes this dessert, it is not the same without it; in fact it would just be a meringue topped with fruit.  I LOVE PASSIONFRUIT, and that's how REAL Aussie's make it. ""]"
Creamy Kiwi Sandwich,"['          I added a bit more honey and lemon zest for more tang! ', '          This was delicious! I used lemon juice instead of lemon zest and did not refrigerate over night, but it turned out great. This is one of my new favorites for a quick, tasty breakfast. ', '          Wow! Very good. What a unique way to eat a kiwi! I just had to try this as I had one kiwi left and all the other ingredients on hand.  I just eyeballed every thing and didn\'t bother to let the ingredients ""develop"" for a day. Who can wait that long? I could only wait long enough to lightly toast my bread..... ', ""          My kids thought this was great. They've been on this whole kiwi kick for almost two weeks now, so this was a great way to use up more. I didn't chop the kiwi fruit, I just sliced it like I would for a tomato sandwich. I also didn't have time to refrigerate the spread. This was a great way to use up ingredients I always have on hand and clear out the fridge before grocery day. Thanks. "", ""           I REALLY enjoyed this sandwich! I made it on a whim, so I didn't have time to let the cream cheese mixture refrigerate overnight, but it sure was tasty. I just eye-balled everything to taste, and used dried lemon peel and whipped cream cheese for easier mixing/spreading. I served this on lightly toasted Italian-style sliced bread. This was also a big hit with my little guy. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :) "", ""          This was really yummy.  I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I used lemon curd and skipped the honey.  Such a different idea, but one that we loved.

Char Siu (Chinese Barbeque Pork),"['           Very delicious. This recipe will work with any pork. I will do this recipe wit boneless pork ribs and pork ribeyes ', '           I made exactly as the recipe specified with the exception of marinating 24 hours instead of 2 days.

Strawberry-Kiwi Slush,"['           Hard to believe it\'s 97 degrees F on the back porch this early in May.  I\'m ready for something to cool me down, and this did the trick.  I was expecting something a bit ""fruitier"" tasting, so next time I\'ll just eliminate the water; as the ice melts, diluting the fruit flavor will happen naturally.  Hubs thought it was a little tart, so I\'ll try cutting the lemon juice in half next time (admittedly, all of this is personal taste preference).  This was very refreshing, and you don\'t need to worry about calories and fat (which is often the case with smoothies), so you can sip without guilt!  GoodCook, thanks for a great afternoon snack!

Lemon Pretzel Salad with Mango and Kiwi,"['          Really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I would make a few adjustments.  First of all, 3/4 cup butter is waaaay too much!  I would cut down to about 1/4 cup; do 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon juice in the Jell-o; omit kiwi and add more mango (Kiwi reacts funny in Jell-o and it was a little runny); and I think it would be good even with a pineapple Jell-o and maybe some coconut in the crust even! ', '          Still one of my favorite recipes to make.  In high demand in my household, regardless of the season. I still can‚Äôt get the kiwi right, but that‚Äôs me, not the recipe ', ""          Weirdly good.  It was a lot of work for a novelty salad, but everyone enjoyed it, I had no leftovers, and several folks asked for the recipe.  Maybe it just seemed like a lot of work, after all.  The flavors were nice and balanced; I'll make this one again.  Thank you for submitting the recipe. "", ""           I really enjoyed this! It was a lot of work, though. I used a springform pan, so I cut the amounts slightly. I ground pretzels in the food processor (about 1 3/4 c. total). I used 2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp brown sugar, and only 6 Tbsp butter (but probably could've used a full half cup). While the crust baked, I rinsed out the food processor and used it to blend the cream cheese and sugar, then lemon juice and vanilla. Transferred to a bowl and stirred in the lemon zest. I'm not a fan of Cool-Whip, so I whipped 6 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the cream cheese. Delicious! It was just the right sweetness (even with unsweetened whipped cream), with a great lemon flavor. [I only used 3/4 c cream because I wanted to be sure the filling was firm enough to slice.] While the filling chilled, I BLANCHED THE KIWI. The gelatin won't set otherwise. I peeled and sliced the kiwi, placed slices in a strainer, and lowered it into boiling water. Blanched it for about 45 seconds, transferred the strainer to an ice water bath, and then set kiwi slices aside with the mango. For the gelatin, I used the ice water bath from blanching the kiwi to chill the gelatin mixture until it was ready to pour on the fruit. My verdict? I thought the lemon Jell-O detracted from the rest of the dessert. Next time, I'd play with using fruit juice (mango, or passionfruit) and use 1 pack unsweetened gelatin. Just enough to make a shiny, fruity glaze‚Äînot so much for a floating gelatin layer. But I will try this again! ""]"
Simple Strawberry Salsa,"['          I\'ve made Strawberry Salsa many times over the years and also serve with cinnamon chips for dipping. Agree with previous post, I use fresh pineapple so no need for adding white sugar especially if using in season Strawberries.

', ""           Breakfast today was this salsa served with cinnamon-sugar baked tortilla chips.  If you need a recipe for the tortilla chips, see Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips on this site.

But now I want to buy kiwi and try it again - can‚Äôt wait! ', ""          It's delicious and unique. I put it in the fridge and eat it cold.

I added a small number of blackberries that needed to be used up& tried lo-cal bacon crumbles on it. Both worked well. It took longer than 5minutes for the kale to be as wilted as I desired but it was still a quick dish to make. ', '          Man, this was good. ', ""          wow, this was surprising. I really didn't think it would be good at all but I'm glad I tried it because I never would have thought of this combo and it's awesome! a nice alternative to the standard vinegar and soy sauce style of preparing kale. I could also see this working well with citrus like grapefruit instead of kiwi. lots of potential here. "", '          Yummy! I love the flavor combo of these powerhouse foods together. The only thing I did different was to use KerryGold grass fed butter instead of coconut oil because I was out. The tanginess of the kiwi really complimented the ginger and garlic. This one is a winner. ', ""           This recipe looked so interesting I just had to try it.  I doubled the ingredients (for four servings) and made it as written except for using curly kale and substituted 1 tbsp dried oregano for the fresh. Sorry, but nobody in my family including myself cared for it. The oregano was especially overpowering, and the kiwi tasted like very sour lemon. If I ever make this again I think I'd cut the oregano way down and use only half (or less) of the kiwi called for. ""]"

Sweet Salsa and Cinnamon Chips,"[""          Wow! This is definitely very refreshing and not to mention a wonderful combination of colors and flavors. No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine and used fresh strawberries. Baking the chips keeps this a little healthier and lower in fat. So, for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes.

I did 1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon, and still had some left using half. This recipe and others do not say what type of cooking spray to use. I believe I bought the wrong one. Mine was more like a butter than a spray and my chips were kind of soggy! I think it means a cooking spray like Pam. I do not like kiwi, so I left that out, but added some chopped strawberries, but think the peach idea would have been better.

Mango Jam,"['          I got the tip from one of the reviews. Added lemon and lemon zest. So fruity indeed! ', ""          Quick and easy recipe everyone seemed to enjoy. It's a do-again! "", ""          I frequently make jam and can it (my family hasn't purchased jam in a decade). I used mangos that were probably more ripe than the author intended. I had 5 large mangos to mix with the syrup. I used a stick blender to mostly puree the mangos, leaving a couple of chunks for texture. I added the juice of half a lemon and the sliced peel (not the pulp) for added pectin and thickening power. I boiled all of that for about 30 min to get to soft jam consistency. The lemon helped to balance the sweetness and the added acid will help prevent spoilage. In the future, I would use a whole lemon and its peel. If you slice the peel thinly, it will break down nicely in the jam. "", '          Great recipe.

I‚Äôm not sure if I had too much mango pulp or not enough pulp because I had no clue as to weight. Most kitchens don‚Äôt have a scale to measure 2 lbs of mangoes so I had to guess. Cups of mango chunks, pur√©e would have been helpful vs. as written.

Healthy Fish Tacos with Mango Salsa,"['          This salsa is AMAZINGLY tasty.  I substituted the ACV with Balsalmic Vinegar only because I was out.

The only change I made for the salsa was to cut the brown sugar in half, and it was perfect. The seasoning for the fish didn't sound very good to me, so I used homemade fajita seasoning instead. The cooking method was perfect. I didn't serve as a taco, but just put the salsa over the fish. I will make this again! "", '          The mango salsa is the star of the dish.

Creamy Mango Smoothie,"[""          I just made this,followed directions and all. If you don't blend the ice/mangoes together, and put all ingredients in and THEN blend? It's hard to blend everything,so.....1st,I'd recommend blending mangoes and ice (don't overblend!!), THEN finish blending all rest of ingredients. You have to put mangoes,ice,yogurt( this order- it will blend better!!) And then rest of ingredients. Stir after and enjoy! "", ""          This was really really good! The first time I made it, I used fresh mangoes. It was good, it just had a LOT of pulp in it. If you like pulp, maybe that's not such a big deal, but I was kinda off-put by the texture. I then read all the comments telling me to use frozen mangoes instead of fresh. I made it again using frozen mangoes and I can confirm, it was a million percent better. Tho, if you're going to go that route, I would add the frozen mangoes and ice cubes a little bit at a time, then blend it, then add some more and repeat. I put all the frozen mangoes in at once (I doubled the recipe btw), and my blender couldn't chop all of them. On my first batch, I still had chunks of frozen mango in there. Overall I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely make it again throughout the summer! "", ""          We love this smoothie. When making this decadent drink, I always double the recipe when using frozen mangoes and I omit the ice cubes. When using fresh mangoes,  I don't double the recipe because I have to use 5 small mangoes for the original recipe!

I like sweet so will add some honey next time overall simple and delicious. ', '          Just what I was looking for.  I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of apple juice.

Messy ', '          I used 1/2 & 1/2, vanilla, and mango and when I tasted it I actually yelled ""Wow!"" it was so good. Definitely going to be running the stores out of mangoes.

Easy Mango Cake,"['          Me and my mom made this cake for my brothers birthday! He and everyone else that tried it loved it!!

So in the end, we tapered with the recipe but if you want this amazingly moist and delicious cake.... USE THIS RECIPE!!!

The cake to me didn't seem to taste much different from a regular yellow cake besides being a little more  dense from the mango. The glaze was the best part. I only used a little under 1/2 Tablespoon of rum and that was more than enough. I surprisingly wasn't so crazy about the cake but everyone who had a piece absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it again already.

I had none, juice that is. So I wound up squeezing the juice of 1 lime, adding the melted butter and omitting the rum. I didn't measure the powdered sugar, I just added a little at a time until it reached the consistency of a glaze. I liked the tartness of the glaze but I found it over powered the subtle taste of the mango. I will make this again but I will make sure that I have 2 ripe mangos, 1 for the cake and 1 for the glaze. "", ""           Nice cake... a few issues. My mango didn't have any juice to separate for glaze, so I put it in a fine mesh strainer to get that. No big deal, but just be aware this might happen. Th big issue I had was the glaze. I was takeing this to church where kids were so I didnt know how well the small amount of rum taste would go over with them, so I subbed that with an extra T of lime juice. Problem.. this still no where near a glaze.. was a dried powder with lumps. I had no more fresh lime but did have a bottle of lime juice in the fridge.. so I started adding.. more and more to get a glaze. It was very strong flavored as  result, but when eaten with the cake was quite good. Next time I make this.. I will use less sugar and instead of all the lime juice, I'd use water or even coconut water would be nice. The adults liked this and with the tartness of my glaze I would say it was more suited for grownup tastes. For kids, watch the amount of lime juice if you need to thin this out.. which I did ""]"

Even with adding orange and almond extract it was on the bland side. since i didn;t have slivered almonds, I mixed almond flour with a little sugar to make a streusel-like crumb topping, it helps the flavor. But it is a nice moist, dense cake. ', ""          Easy recipe but took way longer to bake. Knowing that , I'd have dropped oven temp a bit as it browned too quickly.

I used a fresh mango instead of the juices.  added a honey glaze to top it off.  I will continue to make this as my wife is a very big mango fan!!!! ', '          I made this the first time exactly as instructed and found it moist but dense (butter/margarine was not creamed into sugar or mixture ).  I made it the second time creaming the sugar and butter/marg first, then adding one egg at a time and mixing well between eggs,  then adding the mango pulp with  one mashed mango and a few dashes of cinnamon (because I had a mango on hand) added to pulp to equal  1 and 3/4 cup and adding the flour ingredients (sifted well together)  last until just combined which is normally how a cake or loaf is done and found it to be far superior than the first instruction on this site.  Now it has a four star rating and with cinnamon whipped cream (ice cream or frozen yogurt) it was five stars.  I also want to try this again with a mango sauce of some sort to enhance the mango flavor and a bit of almond flavoring in batter to enhance the almonds on top. ', ""           08-03-16 ~ A nice cake that we liked, but our neighbors loved it. It is moist with a light flavor. I couldn't find canned sweetened mango pulp, so I made my own. (3 mangos, 2 TB powered sugar, 1/4 cup milk - put all in blender until smooth). The sauce was incredible. Before serving, we poured the leftover sauce over the cake. The cake did go to an all new level of taste appeal. ""]"

"", '           By far this is the  best jam I‚Äôve made. I doubled the recipe with a combination of both green and ripe Hayden mangoes from Belize.  I added 1/2 cup lime juice  and threw in the squeezed limes  for extra pectin while the jam was cooking .  I added small diced pineapples and mangoes.

Easy Fish Tacos with Mango-Pineapple Slaw,"['          So, I needed a quick recipe for fish tacos and found this one which seemed fairly quick and easy. I had beer battered fish fillets on hand and squeezed the lemon juice on them before putting them in the air fryer for 8-10 minutes. While those were cooking, I mixed up the dressing, however I only had apple cider vinegar so I used that instead of the red wine vinegar. I had a full container of mango salsa from Aldi that had pretty much all of the ingredients called for in this recipe, so I dumped that in with a bag of sliced cabbage and mixed it all together with the dressing, which all seemed to be in the perfect proportions. I didn‚Äôt have time to let this marinate, so it was a bit tangy, but for dinner in a pinch, I think it tasted fine. I served the air fried fish fillets and slaw on white corn tortillas topped with cilantro and a squeeze of lime, and got compliments on the meal from my husband and older kids and my daughter thanked me for making such a ‚Äúyummy dinner‚Äù. I realize I made quite a few modifications, but I think my ingredients were still close enough to the original to write a review and thought it might be helpful to anyone else who may need/want to sub certain things as I did. I gave it 5 stars because I didn‚Äôt think it was fair to give any less if I didn‚Äôt follow the recipe exactly, but with my substitutions I would give it a 4/5 and will probably make this quick, easy, and tasty recipe again :) ', '          This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I made it just as written and I highly recommend you make the slaw in advance so all the ingredients can meld. I think people complaining of too much sugar, salt or vinegar did not let it sit in the frig for a while (which is important for any coleslaw).  I used a bag of slaw.  Excellent easy dinner!! ', '          Too much black pepper!! ', '          They were amazing!! I maybe got lucky and got mix right but on a day when it was 91 degrees outside it was a nice light meal with cool fruit and it was a great way to finish off the Alaskan cod I had made the day before.. we will be making this again! Thank you for the share ', '          A bit too much pepper for us, I did not add jalape√±os, but the fruit and fish was great, I almost doubled the fruit and we really liked it.

Jerk Chicken Egg Rolls with Mango-Habanero Sauce,"['          Amazing ! The Mango sauce was my favorite part! I will cook the inside and add rice on the side to make a main dish.

Coconut-Lime Cheesecake with Mango Coulis,"['          Flavors did not really meld ', '           Tasted amazing!

I made one slight change and made pineapple coulis simply because I couldn't find any mango.  It paired with the cheesecake and coconut whipped cream amazingly well.   I will be making this again and again every time I want to be transported back to the islands. "", ""          This is a fabulous, fresh, and different dessert! Just perfect for a warm weather treat. For those hung up on debating whether or not it's a legit 'cheesecake' or not, please unknot your panties and just enjoy it. What does it matter?? Good grief. I followed the recipe to the letter and the result was just lovely. Of course, I'm an experienced baker and cook. If your results are inferior, don't worry! Just keep trying! Because inexperience which produces inferior results will fade over time, as experience level rises ;) "", '          My husband specifically asks for Cheesecake on his birthday. It happens overnight and came out so perfect! ', ""          I made a few changes after reading the reviews.  Made the filling 1 1/2 times to increase the volume, tinted the lime layer with 1 drop of coloring, added a bit more zest and juice to increase the lime flavor and more coconut extract into the other layer.  I also made coconut whipped cream, toasted coconut and lime zest for the topping.  This was not a pretty dessert however, the hint of green in the first layer, mixed with it's natural color, made it look like a dirty scrambled egg cake when you cut into it.  Even with my changes, I also have to agree that the flavor was weak throughout.  I wanted more tropical flavor than what I got. "", ""          After reading some complaints about thickness of the cheesecake,  I've doubled filling amount.  In 9 inch springform total thickness after baking is 1.5 inches.  I've followed the recipe and added water bath -  cheesecake turned out beautifully,  no cracking. It has creamy consistency,  not dense like New York style cheesecake. Overall,  I'm very pleased.

Mango Topping,"['          Absolutely love it. Gave some away as a gift in nice jars. Thankyou ', '          I made this just as it is & it was delish. ', '           This recipe was so easy!  One thing I did to make sure it was nice and creamy was to put it in my blender on low for just a few seconds. It pur√©ed it nicely. I also added a bit more brown sugar as it was pretty tart and I‚Äôm using as a dessert topping for guests tonight. I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why to lady who said she needed to add more water to reduce the mangoes had to do so. Mangoes have a good deal of natural juice, so adding more water would have made it soupy. I mashed the chunks of mangoes on the bottom of the sauce pan to help smooth it out while it was cooking. A good thing to do. I followed the ingredients exactly except for the brown sugar, and it turned out perfectly. ', ""          Quick and easy and tased good on pancakes.  I used frozen mango which worked fine but was more difficult to mash, will  cook longer next time.  I put in pan with water and cooked on low until thawed then added other ingredients.  May add more water next time as there wasn't much liquid sauce. "", '          I did not make any changes to this recipe. I will definitely make again. ', ""           This was a pleasant fruit sauce that wasn't very sweet to go with  my sweeter cakes.  I used the yellow skinned mangoes which isn't as stong flavoured/fragrant as the red/green skinned ones.  So I adjusted the tartness  to my taste and added a pinch of salt to bring out the flavour.  I did use a little cornstarch and water mixture to thicken the sauce more. "", '          This was a great way to quickly use up the mangoes that were getting away from me. A dollop of this, some fresh mango, fresh whipped cream, and angel food cake made for a great dessert! ', '          Great way to use up mangos that are getting too ripe. My sauce was a little thick when I went to use it so I just added a tiny bit of rum. I liked the result. Be warned if the mngos are truly ripe, this is very sweet. You could probably cut down on the sugar. ', ""          Tasty!  I used twice as much brown sugar, twice as much OJ and probably an extra T of water.  It was quite thick without that.  Used it on Seth's pancakes to make them soft enough after surgery. ""]"
Mango Cherry Smoothie,"['          yummy ', '          I added almond milk instead of regular milk. I definitely use this recipe everyday ', '          Instead of water an ice cubes I used frozen cherries and mangos and some unsweetened almond milk and unsweetened flaxseed milk with just enough water to get the consistency I wanted.', '          I only had frozen fruit. No ice and added water until the right consistency. If I had fresh, ripe mangoes this would be even better. ', '           I found this recipe to be very thick and I had to add more liquid just to blend it. With that said, I used coconut water with aloe vera instead of water and added nearly 2 cups and my smoothie was still on the thick side. I also added the juice from half of a lime and sprinkles unsweetened coconut on top. ', ""          Nice, simple, fruity drink.  Very refreshing on a warm day.  I had some very ripe mango, and since I used frozen cherries (I always have those on hand), I omitted the ice.  I also added a dash of vanilla and after tasting, I added a squeeze of fresh lime.  I used less water...maybe half a cup or so.  Perfection, but since I like to play around with my food, I'll probably also add a slice of fresh ginger the next time...and there'll be a next time.  :)  This is perfect for frozen mangoes and cherries, too, and I keep my freezer stocked with those.  A new summer fave! "", '          Really good!  I got tired of pitting cherries so I had more mangoes than cherries. ', ""           The nutritional breakdown on its own is enough for most of us to try this one.  I used frozen mango, so I did reduce the ice a little, and since I like smoothies a little on the thick side, reduced the water as well.  I must admit that I've developed a taste for smoothies with a little Greek yogurt, so as a personal taste preference, I will add about 1/3 cup vanilla Greek yogurt next time.  However, this is simply pure sweet fruitiness from a combination of perfectly-ripe summer fruit, and it gives you a real pop of vibrant flavor.  Very nice. ""]"
Macadamia-Crusted Sea Bass with Mango Cream Sauce,"['          I didn‚Äôt make the cream sauce because I made a pineapple mango salsa instead.

Cod was on sale so I bought it!!  Chopped up the macadamia nuts and panko but left it chunky because that's how we like it.. Garlic powder, black pepper and parsley and mixed it all up in a ziplock..

I followed the recipe except for adding a dash of Asian chili paste to the mango sauce and pureeing as others suggested. I heated the mango sauce until boiling, let cool a bit, pureed in food processor, and returned to sauce pan on warm until needed. I had a fabulous piece of sea bass - about 12 ounces and 1 1/4 inches thick served two. Served over saut√©ed spinach with Sushi rice on the side.

The only thing I'll do next time is use a cheaper fish like Orange Roughy or Mahi Mahi. The reason I say that, I used an expensive Chilean Sea Bass and the sauce and crust was a little over powering for that delicate fish. It was very good, just hid the fish flavor more than I'd have liked.

I guess not getting eggs was a mistake because as I was checking out allrecipes.com I found this gem of a recipe. Luckily I have a non crazy  neighbor that was able to provide the one measly egg needed for this recipe. No running to the store which was nice. Although running the store would have been a good idea so I could burn some of the calories I consumed eating this delicious dessert. Honestly though I‚Äôm not sure the egg was needed. Im thinking I could have just cut the butter in the flour/sugar mixture and it would have worked out. Eh regardless it was still good and I would make it as written again. Well Except maybe less butter. I think the butter could probably be reduced without anyone knowing the difference. I don‚Äôt know about you but I could do with fewer calories. I think this would be great with apples or peaches as well.  Now I‚Äôm off to provide my lovely neighbor with a bowl of this deliciousness for making it possibly for me to enjoy this delightful dessert on my lunch break.

Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt Cake,"['           Change nothing! This recipe is exactly as it should be. ', ""           I loved it. My first time baking a cake since a highschool classroom, over 25 years ago, and I'll definitely be baking more. I followed the directions as is, and it came out great.

First, the recipe calls for an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings. It appears by most photos that everyone used a larger can by how many pineapple rings are on their cakes.  I could not find an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings so purchased a Dole 20 oz. can (in heavy syrup) and measured out what would be 8 oz. which turned out to be 4 pineapple rings and about 1/3 cup of juice. (That kinda makes no sense because now I needed 2/3 cup of milk and she calls for 1/4 cup or as needed - this seems like a big leap but that's ok - I did use 2/3 cup of milk to bring that to 1 cup). I did decide to use another couple of pineapple rings from the  can because it looked too sparse just using 4 which didn't seem to make any difference in the end anyway. Secondly, the recipe calls for an 18.25 oz boxed yellow cake mix.  What I found was 15.25 oz. Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. Could this be the reason why so many cakes are coming up with too much moisture?  Maybe. Thirdly, like many others at 40 minutes a wooden skewer showed that my cake was still not baked through.  I left it another 10 minutes (a total of 50 minutes) and then it was done perfectly.  Making those changes though - made an absolutely terrific Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt¬Æ Cake! Couldn't give it the 5 stars I wanted to for all of the diversions I had to make to the original recipe buts it was 5 stars after my changes.  I hope that helps some others! "", '           This was great! Easy! I cooked it for 40 minutes @350¬∞    I substituted raspberries for the cherries. I did find that letting it sit for about an hour made the cake less fragile when I cut it. I also served homemade whipped cream on top with 4-5 fresh raspberries on the side. ', '          A couple of notes about this recipe; first the baking time is off, most bundt cakes need at least an hour of bake time. Second, I think the amount of butter for the topping needs to be reduced, maybe 1/4 cup would work better as this is not being baked in the traditional cast iron or 9x13 pan. I dried my pineapple and cherries before putting them in the pan. Hope this helps. I will definitely make it again, it‚Äôs delicious and look beautiful. ', ""          Beautiful and delicious!  I think I'm going to use the same basic recipe and make a lemon upside down Bundt cake.  Love the caramelized butter/pineapple/cherries.  Made the cake look quite elegant.

The meatballs just didn't work for me in combination with pineapple. The flavors don't mesh well, and I am just not a fan of cooked pineapple.  Sadly, it was very much reminiscent of something I would have eaten in the 70's but I must have forgotten that I didn't like it then either.  We threw it out, and I won't be making it again.

Pineapple Sweet and Sour Sauce,"[""          Thank you so much for the instruction on how to achieve smooth sauce using cornstarch; some may think it's a no-brainer but I did not know how.

I had pineapple rings on hand which worked just perfect. I would recommend more cornstarch for a thicker sauce, but that's a preference thing. Would make again and could fit an even bigger ham if needed. ""]"
Hawaiian Cole Slaw,"[""          I tried this for the first time a  few days ago and I think it's the best Cole Slaw recipes I have ever tasted. I found it was best the second day.

Delicious Pineapple Muffins,"[""          I didn't change the recipe. It definitely needed morre time to bake. Didn't rise as much as in the picture. Soggy in the centre. Taste of pineapple was lost. Topping was a bit chewy. D;ifficult to get out of the muffin pan. Disappointing for all the prep that was needed and ingredients. "", '           I stirred the pineapple into the batter at the end because I didn‚Äôt read the directions carefully. I threw in a big handful of coconut and did not add butter on top. I put a half a maraschino cherry on top and a teaspoon of the crushed pineapple I had left because I had the larger can. I think I could have cut down on the sugar just a bit. I think this is a fabulous recipe. I would love to serve these in the afternoon with tea. ', '          These are ok, nothing great. ', '          Only added 1/3 cup coconut.

The muffin itself also had a bit of a strange taste, I wonder if 1 tbsp baking powder is just too much... ', '           Ended up really crumbly. I used fresh pineapple, added most of the pineapple into the batter. Reserved a small amount for topping. Would add more reserved pineapple next time, otherwise really great taste-wise.

Instant Pot Tacos al Pastor,"[""          I don't recommend trying this with any other cut of pork besides what is listed. I tried it with pork loin because my grocery store only sold pork butt in huge quantities, and I wanted something a bit less fatty. I figured it wouldn't change much -- I was wrong. I followed the instructions exactly and didn't adjust the cooking time. The pork was cooked fine but the sauce turned out very weird and separated, so I didn't want to pour it over the meat. As a result the pork was quite dry. I know this is my fault for not following the recipe, but I'm still giving it 3 stars because the flavor simply is not like true tacos as pastor. It's far too sweet. "", '          My husband declared this better than our favorite Mexican restaurants version. This will definitely be a keeper. ', '          Complicated but well worth the effort! al Pastor tastes amazing! ', ""          This recipe, which I followed exactly, made a fine and tasty meal, but I have to say it tasted nothing like authentic Mexican pastor meat.  I had high hopes given some ingredients I had never used before (sazon and chipotle peppers in adobo) but sadly, that elusive pastor flavor just wasn't there. Plus, it was a heckuva lot of work! To me it was much closer to a pulled pork sandwich in flavor than a Mexican pastor taco.  Kudos, however, for the high pressure method which did indeed create perfectly fall apart meat. Note: I marinated for about 9 hours -- no doubt it might have been better to marinate even longer but I still don't think the flavor would be there. Search continues for at-home pastor... "", ""           Perfect recipe for the home cook to make al pastor! The flavor profile was spot on to us and took us back to Mexico, where our obsession with al pastor began. I made the recipe as written with minor substitutes and cook time adjustment due to the amount of meat I had. The only substitutes I made were using canned Chipotle sauce as the Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce were out of stock (used 3 tbsp sauce and probably should have added another 1-2 tbsp), and corn tortillas as that's our preference. I had about 4.5lb pork butt and cooked for 45 min with 15-20 min natural pressure release. Since I made this the night before, I saved the juices in the pot in another container to reheat the meat in the oven so it wouldn't dry out. This recipe is the only one I will make going forward for al pastor. Thank you for the recipe! "", '           I am a big big fan of the Al Pastor at my local Mexican restaurant. Have been a little intimidated by the traditional spit roasting, so looked up a recipe that was a little more accessible. ', '          Made it for for 12, it was delish! Homemade guacamole and homemade pick de Gallo, used corn tortillas for more flavor. I would use crushed pineapple next time. ']"

I cut the lemon juice way down and added white vinegar. I was making a larger batch so I kind of eyeballed the rest of the ingredient amounts. I think this is a sauce you need to taste as you mix because there is a certain amount of personal preference when it comes to the sauce. We will definitely enjoy having this meal again!

World's Best Cream Cheese and Pineapple Dip,"[""          I was so disappointed with this. I followed the directions but used a very small quantity of garlic powder.

Precious Pineapple Cake,"[""          I like this recipe bc it doesn't call for extra sugar.

Ham and Pineapple Dinner,"[""          It was pretty good, if maybe a little bit too sweet.  I also think the sauce thickened up just a bit too much - congealed rather than 'saucy'.  I'd cut back on both the brown sugar and cornstarch slightly.

I warmed the juice & apple cider vinegar on the stove with the brown sugar & Dijon mustard (since I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúprepared mustard‚Äù is).

I took others\' advice and marinated the chicken and pineapple in separate containers.

Slow Cooker Tacos al Pastor,"['           This was incredible! Served for my husband and friends and everyone loved it.

Hawaiian Pineapple Chicken,"['          I love this recipe but I made some changes. I always double the sauce ingredients because everyone likes to pour the sauce over their rice. I do a full can of pineapple chunks and stir it into the sauce once it‚Äôs thickened. Of course it makes it a bit runny again but it‚Äôs so tasty no one cares. Sometimes I sub pork for the chicken which is tasty but not as good as chicken. It‚Äôs one of those meals that I can everyone to eat even picky eaters. Sometimes throwing some sliced red peppers into the sauce is an extra yummy taste as well. Yum! ', ""          I've made this a few times and it is really good! I always just used one pan on the stove, so easy that way. Even my picky DH loved it! That's amazing b/c he is sooooo picky! It's a very versatile recipe that can be adapted to what you like. I put carrots in it and snap peas and I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup once and it always turns out great "", '          This was so very tasty!  We loved it.  Next time, I might drop back on the butter and sugar.  It was a bit sweeter than we prefer, but it was still very, very good.  I only had pineapple slices in a 20-oz can, so I put half of the slices in a food processor and ground them up, placing the remaining slices on top for garnish with a sprinkle of pepper and tarragon.

Added a clove or two of minced garlic, and a little smoked Chipotle pepper for a subtle zing.  It was good advice to double the sauce.  It allowed to have left over to pour over rice and along with the meat (boneless skinless thighs) made a nice rice bowl.  Next time might add some zucchini to the sauce after it is cooked, should only take about 10 minutes or so to allow it to soften a bit.  This one will be a new regular go to dish. ']"
BBQ Teriyaki Pork Kabobs,"['          Great recipe. I made the kabobs with pineapple and red bell peppers. ', '          So good!

Green Papaya Salad,"['          Taste just like the Thai restaurants! ', '          My favorite salad.  I use 2 Thai chili peppers and its perfect spice.   A few extras peanuts is. The topping ', '          The bitterness of the green papaya overwhelmed the other ingredients. ', '          Very good ', '          We live in the Pacific Islands I love Green Papaya salads. I am forced to substitute Red Peppers for tomatoes. This is a very easy and fun salad and it looks wonderful. We use fresh Basil also which is really Thai traditional. Lovely salad. I may try it as written when or if I reach the states ', ""          Note: Make sure you get the fish sauce that has a clear golden look to it (ex. Squid Brand). Also, Asian food stores sell the small mortar (get clay) & pestal (wooden) for around 5-10 dollars (great to use for all spices, plus it looks great in your kitchen...). I dont recommend using food processor, but to use mortar & pestal for garlic smashing and to bruise 12 halved cherry tomatoes. The salad will have a better texture if you just peel the papaya, then cut in half, lay it cut side down and use a julienne peeler so you have nice, long pieces of papaya in your salad. Referring back to the fish sauce -  I accidentally purchased the fish sauce that is Greyish/Cloudy looking, and it was absolutely inedible. I spoke to my friend that turned me on to this salad (she's Thai) and she said that the fish sauce I purchased was more for the authentic Vietnamese cooked dishes. It will ruin your salad, so be very cautious. "", ""          I had green papaya salad recently while visiting Hawaii.  There, it was fantastic.  I looked at this recipe and thought it sounded the same.  I didn't like it at all.  Maybe my papaya was too ripe.  The fish sauce was definitely too much.  I'll try to make it again, but next time, I'll make the salad as soon as I buy the fruit. "", '          Great salad.  If you don\'t julienne the papaya by hand (ridiculously time consuming), use the shredder in the food processor.  I buy the long beans for the recipe and cut them into 1 inch segments and set them aside to toss in at the end.  I seed the tomato and toss the ""guts"" into the food processor with the wet ingredients, and toss the leftover outside wedges of the tomato into the salad at the end, as well.  Fresh thai chilis work the best, but remember that you can adjust the heat by not adding all of the peppers\' seeds.  If your resulting salad is ""ring of fire"" hot, just add a bit more sugar to cut the heat. ', ""          My estimation is that 2 cups of shredded papaya is about the right proportion for this recipe. Best to use a mandolin board that can properly julienne the fruit into long thin matchsticks, but if all you have is a kitchen grater, use that large holes on the grater and try to get the shreds as long as possible. Easy on the fish sauce. It is very powerful, you may want to start out with half the amount shown and add more if desired. Not everyone is crazy about this flavor, even though it is authentic. I find that cashews work better than peanuts. Also about 5 cherry or grape tomatoes work better than a big tomato. Cut them into halves for bite sized pieces.  In most cases, the flavor of a cherry or grape tomato is fuller, fresher, and riper than the bigger ones, at least if you are buying them and not growing your own. For truly authentic texture and taste, bruise the beans a bit. Mortar and pestle are good for this, or you can make do with a rolling pin. Just a slight bruising to release the flavor, since the beans don't get cooked.   If made authentically, it will be hot, but feel free to step down the peppers if your palate prefers less heat. Use thai peppers if possible, or serranos. ""]"
Mango Papaya Salsa,"['          This is wonderful on the side or on porkchops. We did not have a ripe avocado but threw in sliced grapes on a whim. This was our only change made to the original recipe. ', '           The wife said it was an excellent salsa (I had never used Papaya before)...refreshing.

Since avocados, papayas, and mangos are often purchased in different sizes, it would have been helpful having the ingredients measured out rather than just identified. Although a bit challenging getting the ingredients in the correct proportions,  a lot of tasting took care of that. I liked the salsa very much and have already used it on fish and tacos. ', '          I substituted lemon/lime juice for vinegar, added avocado too - this was SO INCREDIBLY DELISH!!!  Pairs very well with shrimp fajitas!

Grilled Macadamia-Crusted Tuna with Papaya Salsa,"['          Great recipe ! Delicious!

The salsa was really good too but isn't needed. The steaks are great by themselves! "", '          Made this dish and it was wonderful!  The nuttiness of the macadamia nuts was very interesting contrast to the Papaya salsa.  I had never used Papaya for salsa before and it was very good.

Papaya Bread,"['          Great flavor but I could not get it to set up correctly.  It would not bake through.   Very mushy inside at recommended cooking time.  I let it cook 15 minutes more, still mushy inside. I think next time I make this I will use the recipe as a filling for a crunch.  The way It turned out will make a good cobbler and heat it up with ice cream on top.  Oh and I did not add the Guava neuter.  It seemed to runny as it was.  Maybe my papaya was too mushy from the start. ']"
Papaya Bruschetta,"['          This was really good! I was surprised at how good and simple it was. This does not do very well as a leftover / after being refrigerated.

For my tastes, next time I'll double the red pepper and red/green onions. "", '          Catered a mixer with this recipe. They had a very small budget ad I was looking for a recipe which was low on cost but still impressive. Bruschetta usually fits the bill for those requirements but I wanted to do something a little different than the norm. This worked perfectly, guests loved it, great for summertime serving. I doubled the recipe but only used 5 tomatoes. I think if you used the full amount the flavor of the papaya would have been overwhelmed. ', '          This is a fantastic recipe!  I have made it many times now and my family and friends love it.  I add avacados which is good for more color and tastes good.  Thanks so much for this recipe! ', ""          The original idea is a good one, but like many others I modified a bit. I don't eat processed or cooked food much, so I used a good quality organic olive oil, no sugar (addictive and highly processed), lettuce instead of bread (I am still looking for a good raw bread substitute and lettuce don't get soggy), and added dates to sweeten the sauce. It is true that a ripe papaya can make all the difference. Choose one that is mostly yellow, soft but not mushy, and heavy. Fresh ingredients are always best! I used basil, tomato and papaya from my garden. With these adjustments, it was wonderful! "", ""          I HATE papaya, but we got some beautiful papayas as part of a Harry & David gift and I didn't want to waste them. This was surprisingly good! The tomato and vinegar offset the sweetness nicely. I recommend starting with no sugar, but add gradually to taste. I was also very unsure of what the papaya seeds would add-- I didn't know you could eat them. Our learning: yes, they're great as used here, but don't eat them alone! ;-) My daughter & I each crunched one before adding to the recipe. Don't try this at home. A little like crunching a black peppercorn. But in the blender as part of the dressing, they add a very unusual peppery flavor, like cracked pepper. For those who had problems with watery-ness: brush your baguette slices with a touch of olive oil (or spray lightly) and bake 5 min so they're good & crunchy, and definitely drain the salsa before spooning on. Thanks for a unique, light app that will be used several times this summer! "", ""          This was really yummy.  I am going to rate it 5 stars even though I changed an ingredient (ok two). I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used strawberry vinegrette and I used olive oil instead.  Even if I would have followed it, it would have been just as yummy- so try it! "", '          Excellent; I used half the sugar and drained before serving and it was perfect.  I halved the recipe and still had plenty for 8 people, unless this were a whole meal I think the portions are a bit off.  Would be great with mango too instead of the papaya. ', ""          This is fabulous.  It bugs me when people rate recipes but have essentially changed the original, but I must admit that I subbed mango for the papaya because that's what I had.

Mango Papaya Fruit Salad,"[""           This is very similar to how we usually eat papaya (with lime juice and honey). The addition of balsamic vinegar scared me a bit, so I cut that back to just a sprinkle (probably more like 1 tsp).

Thai-Inspired Confetti Salad,"['          I have made this twice now and my husband and I both really like it.

Not sure what fish sauce is (I am the sister of a chef, so I get to be all kinds of ignorant when it comes to food since that is her job!), but it is not what I thought it was, i.e. strongly fishy tasting.  Only change I made was to blanch the green beans for a few minutes before putting them in ice water.  Just didn't want raw green beans - call me wimpy if you want.

Papaya Passion Smoothie,"[""          I have been looking for a smoothie recipe to use my papaya in and this is my favorite.  I love this.

Avocado Salad,"[""          This is basically chunky guacamole, but still good.

Chocolate Avocado Pudding,"['          Used maple syrup instead of sugar and added a little coconut oil to help mask the ""green"" flavor. Melted dark chocolate and poured over and let it harden.

Also is great way to get omegas down our kids that refuse avocados because of the texture.After reading through some of the reviews it is obvious you need to be very careful about the ripeness of the avocados you use. An underripe or hard avocado will produce a grainy texture and funny taste. Ripe avocados (just gives slightly when squeezed) come out smooth with only a slight avocado flavor.We also used a higher quality coconut milk that we save to make curry with, that could also affect the end flavor because the milk is not super sweet but has a pleasant coconut flavor and mild smell. It also solidifies quickly and smoothly when chilled which would help the texture and how well this pudding sets up when refrigerated.Definitely needs to be well blended, but when done, it is perfection!The serving size seems a bit off too. Says it makes 4 servings. We found it to be so rich and satisfying that we figured it to be closer to 6 or 8 serving per batch if you can manage to stay out of it! "", '          Incredible!

Avocado Tomatillo Salsa,"['           This runs a close second and even better than any Tex mex restaurants around me!  This has become a household favorite any time we do Mexican food.

I made it mostly according to the original recipe - the only changes I made were to bake it in a Bundt pan instead of two loaves,  and I didn't have any buttermilk so I did like a couple of previous commenters and used 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/4 cup of milk instead. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  It was very moist and tasty and I will definitely make it again. Oh, and my bread was not at all green, but I was quite content with that. "", ""          This was awesome and delicious!  Made during COVID-19 while trying to use up too many avocados that I bought.

Loaf took a full hour and I think would have burned had I not covered with aluminum foil after 40 minutes.  Liked muffins a little more because they didn't cook as long.  Shared with neighborhood kids, my daughter's friends, and they loved it!  Will definitely make again. "", '          This bread was easy, quick, cheesy, and delicious.

But before my adjustments it was appalling. The sugar content was so high that it was more dessert than anything else. It was rather nauseating to eat and I had to throw it out. The next time, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/3 cups and it was still super sweet, so I then added a grated carrot and some ginger.

Chicken Stuffed Baked Avocados,"['          This was a good easy recipe. I used canned chicken, and it was still pretty good. It did make it more like a dip though.

I spread the rice as thinly as possible, yet covering most of the nori surface except the top 1/2"", then sprinkled some ground ginger over the rice. On half of the rolls, I used about 1T guacamole and some wasabi. On the other half I used wasabi & capers that I squished between my fingers before dotting onto the rice, about 10 capers per sheet. Added the salmon, wet the top of the nori and rolled them up with a bamboo sushi roller. The sharp meat knife I used, sliced through them perfectly! Delicious. THanks for the recipe.

The cheaper stuff has a slightly sealike taste that, combined with the smoked salmon, makes the finished roll way too fishy.

I read others skipped the mayo and added more avocado, and I would do that next time if I were to make this again. I‚Äôd still use a little mayo but just a little.

Quesadillas I,"[""          Worked out well enough, but you might have to increase cooking time to get a nice crispy outside. There's lots of flexibility with this recipe, too. You can change the filling, but use this recipe as a guide to make sure you aren't under- or overfilling your quesadillas. This is a good starting point for someone who hasn't made them before. "", ""           Making quesadillas in a frying pan is my preferred way to make. I spray the pan with just a little cooking spray. If using larger flour tortillas, fold them in half and place two in the pan, and they are easier to flip. I usually use Mexican blend cheese, but I love using half mozzarella and half cheddar. The submitter's idea of putting in a dash of hot sauce inside the tortilla is great. I prefer to put olives, salsa and avocado on the side. "", '          used mexican mix cheese ', '          Made  a few just mozz, few mixed mozz & mexican blend, few mozz, mex & swiss. Mine had some olives, hubbys didnt. The just mozz ones i made with tuscan seasoning and roasted peppers to go with pasta. No matter how you make them...delicious! ', '          just had this for lunch. If you run out of the mottzarello cheese your can use a different kind. Also good idea to have everything ready to go as it cooks up quickly. Will diffently will try again ', '          Mmmm loved the avocado in the quesadilla. Made to go as a side to taco soup/chili. ', ""          I've made this with flour wheat tortillas and with the corn tortillas - they both were great! The wheat tortillas were a little larger which made it easier to fill and handle in the hot pan. I used pepper jack and cheddar cheese. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe Cody. "", '          I added some hummus on the tortilla- delicious! ', '          My family has made a slight variation of this recipe for years. The main variation we do is that we add a very shallow coating of vegatable oil to the pan before placing the tortilla in it, and fry the tortilla until it is slightly crisp on both sides. It makes for a crunchier quesadilla, and when cut into slices, it makes a great appetizer or movie/game snack. Good basic recipe, thanks! ']"
Avocado Toast with Egg,"['          This is easy, healthy, and quickly made.  I served it with Chipotle fire roasted salsa, just the right touch. ', '          This was so good and so easy to make.

Awesome Turkey Sandwich,"['          Excellent  choice ! ', ""          This is an awesome sandwich, great for lunch, or a lazy evening when cooking isn't an option.

Thanks for the simple and delicious idea! ', '          We found these fairly bland, but I like the basis.   When I try again, I will slice, and season the slices individually to get a bit more flavor.   I think Cajun would be good on this. ', '           Very good! All it needed was a sprinkling of sea salt at the end...tasty! I would make these again. Thanks for sharing. :) ']"
Taco Salad III,"['          Love this recipe.  I make it regularly and often tweak it depending on what I have on hand.  I\'ve also used the recipe with some added ingredients as a ""build your own"" taco salad bar when I have a few guests at lunch.  I always put out sour cream, black olives and diced green chilies for those who like a little ""fire"".  Always a success.  For just my small family, I use the recipe as printed but cut it in half.

Vegetarian Tortilla Soup,"['          OK...  I made this for the first time tonight, and followed the recipe exactly.  Some comments follow:1.  It is a good tasting soup, but not great.  Strong tomato taste.2.  Canned chopped peppers...?  There is no such thing in my local store.  There are 50 varieties of whole, sliced and diced peppers.  I used diced.3.  When I opened the Pepper and Onion Stir Fry Mix, I realized it is just red, green and yellow bell peppers with onion.  This soup would undoubtedly be better with fresh ingredients.  The frozen ingredients turn out too soft.4.  The Avocado is essential and adds significantly to the taste.  Do not skip this.5.  There are no tortilla strips suitable for this soup at my grocery.  I used plain and blue-corn triangle chips as a substitute.  Not great.6.  The cheese is optional - skip it.I may make this soup again, but I would use fresh ingredients and probably add some fresh celery, cut back on the ground cumin, and may skip the tortilla chips. ', '           Delicious vegan soup or good with chicken broth. We add 1/2 c rice and 2-4 c black beans. ', '          I have always questioned whether 3 Tablespoons of cumin is correct.  A NYT recipe calls for only 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder.  I have wondered if the correct amount of cumin is 3 teaspoons rather than Tablespoons.  I always use fresh red, yellow and orange peppers, onion, garlic and often fresh jalape√±o and add frozen corn, as well.  I plan on experimenting with different spices like coriander in the future. ', '          Delicious! I used 2 cans of green chilies instead of 3 and added a can of beans. If you want to add protein, chicken makes it even better! ', '           So good!!!! ', ""          I thought it was great! My husband and son didn't care for it because there were no dead animals in it. I only had 1 can of green chiles so I threw in 3 fresh jalapeno peppers. That probably made it more spicy, but I thought it was perfect "", '           Very filling! And very tasty! I added black beans and topped it off with lime tortilla chips, avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and shredded cheddar... then squeezed a little lime juice on top. So very good! My youngest son refilled his bowl twice! ', '          I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. Incredible depth of flavor!  And super easy to make. I made it a day ahead to let the flavors develop and meld. Crowd favorite! ', '          This has been a favorite of ours since like 2006 or so. We make it a little differently, but the ""base"" is the same. I add a can of black beans and use an immersion blender to mix everything together. Then we add corn at the very end if we have it on hand. I probably use a little less broth too. But this has been on our regular rotation for probably 13 years now. So good! ']"
Easy Keto Beef Tacos,"['          We made these and LOVED THEM!  so easy and oh so good...I made them exactly like the recipe said the first time, second time I seasoned the cheese with cayenne powder so it gave it a little kick.

Great concept and very good. The shells make it a little greasy. Hard to do several at a time. You would need a wooden dowel.  The wooden spoon still wanted to roll on top of the glasses. Very filling though. I still lost a half a pound and stayed in ketosis. I will make again. ', '           Second time we made it.  Cooked the cheddar at 400 degrees for 6 minutes and made ""bowls"" out of the shells this time.', '          What a stupid recipe.', '          Used 4-cheese Mexican instead of straight Cheddar and tacos wouldn‚Äôt stay folded... tastes great though!

With all the mayo in the avocado it was to runny & messy. You couldn't taste the flavor of anything because of the messy mayo/avocado spread. Want to taste the mesquite smoked turkey & avocado especially. "", '           This sandwich is so delicious and so versatile! You can use chicken as an alternative, or even make it into a grilled wrap if you don‚Äôt have ciabatta. ', '           Very simple and delicious sandwich.

Harvest Salad,"['          Loved it! ', ""          I served it last night for guests and they never commented on it, but I liked it!  One of our guests eats only keto, so I used sugar free jam and lower sugar cranberries so she could eat it.  I thought both the avacado and tomato were a bit out of place in it, so I might leave those out next time. I don't think they added much to the overall flavor. "", '          So delicious!

Original bag is gone to check. ', '          Recipe was pretty good.

Avocado Soup with Chicken and Lime,"['          This soup is amazingly good.  Making it for the second time in 2 weeks ', '           I have made this recipe several times since finding it, it‚Äôs a great base recipe that I have added the following to make it terrific for us. I cook my chicken in the pressure cooker seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder & Tajin for extra lime flavor. To the broth I add cumin, & chili powder, & riced cauliflower. I brown my onions in bacon fat prior to adding my garlic. I also dump in the drippings from my cooked chicken it adds loads of flavor. Top with fresh cilantro, and sour cream. We substitute Serrano for jalape√±os because we prefer it spicy, added some kale for my bowl, I wanted some greens! Great soup for cold weather. ', ""          This is one of my 'go to' soups.

', '          The first time I made this, I was not very impressed. No spices- cumin, chili powder, oregano, coriander; and simmering a soup for only 10 minutes does not really allow all the ingredients to get to know each other. I have made this twice since and have changed a lot. I only make it when I have the time. I slow cook the chicken using the ""Slow Cooker Carnitas"" recipe on this site and use the juices from that to start the soup, adding more stock if needed. ', '          The first time I made this as written and it had waaayyy to much lime.  This time I doubled the recipe and only added the juice from half of a small lime.  Instead of doubling the tomato, I added a can of Ro-tel.  I used rotisserie chicken  because I was feeing lazy and let it simmer for 30 minutes to soak up all the flavors.

Meyer Lemon Avocado Toast,"['          Phenomenally delicious! The subtle flavor of avocado, along with the lemon juice/zest, and fresh cilantro and chia seeds gave  a wonderful burst of flavor.

Avocado Dressing,"['           Awesomely delicious üíû I made it with a salad and crunchy chicken breast. I will be making again & again. Thank you ', '          I adapted your adapted recipe.

Next time I'll add a little cilantro.  Now the big question is how to store what we didn't eat for sandwiches, veggie dip, etc!

Avocado Egg Salad,"[""          It's good but not great. I got carried away mashing the mixture and ended up with more of a paste, not unlike guacamole instead of an egg salad.

It is good ', '          First, I haven‚Äôt reviewed an Allrecipes recipe in years!  But the bones of this ovo-cado egg salad recipe are THAT good, I had to.  Second, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, for me, 2 avocados/6 eggs would have been too much ‚Äòcado and too little ovo.  So, I started with 1 avocado (easier to add than subtract), mashed it, stirred it up with all the other ingredients, and, finally, added 7 cubed eggs.  For the egg/‚Äòcado sizes I was working with, this was absolutely perfecto!  Other than that, I followed directions like a good girl... mostly... and I ended up with the best egg salad I think I‚Äôve ever made.  And basically guilt-free, too (I doubt I used 1/3 c. mayo; I just kinda eyeballed it, scooping in a li‚Äôl spoonful).  I didn‚Äôt have a red onion either, so I just used 1/2 a li‚Äôl sweet onion I had.  I wonder if a red onion would have made it too quacamole-y for me when what I want is egg salad, not guac.  I did add a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and, yeah, YUM!  For the salt/pepper combo, I used a Himalayan salt/garlic mill and some celery salt and Penzey‚Äôs California Blend Pepper.  It was so good, BEFORE the flavors even had a chance to marry.  Perfect amount, too: it filled up a 4-cup Pyrex.  This will be my go-to for egg salad from here on.  THANK YOU, AngelaandJakers, for inspiring me to, at long last, put the two best fats on the planet together, one animal and one vegetable, into ovo-cado salad!  Best of both worlds.

Used Vidalia sweet onions as that's what I had (I prefer sweet onion so usually buy that) and sweet pickle relish as I didn't have sweet pickles.  The avocado I had was overly ripe but I used it.  The taste that stood out was the relish.  I probably won't make this again.   It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't exceptional.

Absolutely Amazing Ahi,"['          Love this recipe, and eat it for lunch quite a bit. I agree that it is a bit on the salty side, as I also use a low-sodium sub and cut the soy sauce back to half.

We used red onion instead of green and had a ripe mango that made it super special with the avocado ', ""          This was a great recipe and was used after scoring a full sized albacore tuna.  For its mild tuna flavor, this poke recipe really helped make the fish stand out.  The only part that I changed was putting half the amount of soy sauce.  It wasn't really needed but the other part of the recipe seemed to be balanced.  Will try this one again if I get another full tuna fish. ""]"
Quick and Easy Guacamole,"['          I really liked this recipe it was quick and simple. I added some tomatoes just to make it a little bit more interesting.

The only thing I did differently was to add more seasoning and made Luvann's guacamole (from this site).  My family objected to frying the tortillas for health reasons, so everyone made their own fajita burrito.  I really want to try it with the fried tortillas, so I will make it again! "", ""          I made this last night and it was phenomenal! My boyfriend is from Texas, and we currently live on the Jersey Shore. He works very hard, 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant. Since he works late every night, he usually misses dinner with the family, so every Saturday night I make him a big meal to come home to, and this week he wanted something in the line of fajitas. This recipe looked so good, and it did not fail to WOW him. I made it mostly verbatim, with the exception of the guacamole - I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand so I used regular pepper, and added a splash of lemon juice and lime juice to the guac, and it was SO good, he ate three servings and was so full he couldn't move for awhile, lol. He's bringing some in to work today to show it off to his coworker, who is from Mexico, and I'm pretty interested to see what he thinks since his wife is an amazing cook when it comes to authentic Mexican food.

However, my friend who does like cilantro thought the salad was great. I don't like to rate a receipe that I didn't make as stated (I left out the red onion and Jalapenos only becasue I didn't have them on hand, and scaled the recipe back to about half) but in this case it seemed appropriate. My friend really liked it and I think I would too if maybe I used a smaller bit of parsley instead of the large amount of cilantro the recipe calls for.

The sour cream is a great way to balance the spice; you get a kick of spice, but it fades away without burning your mouth.

Sure enough, here it is on All Recipes!!!  This is a delicious jam made exactly as written and I've received rave reviews from everyone I've gifted it to.  I'll be making a large batch in the next couple of days and canning it in a boiling water bath for gifts at Christmas and all year round!  Oh yes, and a few for my husband and me as well!!! ; )  Can't wait for this and some strawberry-rhubarb jam, too! "", ""          I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes just like dried apricots, so if you like dried apricots, you'll love the jam, too. Like Jessica Paige, I made it solely to use up some unappetizing looking dried apricots. I've used up all he jam now, and I like it so much that I went out and bought dried apricots so I could make another batch! "", ""          Thank goodness I found this recipe as I don't know what I would have done with the organic, unsulfured dried apricots my husband brought home one day. They sounded wonderful, but they tasted terrible...so I made apricots into jam! I didn't have any pectin, so I grated in an apple and used a bit of tapioca flour to help it congeal. I also used almond extract as I had more of that on hand than vanilla. Finally I  only had enough apricots to make about a cup of jam, so I just popped it in the fridge when I finished making it and we enjoyed it for the next week. All in all, a lifesaver...thank you Cookin4Six! for sharing this recipe! "", '          Way too much sugar. I only added 1/2 cup of Stevie. No pectin so added a 1/2 teaspoon of agar. Simmering under low heat for 15 minutes or until the jam thickens up. Good recipe. We used 500 grams of dried apricots and 2 large cans of apricots in heavy syrup. We discarded the syrup. Good recipe. No bwb bath. Just put in Ball pint jars and into the fridge. ', '          MMMMMM Love this.  I used 6 Tbls of my homade citrus pectin I canned yesterday and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  This will be great holiday food. ']"
Slow Cooker Chicken Tagine,"['          I made this for my book club following the recipe except didn‚Äôt shred the chicken. This dish was amazing!! Will make again for dinner parties.

Moroccan Beef and Lentil Stew,"['           I did the recipe but made pork loin instead of beef. Delicious! ', ""          Really, really good if you like lentils.  I've made it twice rhis week.

Adding 10 different spices to a dish gets you to that point.  I was generous with the carrot and celery (doubled the amt).  The final product was a bit thicker than I expected, but not TOO thick. Still, maybe another 8 oz of beef broth would have been just fine.  It was good for dinner, served with some corn muffins.  I'll certainly add this to my 'cook again' list.

Dried Apricot Pie,"['          Good easy pie recipe. I didn‚Äôt have orange liqueur, so I substituted 1 tsp of orange extract and added a bit more water to the filling. Topped with whipped cream, it was a hit for dessert. ', '          Waaaay too much sugar!!! Thank goodness I realized that before I put all that sugar in.  I used 1/2C sugar and it was ample.

', ""          I made this recipe pretty much as is except I cut the sugar in half because I like my pies to be sweet/tart. The apricot flavor of the pie was very intense - unfortunately - the sulfur taste had intensified also. I love apricot pie so I put the pie down the disposal and tried again using unsulfured apricots. I had to adjust the amount of water and simmering time because unsulfured apricots are hard and dry as well as being dark. The filling was charcoal grey, which I could have lived with, but it was also bitterly intense.  I wish I could have made it work but I won't try this recipe again unless another reviewer has a suggestion which might help. "", '          I added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and used slab apricots which are already cut.  I only had to bake for 30 minutes, otherwise the crust would have burned.

Instant Pot Chicken Tagine with Apricots and Chickpeas,"[""          Very good hearty dish. Agree with other suggestions - doubled the spices and added in the chicken broth earlier to deglaze spices. Threw in 1 cup  red potatoes  and 1/2 cup carrots chopped large because I could:) (it's that kind of flexible dish). I added chickpeas before cooking (rather than at end). Used 2 chicken thighs frozen  and set instant pot for 10 minutes and did great. NPR for about 10 minutes.    Shredded the chicken into the dish. Yummy. "", '          Family loved it.  Kids enjoyed trying something new.  Great combination of flavors.  I did not use Instant Pot, but did this in the oven -- is there any way you can add oven cooking instructions to some of the Instant Pot recipes. ', ""          This was very easy and delicious. I used chicken breasts for dietary reasons and it still turned out great - though I suspect thighs would have been even better. I added fresh ginger because I had it. I used crushed tomatoes because it's what I had in the cupboard. And I chopped a large sweet potato and threw it in because, why not? Totally great! Will make it again. "", ""          Made this recipe almost exactly as written and it's a great start. The only differences I made was to add the tomatoes and chicken broth to the onions and spices to deglaze the pot so I wouldn't get a burn warning and add a handful of golden raisins since I had them. When I make this again, I think I will double the spices and I will use chicken thigh filets since the skin just got slimy being pressure cooked.

Fruity Couscous Salad,"['          Liked it.

I then added dried fruit to cook for a minute or two.  I added this to the already cooked couscous.I substituted pistachios for the almonds and sprinkled chopped parsley before serving ', '          Cooked the couscous in a combination of the craisin water used to ""cook"" the craisins and the remaining part OJ.

I left out the apricots and scallions but added two shredded carrots. ', '          Simply delicious! Definitely prepare it using orange juice vs. water for more flavor. Like others, I cut the amount of cumin down to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of curry powder.  Instead of dried apricots I added an 11 oz. can of mandarin oranges.

Moroccan Chicken Tagine,"[""          This is a really tasty dish but the recipe only calls for 1/2 Cup of the spice mix you've created meaning that you're left with allot left over. I used breasts but otherwise followed recipe exactly. The family enjoyed it. There is no spiciness at all so might add a little next time. Also, will try using a whole chicken next time putting the spice under the skin and in the cavity to use it all up. And maybe the insta pot. "", ""          SO GOOD. I adapted the recipe for the Instant Pot/pressure cooker. I used chicken thigh filets - 6 pieces, because even though I adjusted the spice section to 2 servings rather than 6, I had a ton of spice leftover. I added the oil and seared the chicken in the IP, removed it, and added the onions and garlic. When they were ready, I added the apricot, chicken broth, etc (didn't have mint or cilantro so skipped it) - BUT then I also added a cup of basmati rice, stirred, then added the chicken on top. Cooked for 10 minutes, then let rest for 18 minutes. I probably could have added another half cup of rice, but as-is was AMAZING.

I use a whole chicken instead of just thighs and it works really well, and it gives us more meals for weeknight dinners! ', ""          Flavor was good, but a little too strong. It seems like a lot of seasoning for just 4 pieces of chicken. I would try 6 or even 8  pieces next time. Probably will cute down the honey by 1/3 as well.

I didn't add all the sugar to my cut fruit because I had tasted them and they weren't terribly bitter.  The end result was tart and sweet but next time I will add more than 1/8 c sugar.  I had 7cups of apricots but I didn't need to double the topping recipe - it was sufficient to spread all over. Would be great with berries as well. "", '          Tasted good.  Added 1Tb flour to apricots, but it still was soupy and the crisp sank so overall kinda of a waste of fresh apricots.  Would not make again. ', ""          I liked this and will make it again.  However, BEWARE THE  AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR. The MAJOR  change I made is the amount of sugar.  This recipe calls for 3/4 c. of brown sugar in the topping. That seemed incredibly high so I checked a recipe I have for  a cranberry apple crisp which I make often.  That  recipe calls for only TWO tablespoons  packed brown sugar.  I can't imagine what this crisp would  taste like with 3/4 c.  of brown sugar.  I assume it would overpower the apricots and be way to sweet for my taste.  In terms of butter, I used the microwave to melt it rather than than cut it in.   Faster and easier.   I also followed the suggestions of others and added the almond extract and the flour and doubled the topping.

So excited to find these and will continue to change up the recipe :) ', ""           I like the idea of an oat-free granola, seeing that I'm allergic to oats. This recipe won't let you down as far as taste goes. There is a bit too much oil and cinnamon for us, so next time I will certainly reduce those amounts. It makes a very large batch, keep that in mind. After two hours on the counter it had hardened into a loose granola. I ate that with a banana and some milk, like a cereal, and loved the taste. and crunch. After freezing it, I was able to cut it into bars, but they melt quickly. It is summer, so it is ok. A nice cool, healthy treat is not a problem. I don't know how well this will travel; but on top of cereal, ice cream, yogurt, etc., this is very good. Read the notes first for some good tips.

I cut the glaze recipe by a third and I poke the still-warm cake all over with a fork and slowly pour the glaze on. You don't want to use a cool cake as the crust hardens and won't absorb the glaze as easily.

I wonder if it would be better with added sliced carrots and/or red bell pepper, while cutting down on the amount of dried apricots.  I also wonder if adding some cumin, cayenne, and maybe a small amount of cinnamon might give the sauce a warmer, more complex profile to balance the sweetness.

I opted to try Meyer lemon jelly instead of apple, as I had canned quite a lot of it. The sauce was on the sweet side, as I imagine it is intended to be, but not lemony. I did baste every 20 minutes, and add a tiny bit of broth, as others suggested to keep the drippings from scorching. A keeper. Thank you. ', ""          We made this for Thanksgiving dinner in lieu of ham or turkey and it was AHHHHHHHMAZING!  it seems so fancy but was easy to put together .  I was afraid a pork loin would be just so dry but this cooking method makes sure it doesn't dry out at all.  The only changes I made were the omission of all salt and I left out the apple jelly from the port wine sauce since I didn't want it too sweet.  It was all just perfect and will definitely be a do again recipe! "", '          This recipe is great. Leaving a comment not only because it was awesome, but also it was impossible to find Apple jelly for the glaze that goes on the pork just before it heads into the oven. I used peach preserves.  Any preserve that goes with rosemary would work. Think that through before you get too creative. ;-) ', '          Great flavourful pork recipe! Be sure to monitor the temperature closely because overdone lean pork will be very dry. The port sauce is a real winner! ', '          I used two pork tenderloins for a dinner party of four. I was able to do all ahead that morning except for sauce at the end. It was, without doubt, the best pork I‚Äôve ever eaten... gourmet, totally gourmet. All three guests raved ', '          This recipe was amazing! I served a 5 lb pork loin for New Years Day dinner for 12.  I roasted the garlic before using it in this recipe, substituted peach pepper jelly for the apple jelly, and left out the cranberries. I fileted the roast, spread the filling over it, then rolled it like a pinwheel. For the sauce, I used a full cup of port but let it simmer and reduce while the roast was cooking.  Everyone loved it! ', '          Will be making this many timescale in the feature. ', '          Made using 2 pounds pork tenderloin and scaling back ingredients.  Having temps to check was do helpful in decreasing cooking time.  Made double sauce recipe. LOVED it. ', ""          This was absolutely stunning. I made it as a special meal for my husband on father's day. Instead of one huge pork loin I used 2 small ones, totaling 4 pounds. I used the same amount of stuffing and based on the reviews doubled the sauce. I was not disappointed! The sauce was a hit, and the pork was cooked perfectly. As long as you use an actual meat thermometer and cook to the right temperatures this will turn out properly, juicy, and perfectly cooked. ""]"
Apricot Salsa,"['          Mine was a little on the tart side ( apricots less sweet?) so I added a tablespoon of honey.   It came out great!!  I used it on everything from toast to tacos to hot dogs!

Not really an apricot fan, but gave this a shot and I am glad I did! Easy to make, and I‚Äôm thinking it will be better after sitting overnight. All real food. Served over chicken for dinner tonight, and may use as an actual salsa with chips at lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a nice fresh recipe! ', '          Very tasty! I took it to a BBQ and everybody loved it! ', '          This was a refreshing change, but I have to say make sure your apricots are not too ripe or the salsa will become too mooshy/saucy. Also it tends to discolor a tiny bit overnight. I ended up increasing the pineapple and adding some chopped fresh jalapeno instead of habanero. The rest of the ingredients I added to taste. ', ""          My tree had an over abundance of apricots this year.  I have a party to go to and thought this sounded tasty so I doubled the recipe.  My husband couldn't get over the flavor and even later came in and said what a great taste it left in his mouth.  I make lots of salsas and let's just say, half of the salsa I made for the party is staying home, I am not sharing.  Can't wait to try on a pork tenderloin tomorrow for dinner.

Apricot Glazed Chicken,"['          I made this exactly as written except I garlic salted and peppered the chicken before frying.   It was delicious.   If you fry the chicken brown, your sauce gets to be a deep garnet color because when you add the broth the brown bits on the bottom loosen up and blend into the broth.  Just stack your chicken on top of each other, add the broth, soy sauce  , then the preserves and whisk away until most of the jam is incorporated.

Apricot Glazed Carrots,"['           5.6.21 Made exactly as written and was quite happy with the way this recipe turned out.

Made it using baby carrots because that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again. ', '          I followed the recipe and it was quite good! ', ""          This is a really unique and tasty recipe. I was worried it would too sweet for my tastes, which is the reason I don't like traditional glazed carrots, but the lemon juice and orange zest really balanced it out perfectly. I used baby carrots, which ended up taking 20 minutes to boil. There actually ends up being more sauce than needed for the carrots, and we didn't want to waste it once the carrots were eaten. We used the leftover sauce for fish and rice, and I can imagine it might go well on chicken too.

Apricot-Pecan Sweet Potatoes,"['          I omitted the orange peel and used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I also chopped up 1/4 cup dried apricots and set them in 3/4 cup boiling water while the potatoes were boiling.  When I made the sauce, I added the apricots (with the water they were reconstituted in) after the sauce thickened. I found Jumex apricot nectar in the soft drink section of the grocery store. It comes in a 12-oz. can. I used the entire can and omitted the 1/2 cup water listed in the recipe. This makes a lot of sauce, so sometimes when I take it somewhere I use 6 pounds of potatoes for the same amount of sauce. And every time I take it somewhere, I get multiple requests for the recipe. ', '           I have made this every Thanksgiving for many years.  I cut the potatoes into strips and arrange in  the casserole with drained apricot halves and whole pecans (see other photos).  I cut the brown sugar a bit and use one recipe of the sauce for 4 to 5 large potatoes.  This method keeps the sweetness and calories down a bit.  I now also use the drained syrup from the apricots instead of the nectar to make a clearer, shiny glaze. ', '          I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, it was delicious!

I skipped step 6 (which isn't even listed in the ingredients anyway), and I chose to include the zest IN the final glaze while leaving off the almonds on top.

If making the smaller cake, check for doneness at about 50 minutes (the touch test--if the top springs back lightly at touch, it's done).  I used a chop stick to make the holes to let the syrup seep in.  I thought this was a very good cake!  Thanks for this recipe!

Southern Apricot Chicken,"[""          This was awesome.  I used 2 legs and 2 thighs with the skin on and it was great.  And there was lots of sauce left over.    I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

The sour cream provides a nice creamy texture and the mustard a pleasant zip. But while I liked the idea of a dish that required no extra cooking vessels, I decided to brown the chicken in a skillet before baking. That allowed me (1) to lock in more of the moisture and (2) to increase the time the chicken spent baking in the sauce, infusing more flavor. I really enjoyed the result and plan to make it again.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce because my family loves sauce and we always eat rice with our chicken. I cooked the chicken an additional 10 minutes in the sauce then tasted. After tasting I felt like it needed something so I added a tbsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I served over rice with veggies. It was amazing!! I didn't think the sauce was too rich and the flavor was great! I won't be making it all the time because we have other recipes we like more but it's definitely something I will make again! "", '          WOW !!!  If my husband can say ""This isn\'t bad honey"", this is a 10 in my books.  Before I added the chicken to the casserole dish I did think about browning it in a pan then letting everything simmer, BUT, instead I added olive oil to the dish before I put the chicken in.

However I am making it for the second time today, and I triple the espresso powder because I really couldn‚Äôt taste it in the first batch. I don‚Äôt know what to do about making the batter a little moist or maybe a little more butter I thought a quarter of a cup was kind of small amount for the 3 1/2 cups of flour.

Advise using the largest cookie sheet you have -- it makes a lot.  I'm freezing 2/3 of the cookies.  And head's up, biscotti dough needs some muscle for stirring.  Here are the changes I made because of things I didn't have on hand (no matter -- it's a forgiving recipe).  I omitted  apricots (didn't have); also I didn't have enough orange peel rind so I used lemon and lime rinds for zest.  I used all-purpose flour instead of pastry flour; and I only had freeze-dried instant coffee.  Apparently these are fool-proof cookies because with all my changes, they are perfect!  Didn't notice any coffee hint-flavor but probably because of my using freeze dried instant coffee instead of espresso instant.  Might be worth purchasing for the future.   And the crumbly bits make a perfect topping for yogurt (or ice cream or cereal). "", ""          I've never made biscotti before so I didn't know what to expect when mixing the dough but 3-1/4 cups flour is way too much!

I also left out the apricots and chocolate chips and dipped in chocolate instead. The dough is pretty stiff and difficult to mix all the goodies into so I just dumped it on the counter and kneaded them in. Also, I wish I would have flattened the logs even more so they would be long thin slices. I thought I went to about an inch, but I was a little over and it does rise. "", '           I thought this was a good recipe. I used it in some mailed cookie boxes for Christmas. I like how there is so much going on flavor wise. The orange zest flavor is pretty dominant and I liked that. The colors arent so vibrant like on the marichino cherry ones. I actually labeled what was in them, on the gift packages, because its hard to tell. Only change I made was halving the fruit and chopping it up. I also just chopped whole almonds. For the coffee I used starbucks instant Christmas blend grind. Lastly, I used cake flour and salted butter. The 2"" width, on the shaping, seemed small. I went with approximately 2.5."" I suggest that, because they dont puff up much larger after the first bake. They still are a smaller biscotti. I had no issues with cutting them which was nice. I hope the food gift is liked. ']"

To tone down the heat, I omitted the black pepper and substituted Trader Joe's Chile Lime Seasoning Blend for the chili powder. The reason I toned down the heat is because I served it over Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from All Recipes, which has a good kick (even though I reduce the 3 Tbsp Chipotle Chile Powder to 1 Tbsp).

So I cut the amount in half--and it was STILL too much vinegar...plus, it lacked complexity--the cilantro and balsamic don't play well together, ime, and it was missing some heat.

I used a Pillsbury pie crust and had to make my own jiffy corn mix(found it online). Followed the recipe as written. The only hiccup I had was the baking of the lower crust with the muffin mix for 5 to 8 minutes. Go for the 5, I over baked it a little and it wouldn‚Äôt press into the top crust so next time I‚Äôll lessen that a little but it didn‚Äôt affect the taste or appearance of the pie.

Nectarine Blush,"['          We had picked up 5lbs of Nectarines and we needed to use them quickly. This recipe is surprisingly great. I thought the buttermilk would make it taste sour, however, the sweetness of the fruit with buttermilk made this taste outstanding.  I use an extra nectarine and some extra ice and this was something I will make next summer as well ', '          I tried this because my daughter had her wisdom teeth removed and needed a smoothie, I had all of the ingredients so I decided to try this one. I always make my own ""buttermilk"" by using regular milk and lemon juice (1-1 1/2 tsp lemon juice then fill to the 1 C line) so that was the only slight change I made. This prevented the overly strong buttermilk flavor many people observed. I used white nectarines that I had allowed to ripen until soft, then had them refrigerated...perfection.

I watched as he quickly drank the first glassful and I asked him to comment while I poured him a refill (this was about 30 seconds later).  He said it was ""peachy,"" (of course he MEANT ""nectarine-y""), and that there was ""something odd about it - but in a good way."" Only after he finished the last of this 2-serving recipe did I reveal there was buttermilk in the drink, to which he quickly scrunched up his nose. And then he rated it four stars.  I never saw him drink a smoothie that fast. I made this exactly as the submitter directed and threw a few ice cubes into the blender as well.  Hubs said he appreciated that this wasn\'t so cold that it gave him an ice cream headache.  Maybe that\'s why it went down in a New York Minute. ', '           Hmm, well, this just did not go over well with me.  About the only reason I could give is that it was ""too much.""  I did peel and freeze the nectarines first, because I already knew it would be almost warm if I didn\'t.  So if you happen to like this, I definitely would suggest the freezing, and even half-freezing the buttermilk. ', ""          Very good, and good for you! I did find the buttermilk flavor coming through a tad strong, so I think I'll cut back on that next time and supplement with regular milk or, as other reviewers tried, with orange juice. The nectarine flavor is great and its just so simple to make! Thanks for sharing your recipe! "", ""          I would give it five stars, but I didn't think that was fair considering that I changed the recipe some. I took CC's advice and chopped the nectarine up, froze it and then used half OJ and half buttermilk. The buttermilk would have been overpowering if I had used the full cup. (and I love buttermilk!) So the recipe, as is, would be good, but not something I make again. With those changes, it is now my all-time favorite smoothie! "", '          love buttermilk and this is great - no sugar needed. Does need to be well chilled.  Other fruit can be used, but prefer nectarines.   Thanks..... ', ""           I do like buttermilk in a smoothie, but it was too dominant here, and though I used sweet ripe nectarines, their flavor did not come through as I was expecting. Because the recipe doesn't use frozen fruit or ice, it was warm, which was not appealing. I added a frozen banana after the fact which helped make it slightly icy and more refreshing. Ice cubes would dilute the flavor even more. I might make this again if I have buttermilk to use up, but I would chop up the nectarines ahead of time and toss them in the freezer overnight, cut the buttermilk in half and make up the difference with orange juice.

"Summer Nectarine, Tomato, and Cucumber Salad","['           This was really good!!! I found it a little on the bland side as written, but I added a sprinkle of salt and that made a world of difference. I also ended up adding a drizzle of white balsamic, as suggested in the Cook\'s Notes.  This is best eaten right away, as the goat cheese ends up ""melting"" into the salad and turning the liquid whitish. Definitely doesn\'t affect the flavor though! I will be making this again!  Also note that this makes way more than 4 side servings. ']"
Sticky Orange Chicken with Nectarines,['           I made Sticky NECTARINE Chicken instead. I have some very ripe nectarines that I pitted and boiled in enough water to cover them. I added some non-sugar sugar. Pur√©ed the nectarines and skin with an immersion blender. Then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. We are not folks who like it really hot so I halved the pepper sauce. It was still more heat than we wanted. I added some more nectarine juice which helped. ']
Nectarine-Raspberry Crumble,"['          I always feel bad rating things that I changed, but since there was only one rating I thought I would give my two cents. ', '           The crumble topping is amazing and I would give five stars to the crumble alone!  The filling is where I had some problems.   The raspberries and nectarines are slightly tart, so, only using 2 tbsp. of sugar left for a more tart filling that I would have preferred.  There is also no thickener in the filling other than the natural pectin in the fruit.  The filling was very runny.  I would have preferred a thicker sauce with the fruit. 7/7/18 My review above was based on when we ate the dessert the same day we made it. Today I upped it from 3 to 4 stars.  The flavors melded together and wasn‚Äôt nearly as tart as it was yesterday.  I do still think the sauce is a little thin for us and I would add a little thickner. ']"
Nectarine Bars,"[""           These bars were a fantastic way to use some very ripe nectarines I had. The bars are really quite easy to make, and taste great. I will give a warning on the bake times though: my crust began to brown in just 20 minutes, and the filling was already set after 15 minutes of baking. If I had baked the filling the 30 minutes as stated, the bars would've been way overdone--and maybe burnt. So just keep a close watch on baking times. Also, for the crust, I used unsalted butter, so I added 1/3 tsp of salt to dough, plus 1 tsp vanilla extract for flavor. I added the flour to the butter/sugar mixture just until it formed crumbs (only needed 1 2/3 cups flour). For the filling, I only used a 1/2 cup sugar since my nectarines were super super ripe, and took the submitter's advice to add some lemon juice to it (only 1 tbsp). I also lined my baking pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides; thus making it super easy to get the bars out of the pan. Overall, we really enjoyed these bars, and I will make them again--and maybe try them with other fruit as well. Thank you for the recipe. ""]"

Fresh Fruit Basket Cobbler,"[""          Delicious flavor, but very very sweet to me.  Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth,  I would probably reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar on top to about 1 tablespoon and use a little less jelly next time.  Amazingly enough, the white pepper really did set off the sweetness of the fruit without being easily identifiable as pepper.   Mine turned out a tad bit too soupy, but I wouldn't fault the recipe for that. The fruit I used was at peak season and fairly juicy, so next time I'll compensate with a bit more cornstarch.

KK's Three Fruit Cobbler,"['          So mine didn‚Äôt come out as expected but it was good. It‚Äôs been outrageously hot so the topping turned into more of a mushy texture even when browned, and the flavor of the topping was too strong. I think I‚Äôd definitely do a different kind of topping and add the cinnamon and ginger to the fruit which I‚Äôll precook on the stove to make a more cohesive filling. The flavors are amazing, I think next time I‚Äôll try it with plums, more raspberries, cherries, and maybe blackberries or another tart fruit. I also sprinkled the fruit with a little cornstarch to thicken the juices into a sauce, which I definitely recommend if you don‚Äôt want to wait an extra 30 min of cooking for it to thicken on its own.

"", '          Yum ', ""           This has great fruit flavor, but the topping was too much, in my opinion. A good portion of it sank and mixed into the fruit juices, which gave everything a weird texture. I think halving the amount of topping might help that part. I also had to bake mine at least an extra 25-30 minutes to get the fruit cooked down and not be soupy, and to get the top browned. Part of that was my fault, as I realized too late that I used a Pyrex baking dish, which is not broiler safe. So make sure you use a broiler safe pan so you can properly brown the topping. I also felt it could use less sugar, and more raspberries, but that's personal preference.  I would make again, as I really enjoy the plum/nectarine/raspberry flavor combination, but I would definitely make a few adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

Oatmeal Chocolate Coconut Macaroons,"[""          I have made these for half a century, most are complaining they are too runny. Here is the reason. The ingredients you boil must be done so until you achieve a rolling boil, reduce heat to medium,  stirring constantly, and only when this mixture is at the 'hard ball' stage (drop a couple of drops into a glass of cold water, if the ball does not disintegrate and remains intact, it is ready) is it ready to be mixed with the dry ingredients. I usually use a pot big enough to take the entire recipe and mix the dry stuff quickly and start dropping by teaspoonful onto waxed paper. If you dawdle, they will harden in the  pot. So the hard ball stage must be met before you finish these cookies. I have tried removing them before they are ready and it is a soft runny mess. Hope this helps, because it is a great little snack, done right. "", ""          Way way way too much sugar in recipe.Cut the sugar in half (or more),  and it's like my mom used to make.  Yummy.

No-Bake Chocolate Coconut Cookies,"['          I agree with several other reviewers; there is a large amount of oats here for the amount of syrup produced.

Incredibly Delicious Italian Cream Cake,"['          I typically don‚Äôt give bad reviews but this cake was very bland and I really like an Italian cream cake. ', ""          I found this recipe over 15 years ago. It's my favorite Italian cream cake recipe. I'm a GA girl, so I prefer pecans to walnuts. "", '          This recipe is five stars, BUT only with the absolute must do part of separating the eggs. Thus, 4 stars as the result will be greatly affected by the technical aspect. This cake in order to be springy and light needs that extra lifting done by the egg whites. The air incorporated during the beating of the butter an sugar won\'t be enough and also the leavening agents alone without the beaten egg whites won\'t do it either. You need to do that step and be mindful of incorporating the whites in thirds without under or over mixing. If the whites are not mixed enough, you might end up with little pieces of egg white in the cake. Also, the buttercream/cream cheese frosting might need to be doubled. I made half of the recipe for testing it. I could have added a third 6"" round mold but decided to keep the two and slice both. My cake was in the end a 4 tier cake and it was BEAUTIFUL!!  Since I went this route,  the frosting was not enough to cover the 4 tier cake. I increased the frosting amount using an extra cup of powdered sugar, an extra tbsp of butter, 2 TBSP of heavy cream, and a splash of extra vanilla. The result was FANTASTIC after those appropriate technical and ingredient adjustments for the frosting. For a more decadent flavor, I toasted the coconut flakes to intensify the coconut flavor and make the cake even better!  Overall, it tasted better than any frosted cake I can buy at the grocery store\'s pastry shop. My grocery store\'s got good cakes but not like this one. ', '          I made this--it was very dry--I think the recipe is right--I feel it was my fault--I let it cook too long.  I have the same recipe--but it tells you to separate the eggs--like the lady said--whip them and fold them into the batter--I suggesst using 2 teaspoons of vanilla and I also added 1/2 cup of pecans chopped to the batter--If you dont make these changes--your cake can be very dry --especially about the time of cooking--that was my main error- ', ""          I followed this recipe exactly. Although I read the comments about it not releasing from the pan, so I greased AND floured my pans. This cake tested done with a toothpick, but would not release from the pan, it literally TORE IN HALF when it came out. The cake is very dense and greasy, not like a true Italian Cream Cake. This seems more like a greasy, floppy, failure. A vanilla yellow brownie with coconut. I won't be making this one again. Very disappointed, don't even want to bother frosting it. "", '          Made it according to the recipe but did divide the eggs and add the whites to the batter later as suggested.  Did not care for the cake flavor at all.  It was very heavy and lacked taste.  Blah...but the frosting was good so I guess that saved it from one star. ', '           Great flavor, I did follow HJONES999 suggestions, plenty of batter. ', '          excellent flavor ', '          I give this recipe a 10! So good! I read the reviews and opted to make a 2-layer cake. It did rise up to the rim of the pans and fortunately it didn‚Äôt overflow. I baked it on 300 for about an hour. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts because I prefer them. I added almond extract to the cake batter and the frosting. I used 3 cups of confectionary sugar instead of 4 in the frosting. I lightly toasted the almonds and coconut. I think untoasted coconut is too chewy. I separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites and then folded them into the batter. I loved this cake and everyone else loved it too! ']"

The only thing that bothered me was that I couldn`t do the cracker crust. I removed the sugar(as a user recommended) and put just the crackers and the melted butter together but the crumbs didn`t really stick together no matter what I did.  Should i use the flaked coconut to stick the crumbs too? Also, I had to put more than 2 cups of crumbs because my pan was really big ', '          Easy to do and delicious! ', '           The recipe specifies the wrong size pan. This should be a 9x13 or 11 x 8. As written, the recipe results in a sticky, greasy, gooey mess. I tried to fix it by additional cooking time at a slightly higher temp. If there is a next time, I would skip the sugar in the crust and reduce the amount of butter. I like the idea of putting the coconut on top for texture. I just prefer shredded coconut, no toasted. ']"

Thirty Day Friendship Cake,"[""          I use 6 foil loaf pans to bake then and I  use toothpick method, about 50 mins. that way you can put them in ziplock bags for freezer after they cool in their pans. They last a while and you don't eat it all at once. Easier to share. At Christmas, for special friends, I just pull 1 or 2 loaves out of the freezer,  thaw. Remove from bag (if you want) and at that time of year you can usually find decorative plastic bags to put it in as a gift. Make sure you use a plastic that has good closures. I usually present it, in its loaf pan, to keep freshness. Suggestion: maybe you can use bottle style bags to fit the pan in.

Granola Bars,"['          Tasted great. I subbed the honey for maple like it said you could. I cooked for 8 minutes so they could be chewy. Mine fell almost completely apart.

The texture to this dish is excellent, cooked for 20 minutes- it thickens slightly, as it sits for a few minutes, after completing.  Be sure to use a fork to fluff it after it is done since the rice tends to stick together when you add coconut milk.  I found it perfect just as written- in addition, you can add a few green onions to it to change it up if you think that would be something you'd enjoy.  Just a few!

"", ""          Needs a little less milk...not quite sure about that. May reduce it a bit or thicken the milk with some gelatin or cornstarch or use cream instead. As for the flavor, it's good.

I've done several variations of curry recipes over the last several months, and they all need a little tweaking. I also omit the broth, but don't drain my tomatoes and use that for the liquid instead. "", '          I added about 1.5 C of cauliflower (1/4 head), 1/2 sweet pepper chopped, about 1/2 C of baby carrots, additional 1/2 tsp of curry, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, additional can of chopped petite tomatoes undrained. Added liquid reserved from previous can of chopped tomatoes. More like a soup. Still enjoyed the flavors and consistency. Although next time around, I will drain both cans of tomatoes to see how the consistency turns out.  Four chicken breasts were used. I topped with a dollop of non fat Greek yogurt and chopped cilantro.  Will definitely be going back to this recipe. ', '           First time making Thai inspired, I did change a few things after reading other reviews..', '          This tastes perfect.  I believe the next time that I make it, I will use my submersion blender while the chicken is out for shredding.  This will thicken the liquid portion up.  Also, I thought that I had coconut milk in the pantry.  I did not.  So, I went to the liquor cabinet and used a can of Coco Lopez (Lite) and it tastes great! ', '          Delicious! This was the best curry dish that I have made thus far. Thank you ']"
Coconut Lime Rice,"['          Easy to prepare and delicious! We served it with jerk chicken at our last dinner party and it was a hit. Even the 18-month old ate a lot of it.

I am not a fan of rice, and living in Guatemala, all I can get is white rice.  Sometimes, only pre-cooked rice.  But I soldiered on with this using plain white rice, and had to replace the coconut oil with butter, but otherwise followed this exactly as written.  This was a huge hit among lunch guests.  The flavors were not really strong, but the creaminess from the coconut milk, with the tartness of the fresh limes was refreshing, very different and delicious.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe so I can have  some more for dinner.  Make this. ""]"

I would most definitely make it again. ', '          This was delicious! I had half a can of coconut milk left over and was scouting Allrecipes for a way to put it to use.

I brought the coconut milk and water to a gentle boil (barely looked like boiling) with the lid on the pot - took about 20 minutes.

Creamy Coconut Milk Rice Pudding,"['          Wow! This blend of flavors is incredible.  I did not have whole milk, so used almond milk instead.

This turned out pretty well, although I did follow the advice of others and cut the sugar by half. Even then it was a touch on the sweet side. Also, I cut back on the spices. To be honest, I think I liked it best just before adding the spices. The next time I make it I will just sprinkle cinnamon on the portions of people who want it. Finally, I found that after 18 minutes, my rice was not yet the right texture. I dumped in some more milk and cooked it for another ten minutes. That was the right amount of time for my rice to become the perfect texture.

Others have said they cut the sugar in half, but I thought maybe that was overkill, so I cut down to 1c, which is cutting by 1/3.  And that was 3/4 cup turbinado sugar with 1/4c white sugar, because I thought I might not care for all turbinado.  It's borderline too sweet, so next time I make it I'll indeed cut back to 3/4c.  Also, a quarter-cup of butter seemed like a lot, so I used only 3T and it tastes fine."", '          Very good flavor, except it didn‚Äôt set up like a pudding after chilling it.

I used a food processor to chop the oats fine, added the sugar, cocoa, and 1/3 c coconut (to hide from family that claim not to like it). When I added the other ingredients, it was not doughy. So I added more coffee. And more coffee. I'm guessing I added about 1/2c coffee until it became doughy. It easily scooped with a melon baller. Strangely, while we all liked them, none of us thought it tasted much like coffee.

Willard Family German Chocolate Cake,"['          I have been making this recipe for 30 plus years. Looked all over Allrecipes at different variations and found lots of  ""German"" chocolate cakes that quite frankly should just be called a Chocolate cakes. So I decided to go back to the original recipe. Glad I did! The last time i had made this was in 2019 at my Mom\'s request for her 89th birthday.  It has been a while and I was at her house with her baking pans and she greased and floured them. So please take note, it is somewhat of a fragile layer so Grease, flour and parchment and spray parchment and cocoa the top. That time it came out in so many pieces we had to glue it back together with the amazing  frosting laughing all the time, no one suspected it was so broken. So lesson learned last night i made it again and OMG no wonder it has stayed in my mind as one of my most favorite. No corners cut it is absolutely  moist, light, and delicious. Worh the effort ', '          The only change made was I doubled the icing!! This is a BIG family favorite!!! ', '           So moist and so fluffy.

It crumbles easy but I am not a baker and I could have over mixed or something.  But it was very moist and not too sweet!!  The frosting was barely enough to cover the three layers but that was ok by me for it was just enough sweetness.  If I make again I Will double  the frosting for to be sure each layer was fully covered and more for sides.  But definitely making it again! ', '          This was a great cake to make from scratch.  I also think more chocolate would be good but I added pieces of moist chocolate brownie to add chocolate.   The icing is to die for.  But a tip for some maybe is ‚Äúcook the icing for the exact time in medium after bringing it to a boil.  I freeze my cakes in order to ice them as it helps to keep them firm while decorating.  With a warm icing it cools it quickly so it doesn‚Äôt slide off.  I noticed in some pictures this happened.  I put the icing into a cool bowl; beat it with electric beater and then onto cake.  Worked beautifully.   I made a 9x11x2 cake (x2) plus doubled icing and still didn‚Äôt have enough for the sides.  I used chocolate ganache for layers.  I‚Äôd triple the icing to ensure the cake is covered.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I‚Äôll use it again (making my own adjustments to make it mine ‚Ä¶ üòÇ). ', ""           Made this cake for my BFs birthday and it was hands down THE best cake I've ever had. Ran out of frosting and had to use a can of chocolate for the sides, so be prepared. ""]"
Coconut Cream Pound Cake,"['          Do not make this as a tube or bundt cake. The cake isn‚Äôt bad, but is dry. It‚Äôs very fluffy but will benefit from frosting.

I started baking it for 30 minutes and then testing every 2 minutes after for maybe 10-12 more minutes. I found the cake dry and crumbly so not sure what the answer is-also add canola or vegetable oil? It had a really good flavor but the texture bothered me. Maybe I cooked it too long but the middle still seemed jiggly so I‚Äôd leave it in for a couple more minutes. ']"

Add just enough of the combined liquid only until mixture comes together to form a biscotti-like dough.  I used 1-1/4 cups of sweetened coconut flakes and 1 cup currants as well.

Anzac Biscuits (Australian Coconut-Oat Cookies),"['          I made this exactly as printed.  I think it should have had 2 cups of oatmeal rather than the 1 as printed.

Unfortunately, I was limited with time and the store I had a moment to get to didn\'t have it. So I went with what a Google search told me was a same/same sub of honey.

Thank you for all the helpful reviews! ', '          I ended up making these for an Australian-themed pot luck. I had never tried them before or heard of them before Googling Australian recipes, but I have to say that these cookies were delicious. I ended up ordering the golden syrup from an online retailer because I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd be able to find it locally, which worked out just fine.I did read through the reviews before making these, and I‚Äôm glad I did, because I flattened the cookies before baking with the bottom of a measuring cup and only baked them for 10 minutes, and I feel they were perfect.

Still delicious.EVERYONE asks for this recipe!And I am requested to make it for every holiday! ', '          This was more like a white cake with tart cranberries melted in, if you like that. It‚Äôs a coffee cake and not a pie. The almond didn‚Äôt lend a nutty flavor at all, but it helped. Not very complex. Quite boring. Don‚Äôt bring to Thanksgiving. ', '          So very easy to make.

Baked Oatmeal,"['          Just made this in 9x13 pan and feel it could be done in a 11x7 dish.  I did cut brown sugar in half and was plenty sweet.  I would start checking it at 30-40 minutes.

Rhubarb and Strawberry Pie,"['           Absolutely delicious! I actually had enough filling from this recipe for two pies.

Not sure why people are having them come out watery. I made sure to wait for the pie to cool completely before cutting and it‚Äôs nice and thick! I don‚Äôt like sickly sweet so the sourness is 100% what I was going for, a bit like a Granny Smith apple level of sour. I didn‚Äôt do anything fancy with the crust.

Strawberry Spinach Salad,"[""          The salad I've had it before and like it, but the dressing it's just perfect. I follow the recipe to the dot, except that I omitted the onions.

You can mix the produce and nuts and add dressing when ready to eat and it can be reused over a couple of days.  Packs well for lunch if made in the morning. ', '          It was too sweet.

I used the 8 oz Cool Whip as others had suggested, completely dried the fruit, and froze the crust with filling one hour  before cutting, then added fruit after cutting. I used white granulated sugar and it turned out great. My only comment is that the time estimates on this recipe seem off. When you add in the time to make the crust, let it cool, make the filling, spreading the filling on the crust (which is NOT easy), cutting up and draining the fruit, I‚Äôd say even working as many steps as possible concurrently, this took a solid two to 2.5 hours.

But I added the orange juice glaze from Fruit Pizza II and that was GREAT.  My guys all said it was very good.  I made a '23' with kiwi slices, for a birthday, and filled in the rest with strawberry quarters, raspberries and blueberries.  They accused me of using it as a color blindness test, because nobody saw the 23 until I pointed it out, they all tried to figure what the red design was!

Strawberry Shortcake,"['          I opted not to use the 8‚Äù cake pan, and made 8 biscuit shortbreads. It took the same 15 mins to cook. Turned out exactly like I had hoped. Good consistency and taste. ', ""          This is exactly the taste when my grandma used to make it. The only change that I made from the recipe was I used Becel Buttery margarine instead of shortening. I don't know what the deal is about using the proper amount of baking powder, which does not aluminum in it, but it was fine. I would also think that adding vanilla would give it an entirely different taste, this is Shortcake birthday cake.

I followed the recipe exactly and, while 3 pints was too many strawberries, I was completely satisfied with the results. It was biscuit-y, but still definitely a cake.It didn't cut easily towards the bottom, and was not a stable cake, but the taste made up for it 100%.I recommend only using 2 or 2 1/2 pints of strawberries and adding a slight amount less sugar to them, as mine were extremely syrupy.I was concerned at first when I put the batter into the pan, thinking it wouldn't spread or rise well, but it did so perfectly.This is a great dessert for any occasion: it's easy to make and wonderfully tasty. "", ""          The recipe is perfect, just like my Grandma used to make. However, I assembled and served it like my Grandma did. I baked the shortcake in a loaf pan. After baking, and cooling slightly, I sprinkled the top with a dusting of sugar and allowed the shortcake to finish cooling. When serving, I cut the shortcake much like I would cut and serve a piece of cake. I then put the piece of shortcake In  bowl, covered it with the prepared strawberries ( and some of it's juice ), and covered that with desired amount of milk. When eating, break apart the piece of shortcake so that the shortcake can soak up some of the milk. The combination of shortcake, strawberries, and milk in a bowl make for a delicious treat. "", '           I did add one extra tsp sugar to shortcake and to the strawberries.  My pan was also 9 in so the cake is flatter than the recipe but it worked. Tasted great.

As the other reviewers noted, I only used 2 tsp baking powder instead of 4, 1/4 cup sugar, butter instead of shortening, and I used buttermilk instead of milk (had it in the fridge).

The Ultimate Berry Crumble,"['           So delicious!  This might be the best pie I ever ate.  Followed the recipe closely since it was my first time making it, although I didn\'t have unsalted butter, used salted butter & no extra salt instead.  Used a 9 1/2"" deep-dish pie pan with raspberries, blueberries, & blackberries.  I had an extra 1/2c or so of berries after rinsing them, so threw them in - glad I did.  It made a nice single layer in the pan.  After splitting the dough in half & sprinkling it on top, I had extra dough (?).  I didn\'t have any overflow after it started to bubble, another 5 minutes to brown the top, then removed it.  The 2t of cornstarch worked for me, I was able to slice it like a pie.

As they say, a definite keeper :>) ', ""          This was one of my staple desserts when I was a chef down in Lakeview Oregon a couple of years ago.

Since I don't always have all three types of berries suggested by Chef John, sometimes I replace some two by plums or a grated apple. This works out fine, though I would not skip raspberries. Also, the short cut of using self-raising flour (without salt and baking powder) works well, unless you confuse it with the usual flour... "", ""          This just did not taste good.

I only have one thing to say to those people that omitted the pinch of cayenne pepper‚Ä¶DON‚ÄôT! It‚Äôs very subtle but just what it needed to give it a little extra punch of flavor!

It‚Äôs definitely does not have enough fruit though and I‚Äôm not a huge fan of tons of fruit in my crumbles. 3 cups seemed to skimpy compared to the amount of crumble when you mixed it up. I doubled the filling  amount (6 cups, double lemon juice, double sugar etc). I also Replaced the white sugar with brown sugar in the crumble and added a dash of cinnamon. I Replaced brown butter in place of the regular butter (I use 1 cup brown butter as you tend to loose some butter when you brown it (brown then freeze, don‚Äôt use hot melted brown butter) . I also added oats to the second half of the crumble (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. I also add enough vinegar to make it more wet).  You can replace the 6 cups fruit with any variety you want. I‚Äôve done peach blueberry strawberry. Apple raspberry and blueberry etc. it‚Äôs absolutely divine the way I‚Äôve altered it! I highly recommend trying it my way as brown butter is life! Even if you don‚Äôt want brown butter as the comments suggested double the fruit amount. I‚Äôve made it like 5 times now my way lol.

White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake,"[""          This is, hands down, the best dessert recipe I've ever encountered. I've made it for years, following the recipe, and people go crazy for it. I use more Oreo crumbs for the crust, I melt the white chocolate (I use Nestle's chips) in the micro, I wrap the pan in foil before baking it in a water bath (no seepage). I'm usually happy with 50 minutes at 325. I've never had to let it sit in the cooling oven. I worry about overcooking. And I always use frozen raspberries and strain out the seeds.

It‚Äôs a fantastic recipe. I absolutely need one every morning with my coffee.After using this recipe for a couple months, I happen to have a biscotti that had an orange flavor to it. I thought that would be a good thing to add to this one and see how it would taste. I added 1/2  teaspoon of orange extract and about one 1/4-1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind after adding the eggs. That seem to be enough to add an orange flavor.  A few weeks later I decided I wanted more orange taste so I glazed them with an orange juice powered sugar glaze. Keep in mind my five star rating is before I started the change. Since there are no more stars,  it remains a five-star rating. A big THANKS to Gerry for sharing.

Strawberry Pie Filling,"['           Tasted wonderful and was well-received. Final product is runny but not overly so, with a consistency closer to syrup.

I did not use fresh strawberries, but frozen unsweetened ones. I ran out, and used 3/4 cup sweetened strawberry halves to add to the mashed mixture. I strained my sliced strawberries to get rid of the excess juice. I used the juice from the bag and from the mashed pulp. Didn't have to add water. I'm incorporating the pulp in my sweetened strawberry container to use in my punch bowl cake.

I did it this way because I didn‚Äôt want the bottom to be undercooked from being too liquidy.

Blueberry Simple Syrup,"['          As others have mentioned, this made a very thin syrup.

Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad,"['          TLDR: The dressing is too sweet so add less sugar and definitely add blue cheese crumbles.I was really unsure about the dressing. After a few hours in the fridge, I went to pour it onto the salad and the vinegar smell seemed overpowering, but it doesn‚Äôt taste overly vinegary. I love anything sweet, but the dressing was too sweet even for my taste, which I would‚Äôve thought was impossible. Next time, I‚Äôll cut down on the sugar. I added blue cheese crumbles and I can‚Äôt imagine the salad without them. They add a tang & saltiness that offsets the sweetness of the cranberries and dressing. I‚Äôll definitely make it again. ', ""          So I got this recipe from the allrecipes magazine for my bday and we love this salad! It's really yummy. One odd thing I've noticed is the web version and the magazine version are different in a few ways. The dressing calls only for 2 tbsp of the vinegars, sugar and only a 1/4 cup oil.

There is plenty of sweetness with the cranberries.  No need to add those empty calories. ', '          This is hands-down the best version of this salad I‚Äôve ever made. I think the secret is toasting the almonds, which really adds a depth of umami flavor to the whole thing. I made it exactly as written with the  exception of the poppy seeds, which I didn‚Äôt have on hand. Others have said that they drastically cut back on the sugar. I think the sweetness is needed, but the quantity of dressing was quite a bit more than I felt was needed for the amounts of the other ingredients. I made the dressing according to the recipe, dressed the salad with about 1/3 of the dressing and refrigerated the rest. It‚Äôs a matter of personal taste, of course, but I thought it was perfect that way. I‚Äôve made the salad two more times using the leftover dressing. Thank you for a delicious recipe! ', '          This is good just as it is written. I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds together, used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that‚Äôs what I had.

Date Balls,"['           I experienced frustration when the mixture would not adhere and form balls. I set it aside. I used some butter and marshmallows to finish before this went into the garbage.

I was thrilled to find this and eager to make a batch or three. I did make a few changes that I\'ll share in the hope it will help folks who are having problems with their cookies not holding together. Be SURE to use baking/cooking dates and use cooking shears to snip them into small pieces. I use butter rather than margarine, and I limit the Rice Krispies to one cup. I also use very very finely chopped pecans. When you go to make them into balls, don\'t try to roll them between your hands. You want to squeeze it as though it\'s an exercise ball, working it around in your hand until it makes a 1"" ball. You\'ll feel butter squeezing out between your fingers, but you also don\'t need to coat your hands with margarine! My mother always said these were a hybrid between candy and cookie - as they cool they become sticky like working with chewy buttery candy rather than a doughy cookie. When they\'re done they\'re tender and yummy kept at room temp. I hope you enjoy as much as my family always has!! ', '          I think you should specify baking or cooking chopped dates which are found in the baking aisle and come in a solid lump as people may not be aware of them.  I omitted the chopped pecans and used an extra up of crispy rice cereal.  I rolled my balls in shredded coconut instead of powdered sugar.  I was able to get 5 1/2 dozen from my single batch.  They taste wonderful.  Thank you for using an eggless recipe.  I think it makes them vegan.

Then let the caramel cool and drizzle the caramel over. Then sift powdered sugar over and top with chopped nuts. Oh, the other thing I'd change is to make the batter the day before and leave the nuts out, so that the raisins and dates can plump up and the spices can mingle. Then before you bake, add the nuts.

Devils on Horseback,"['           These were snatched up quickly at the party I brought them to. I loved the shiny mahogany glaze created by the soy/ginger/brown sugar combination.

Energy Balls without Peanut Butter,"[""           Really great little energy bites! Thoroughly enjoyed the flavor! When I've made energy balls in the past, I've never added additional sweetener--I usually just rely on the dates for that--so I only added a little at a time until I got the sweetness-level that I personally enjoy, and that allowed these to still be formed into balls (about a 1/4 cup total). My one issue with these was with the addition of the  mini chocolate chips. They did NOT want to stick into these things, and it was a fight to get them in there. I also couldn't imagine adding a full cup of them. I used a 1/4 cup and that seemed to be more than enough--but that could just be my taste preference as well. I also realized too late that I'd forgotten the raisins, but will definitely add them next time. Using a 1.5 tbsp scoop, this made 23 balls for me.

Couple things I would say - make sure you have the non pitted dates for sure. When I did this instead of putting a slice of almond, I use delivered almonds, then crushed, fried in a pan for about 5 minutes in a little bit of butter, gave it kind of a nice roasted flavor, and then insert that into each date, closed it back up, wrapped with bacon and then baked.""]"

Adding more dry ingredients and syrup was the trick. I rolled them into balls. Turned out fantastic! Taste like a Larabar bite! ', '          The taste was great... but this didn‚Äôt give me bars. It gave me crumbles.. what am i missing that would allow this to firm up in the fridge.. after 2 hours i still had crumbles. ', '          Sweet without sugar! ']"
Great-Grandma Cathy's Date Loaf Candy,"['          My mother made this when I was a kid and I have been looking for the recipe for years.  Thank you. ', '          Very good! Reminds me of pralines. I used parchment paper instead of the cheesecloth & it worked fine. My roll did crumble too much. Next time I will put in a square pan & cut like fudge. ', '           My grandmother uses to make this candy for us and it was very decadent. I was happy to find this recipe. Mine turned out a bit harder than hers, but tased the same. I need to use a candy thermometer next time and stop the heat just at soft ball and increase the flavor by one half. ', ""          My grandma Odom use to make this candy . and my mom  and aunt also  made it every year. They would  put it out side in a damp clothes in the cold snow to harden. Now  I make it for my kid's and grand kid's.if it does not set up you just get a spoon and dig in.I'm so glad to hear this  is still around with other family's. "", '          I could not get the wet cotton dish towel off the candy roll after cooling. ', '          I gave it three stars because I\'m not an experienced candy maker so I may have messed it up myself, but especially for someone inexperienced I feel the directions could be clarified some. I was not sure what heat setting to use, and then the wording made it sound like you don\'t stir the mixture while it boils for possibly as long as 20 minutes... I ""cheated"" and stirred it just a few times because I was really skeptical about not stirring a boiling candy mixture at all (but tried to follow the directions since I figured maybe the recipe was written that way for a reason). The result was burned sugar coating the bottom of my pan that was as hard as a rock and was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to remove. It took at least a half hour of constant scrubbing and scraping. Probably longer. The candy is edible but has a burned sugar taste. It\'s not terrible I guess, but also does not taste like my grandma\'s date roll candy. Afterward I looked around more and have seen other recipes that say to stir constantly. I\'m not sure if I misunderstood these directions, but please clarify them or reconsider the whole ""without stirring once the boiling begins"" part. I will use a different recipe next time and be sure to stir! ']"
Power Cookies,"['          I make these as bars and they are wonderful!  I use either craisins or raisins depending on what I have in the cupboard. ', '          I was intrigued by this recipe, so tonight I gave it a try. I didn\'t have cannellini beans, so I used the 1 1/2 cups of black beans I had on hand (maybe black beans are vastly different from cannellini \'cause my recipe could have been a disaster),  When I got to the end, the ""dough"" was no dough I\'ve ever seen. It literally would not hold together. I added 2 beaten eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, which saved the day. Oh, yeah, I snuck in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, too. And we don\'t like honking big cookies so I got 63 cookies at about 20-23 grams each. They are about 66 calories each. I\'m happy. ', '          I made the recipe as printed, with dried figs instead of dates. A bit dry and crumbly, so I added an egg and a 1/3 c of egg whites. Much better.....for the last few batches, I added dark chocolate chips....quite the cookie!!! made more than 18. ', '           really tasty you don‚Äôt even notice the beans!! but i added applesauce and 1/2 cup milk which was definitely needed ', '           really tasty you don‚Äôt even notice the beans!! but i added applesauce and 1/2 cup milk which was definitely needed ', '          these were very good for a "" healthy"" treat. They were also easy to make. I used 1-15 oz. can of navy beans, rinsed as that was what I had in the cupboard. After reading the reviews, I also used 1- 15 oz. unsweetened applesauce to give the cookies moisture. I feel that you can pretty much add whatever add ins you want. I used coconut, dried cranberries, and mini chocolate chips. ', '           Edit to my earlier review‚Äîit said to ground the oats. My bad. Guess I will have to try again :) ', ""          Followed recipe exactly and they were way too dry. They wouldn't even hold together into a ball to bake. I had to throw the whole thing out. What a waste of time and money! "", '          The cookie dough was too dry.  I added 4 oz. of almond milk to the recipe and the cookies turned out great. Great tasting snack. ']"
Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice),"['           Such a easy dish, this definitely pleases the whole family!! ']"
Paleo Almond Date Cookies,"[""          I'm sorry but I found these to be tasteless.  I also added molasses and an extra egg to help with how dry it was.  I don't think I missed anything.  Reread the recipe to make sure I followed it perfectly.  Maybe alter it to your own liking.  I like how they were sugar free though. "", '           They look beautiful! I used honey instead of maple syrup, and added some slivered almonds just because I could. ', '          First time I made them I added some non-sweetened coconut and replaced extract with 1tsp vanilla and 2tsp almond extract. They were a huge hit at the party! ', ""           Dang these are delicious! I can't make any recipe without messing with it just a bit so I subbed 1/2 cup of golden flax flour and since I'm not really watching calories or sugar I added a touch more maple syrup. Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb. "", '          was nice and quick to do given you have the ingredients. I searched for almond flour dates recipes... this was very intriguing and tastes amazing given no added sugar ', '           They tasted good but were quite crumbly. I might try pur√©ed dates next time. ', ""          I was looking for a simple date cookie recipe that didn't include sugar... and though I don't need gluten-free nor paleo, this cookie turned out amazingly! I followed the baking instructions exactly and the cookies were slightly crispy on the bottom/edges and perfectly flaky (not too dry) in the middle. For the recipe, I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I omitted the cherries, walnuts, maple syrup, vanilla... it was still perfect! I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe! "", '           These were delicious. I didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them! Great recipe to use as a base for other flavors. ', '           Followed the recipe as written. These turned out very moist and delicious! I brought them to work and my coworkers raved over them and asked for the recipe. ']"
Date-Nut Balls,"['          I love this recipe!  Been making these since I was a child!  My family and friends love them. ', '           I changed the nuts to roasted pistachios, and coated with conf. sugar and coconut.', '          I‚Äôve made what we call Pecan Date Balls for about 25 years. This year I tried this recipe and it was a complete fail. No matter how hard I push and pressed, the mixture would not form into a ball, it just crumbled. My recipe calls for an egg, which helps bind the mixture. This recipe I tried today seemed to have far too much butter. The mixture was flavorless to me. I read back over this recipe thinking I may have missed something, but I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll stick to my family recipe. ', '          About 5 minutes into cooking the sugar and dates (on medium heat) I got worried, but was determined to follow the recipe. At 9 minutes i thought ""this can\'t be right, it is going to be like toffee"", and took it off the burner and stirred the other ingredients in. Tasted great while hot, but when I rolled it into balls and they cooled they became too hard to even bite into. It took serious boiling of water, vinegar and baking soda to get the cooled mess off my pan!  Joyce do you really cook this for 10-15 minutes? ', ""          Very good! One of several treats I put together as Christmas gifts  this year. I remembered my mom always made these around Christmas so when I saw this recipe I had to try it out. They tasted so good and they're really easy to make. No baking involved! I used my Magic Bullet to chop up the dates and nuts so it was super quick. ""]"
Jamaica Cake,"['          Liked the taste of the cake, but it stuck to the pan that I baked it in.  :-(  Next time I will mix it in another bowl,  grease cake pan  and then pour batter into pan.  Then I will be happy! ', '          Really good and very easy. I used 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup dk brown sugar plus 1/2 cup golden sugar, around 1/2 cup sweetened coconut mixed in and a little over 1 tsp cinnamon plus about 1/2 Tb vanilla.  I did mash the bananas. Very similar to hummingbird cake but much easier. I added the cream cheese frosting II from this site. My husband doesn‚Äôt like pineapple in baked goods but even he liked it. ', '          Although very tasty, About 12oz too much pineapple compared to similar recipes. Did not bake completely in the center. ', '          I did as others divided white and brown sugar. I add vanilla, Almond and cocnut extract. 1c of oil and 1/2c applesauce. ', '           We had a Jamacian good night and I made this and it was a hit, my sisters and family loved it. The only change I made was half brown sugar like other people did. Will make again ', '          I took the advice of others and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and reduced the oil to 1c. I think the cake is delicious, but felt like it needed a frosting so I did a light layer it cream cheese frosting. That was a game changer and took the cake to a whole new level of delicious. I will definitely make it again. It‚Äôs a nice change. ', ""          Heavier texture than a cake, but flavors were nice.  Everyone liked it. I told them it was 'bread'! "", '          Delicious and simple. I had to use up a surplus of broken almonds. I agree with others and will add one banana and reduce the oil and sugar next time to suit our tastes.  This makes a  sheet cake. ', '          Enjoyed this cake and loved how easy it is to make and clean up. ']"
Best Hot Sauce,"['           Excellent! Added extra parsley and basil with Aji Lemon drop peppers. It came out extra green. ', '          My son is from West Africa and pepper sauce is a traditional sauce there. I left out the dates and added a little fresh ginger root. Turned out great! ', '           Love the taste. I bottled and shrink wrapped 2 bottles. How long will it last if not in the fridge? Kept 2 out to eat myself lol, gifting the other 2 to fellow hot sauce lovers. And I doubled the pepper count, I like it hot! ', '           Yes I will make it again /substituted a fourth of a teaspoon lemon pepper and two tbls of white vinegar instead of lemon juice. I used pitted plumbs instead of dates and used half the amount of chili peppers. I reduced the oil on my second batch to 1/3 cup of smooth olive oil ', ""          Great recipe Shiloh, thanks for posting. As you suggested this is a fun recipe to experiment with. Each time I make it I change the ingredients a bit but never stray too far from the basic hot/sweet combination. It's always been very enjoyable and gets positive comments from everyone who tastes it. "", ""           This was very tasty!! For me, as-is needed a few things. And its Feb so peppers are obviously not in season. Im sure with peppers straight out of my garden it'd be better. "", ""          It was AMAZING. I doubled the recipe, used Santa Fe Grande peppers instead of chili peppers because I'm a wimp, and threw in a couple extra dates and an extra garlic clove or two. Used Minors Beef Base instead of beef boullion because that's what I had on hand.. It's wonderful on rice and beans, or on anything that you just want a yummy condiment. I'll make it again, maybe with a slightly hotter pepper or two thrown in.  Reminded me a bit of HP steak sauce but without the hint of vinegar. "", '          Delicious way to use end of season over abundance of habaneros and santa fe  peppers.  No dates but dried cranberries as substitute did great.  Keeping it fresh too.  Tasted so good I thought cooking might mess it up.  Will not last too long at my house. ', ""           My goodness this stuff is good and addictive. I had fragments of each of these ingredients hanging around so I whipped up a mini portion to put them to use. I did use my own measurements as written in the notes but stuck to the ratios of the ingredients. I used vegan bouillon with nutritional yeast instead of beef. The aroma alone will entice you. I put it on baked tofu and it stole the show. There isn't one particular taste that stands out. It is simply a mix of flavours that accent the chile peppers. I used scotch bonnets for the principal peppers and added a large piece of a roma tomato. I can see where this would go well with everything. Definitely a staple to have around the table. Thank you Shilo for this recipe. ""]"
Moist Date Nut Bread,"['          I made this delicious bread and shared it at my church this  morning after service.  It was an instant hit! Moist, tasty, totally satisfying. I plan to make it  again soon. THANK YOU! ', '          The best, easy to prepare, moist and not too sweet absolutely  delicious! ', '          I loved it!  You have got to really enjoy dates and walnuts to appreciate this bread. ', '           Delicious! My husband and I both loved it! The only change I made to this recipe was to use 2 eggs instead of 1. ', '          This recipe is great! I made some changes, and it was still good. I made a puree of the soaked dates and soaking water, then I mix the eggs into the blender. I left out the sugar because the dates were sweet enough for me. I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and added the puree. After baking, I added some finishing salt to the top and it balanced the flavor even more. ', '          Wonderful!  I had two bananas to use up and was a little short on dates, so I mashed them and added in with the egg and brown sugar.  Perhaps for that reason I baked it for 1 hour.  Will make again with enough dates this time. ', '          I have been looking so long for a Date Nut bread that reminded me of one we used to buy in the store so long ago. This one is very close. I added 1 tsp of vanilla,  but that really  was not necessary.  A very good dense bread. I eat it cold from the fridge with cream cheese.  So good. ', '           Perfection! Just like I remember my mom making. I took two suggestions from reviewers and used a cup of hot coffee to soak the dates instead of water. And I wrapped the loaf hot from the oven in waxed paper and tin foil and put it into my fridge. It took all of my self control to wait until the next morning to taste it. Heavenly with cream cheese slathered on top! Absolutely will be my go-to recipe. ', '          This bread is SO moist.  I have made it over and over again! ']"
Chef John's Chocolate Energy Bars,"['          These were so good! I did about three tablespoons of espresso, and that was perfect.  I wished I had white chocolate to drizzle on top, but they were good enough without.  I didn‚Äôt even regret the loss of my adored medjool dates into the recipe. üòä  I also did two cups of almonds and one of cashews out of necessity, and I think it was better than it would been the other way.   My family and I ate most of them right away.Certainly recommendüòã ', '          These are delicious! There is the perfect combination of sweet and nutty.

I love this because its healthier and taste pretty similar to a brownie with nuts! ', '          Super yummy and easy. I added some shredded coconut on top for a twist. ', '          Delicious!!!! ', '          Just made these.  Wanted to sit down with a spoon and eat the whole batch.  I followed the recipe, and roasted both nuts prior to grinding in food processor. So chocolaty delicious! ', '          I make this often and give to friends as special treats. I don\'t make them in bars, rather, I make 1 Tbs balls. They hold together much better if you roll them in your hands and put them into the fridge to set.  I\'ve made the recipe ""as is"" a lot and have never had a problem with them holding together. ', '          Delicious and so easy as written! ', ""          These things are excellent!  I used Brazil nuts and Macadamia nuts instead of what the recipe called for.  Also added in half a cup of dried cherries.   Also used Cold Brew versus Espresso and didn't seem to phase how good it came out. Beyond Excellent stuff....more addictive than Oreos!!!""]"
