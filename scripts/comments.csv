Apple-Cranberry Crostada,"['          husband loved it ! ', ""           Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner. "", '           This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! ', '          Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning. ', '          I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make ', '          Didn\'t have much flavor to the ""filling"".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart. ']"
Apple Pie by Grandma Ople,"['          I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It‚Äôs a keeper! ', '          Go to recipe for all holidays!

Sarah's Homemade Applesauce,"['          Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples ', '          Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough. ', '          Yum good easy ', '          Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it! ', ""          I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too. "", ""          Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again. "", '          Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn‚Äôt made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again! ', ""          I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER! "", ""           Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much. ""]"
Apple Crisp,"['          Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum! ', '          It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water. ', '          I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it‚Äôs in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought ', ""           I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe! "", '          Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream! ', '          Very very good as is.  Used glass dish. ', '          the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!! ', '          Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious. ', '          Love it! ']"
Apple Pie Filling,"['          I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again. ', '          I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better. ', ""          5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great! "", '          Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect. ', ""          This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using. "", ""          no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half. "", '          Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies ', '          I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome ', '          Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my ""go to"" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp. ']"
Easy Apple Crisp with Oat Topping,"['          I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!! ', '          I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it. ', '          Made it in a 9x13"" pan (9"" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe. ', '          Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream. ', ""          I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!! "", '          easy to make and my friends all loved it!! ', '          Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect. ', '          My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-))) ', ""          Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious! ""]"
Easy Apple Cider,"['          Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving. ', ""           Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!! "", '          I don‚Äôt even like cider but this was AMAZING!!! ', '          I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self. ', '          You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good! ', ""          I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd "", '          Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange ', ""          This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good! "", ""          I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high. ""]"
Apple-Cranberry Crisp,"['          Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect. ', '          My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!! ', '          Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples) ', ""          Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out. "", '          Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.  ', '          Love, Love, Love! ', '          I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.

Old-Fashioned Apple Dumplings,"['          I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS! ', '          I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream! ', '          I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they‚Äôre in the oven now and I can‚Äôt wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I‚Äôve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G ', '          Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm. ', '          I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this ""apple rings"". ', '          Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough ', '          Smells amazing!! ', '           Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn‚Äôt used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!! ', '          Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty. ']"

Apple Turnovers,"['           These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.

', '           I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. ', '          Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples. ', ""          I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious! "", '          These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious! ', ""          Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group. "", '           I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don‚Äôt hold enough filling.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed . "", '           I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my ""appeal"" factor.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è ', '           Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i‚Äôm sure less butter would do the trick ', '          Carmel just slid off ', '          Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again. ', '          This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn‚Äôt have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed. ', '          The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have ""helpers"" in the kitchen, but I\'m so happy! ']"

This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup! ']"
Sauteed Apples,"['          Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish. ', '          I have used this for years as written.

This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream. ', ""          My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you "", '           FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider. "", '           This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect! ', ""          Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps! "", ""          Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again. ', '          Delicious.

Canned Apple Pie Filling,"['          Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.

German Apple Cake,"['          This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples. "", '          I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch. "", '          I would use less nutmeg ', ""          This recipe did not turn out well for me.

I'll look for another baked apple recipe.

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too. ']"
Waldorf Salad,"[""          My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.

I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color.

When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.

Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples.

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice.

Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed . "", '           I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.

The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i‚Äôm sure less butter would do the trick ', '          Carmel just slid off ', '          Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again. ', '          This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn‚Äôt have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed. ', '          The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have ""helpers"" in the kitchen, but I\'m so happy! ']"

Again, thank you "", '           FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps! "", ""          Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe! "", ""          Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

Canned Apple Pie Filling,"['          Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.

That was a good idea. ', '           This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in! "", ""           I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it. "", '          Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.

They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe! ']"

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

The Best Caramel Apples,"[""          So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color.

It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe! ', '          I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.

Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe. ', '           Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples.

I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I‚Äôll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).

Homemade Apple Cider,"[""          I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it.

I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned.

I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity! "", '          Simple, easy and everyone loved it.

That was a good idea. ', '           This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.

Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!! ', '          German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe‚ÄîUse 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the ‚Äúoily sloppy mess‚Äù issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don‚Äôt like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake‚Äîsprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time‚ÄîI cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it‚Äôs always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn‚Äôt high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won‚Äôt burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it‚Äôll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick ‚Äúraw batter‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone! ', '           Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can‚Äôt go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease. ', ""          The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting. "", ""          I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.

The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.

Debbie's Amazing Apple Bread,"[""          This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.

I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.

Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in! "", ""           I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it. "", '          Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf. ', '          This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe! ']"

Delicious Cinnamon Baked Apples,"[""          I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top.

I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite! "", ""          DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter...

Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low.

Since the apple sauce was hot, I folded it in after I mixed the wet and dry ingredients and folded in the cubed apples afterwards. A few other adjustments I made (but weren't necessary! just felt like doing it) was sprinkled some pumpkin spice blend (I'd say about 1/4 tsp) into the dry mix and I used two cut up apples for the fresh apples at the end - mainly because I wanted to get rid of them all before everything started to rot ;) Thank you so much to the maker of this recipe!

Apple Oatmeal Crisp,"['          This was good, but a little dry.  I made a syrup using butter brown sugar an a little white sugar, and added some cinnamon.  Mad it in microwave.

Veronica's Apple Pancakes,"['          I made these this morning and they were fantastic! Easy fast recipe. Pancakes fluffed up nicely. Just the right amount of apple flavor and not too sweet.

Plus, the pancakes even looked as good as they tasted. ', '          I altered this recipe based on the prior reviews I doubled the cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white.

Great for gifts: put dry goods in a jelly jar and put an apple on top with a bow.  Will make again!! ', ""          the first time i made these, last autumn, i thought they were pretty bland - but i had a cold and figured it was from that.  Made them again today and they were still bland.  They need some salt and some more cinnamon and maybe some other spices -allspice, nutmeg, ginger...  We made some apple compote to have with them and that made them pop.  They're quite dense and filling - we did not eat anywhere near as many as we thought we would. ""]"
Spiced Applesauce Bread,"[""          I think this is a very flexible recipe.

Baked Apple Roses,"[""           Came out perfectly! Baked at 375 for 40 minutes with foil on top the entire time. Really helped to keep the color and prevent the apples from browning.

Someone suggested using melted vanilla ice cream so I told that route.  Oh My...it was diViNe! ', '          This recipe has potential but MUCH too sweet the way it is! Even my kids said so! It could have done with 1/2 c brown sugar in the bread and apple mixture. I made it with leftover brioche which was very nice. Baked for 45 min, perfect consistency.  I used half the amount of sugar for the sauce and 1/4 cup heavy cream + 1/4 cup milk which added a richness to the sauce!  Will try it again but with half the amount of sugar next time. ']"

Instant Pot Meatloaf,"[""          I love allrecipes! I typically read through reviews and adjust the recipe hear and there. This recipe had very few recommendations so I stuck pretty close.  I used panko because it's what I had and added about 1-2 TBS fresh chopped parsley because it needed to be used.  Doubled the sauce.  I used a bundt pan (with 1 C water in pot) instead of loaf shape in foil. Cooked for 25 minutes and NR.

Easy Apple Coleslaw,"['          I made this for Easter today.

First, the recipe calls for an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings. It appears by most photos that everyone used a larger can by how many pineapple rings are on their cakes.  I could not find an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings so purchased a Dole 20 oz. can (in heavy syrup) and measured out what would be 8 oz. which turned out to be 4 pineapple rings and about 1/3 cup of juice. (That kinda makes no sense because now I needed 2/3 cup of milk and she calls for 1/4 cup or as needed - this seems like a big leap but that's ok - I did use 2/3 cup of milk to bring that to 1 cup). I did decide to use another couple of pineapple rings from the  can because it looked too sparse just using 4 which didn't seem to make any difference in the end anyway. Secondly, the recipe calls for an 18.25 oz boxed yellow cake mix.  What I found was 15.25 oz. Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. Could this be the reason why so many cakes are coming up with too much moisture?  Maybe. Thirdly, like many others at 40 minutes a wooden skewer showed that my cake was still not baked through.  I left it another 10 minutes (a total of 50 minutes) and then it was done perfectly.  Making those changes though - made an absolutely terrific Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt¬Æ Cake! Couldn't give it the 5 stars I wanted to for all of the diversions I had to make to the original recipe buts it was 5 stars after my changes.  I hope that helps some others!

', '          A couple of notes about this recipe; first the baking time is off, most bundt cakes need at least an hour of bake time. Second, I think the amount of butter for the topping needs to be reduced, maybe 1/4 cup would work better as this is not being baked in the traditional cast iron or 9x13 pan. I dried my pineapple and cherries before putting them in the pan. Hope this helps. I will definitely make it again, it‚Äôs delicious and look beautiful. ', ""          Beautiful and delicious!

Thirty Day Friendship Cake,"[""          I use 6 foil loaf pans to bake then and I  use toothpick method, about 50 mins. that way you can put them in ziplock bags for freezer after they cool in their pans.

Remove from bag (if you want) and at that time of year you can usually find decorative plastic bags to put it in as a gift. Make sure you use a plastic that has good closures.

Old Time Mincemeat Pie,"[""           I did make it... Followed the posted recipe as closely as possible. Unable to find currants, I used a mix of dried dates and dried cranberries as a substitute. Not sure why the recipe calls for reserving the liquid from the sour cherries (then never has it used).Turned out pretty good. Wasn't too difficult. The recipe made enough for two pies. I baked one pie and froze the rest of the mix for another pie. "", '           This is a great pie to make, but it takes planning.    A bit of advice for the next baker, for the round steak, ask the butcher to grind it up like hamburger (run through grinder 3 times).  This will save you a huge step and eliminate the chopping after cooking the meat.  I also recommend making your own candied citrus peel.  This is another step in advance that can take 2-3 days for the peel to dry, but well worth it.  I used a combination of grapefruit, lemons, limes and oranges.  There are many recipes on-line and best way to peel the fruit is to use a kitchen potatoe peeler to take the peel off the fruit, otherwise it is a challenge, now that I did it the other way.  Enjoy! ', '          I have never had real mincemeat pie before so I wanted to try this, and am very glad I did.  The taste was so much better than the stuff in the jar.  I would recommend serving it warm with whipped cream on top. ', '          I have a questions about this pie before making/rating it; hopefully, someone knows the answer.  The recipe says to make the mincemeat several weeks in advance and a couple reviewers said they did so a month ahead.  My question is this:  does the meat get preserved in all the sugar and fruit?  I worry about the meat spoiling from being in the frig that long.  Thanks for any help you can give. ', '          In the past, I detested mincemeat because I have only had the kind that comes in a jar. This time, I decided to try to make some from scratch, as my son and daughter-in-law asked me to for their Victorian style Christmas dinner (they are experimenting with old-fashioned meals; they no doubt thought that Mom should experiment, too). I chose this recipe because it was rated highly--I found out for good reason! ', '          My husband loves mincemeat pies. I cannot even stomach the thought of one, and almost gagged when I opened a store bought jar of the stuff. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I followed some other reviews and made it a month ahead of time and doubled the recipe. I made no other changes. It smelled wonderful when I would stir it weekly. I made traditional mince pies (mini pies) for Thanksgiving and only made a dozen, thinking no one but my husband would eat them. I was so wrong! They were delish! Hearty, spicy and sweet! I made another two dozen and had plenty of mincemeat left over for Christmas. I froze the rest of the mincemeat and made another two dozen for Christmas. This is now a regular recipe for us. Thanks so much for giving us a new and delicious family tradition! ', '          I made this pie for my parents on Thanksgiving.  They love mincemeat pie but. I one has made it since my grandma passed away!  This did not taste like hers but several times that day my dad commented how good the pie was!  It certainly is. Or a cheap pie to make but it. Was worth seeing the smiles my parents had on their faces! ', ""          I ended up making the candied orange and lemon peelfrom scratch (other stuff full of chemicals). I saved the orange syrup and added 1/2 cup to the mincemeat mixture then reduced the white sugar to 1 scant cup. OMG so deeeelish. This pie has a wonderful full, rich flavor. I can't stop tasting it. "", ""          I don't know much about mincemeat pie, but I do have to say this recipe was scrumptious! ""]"
Baked Ham with Sweet Glaze,"[""          Best ham glaze I've ever had. I followed the directions as written. This one is a keeper! "", '           I followed recipe to the letter.

Fresh Cherry Muffins,"[""          As directed, the batter comes out thicker then a pie crust dough. I added some water since I ran out of mil and hoped for the best.

They were fantastic and I‚Äôll be using the basic recipe with other fruits in the future. ', ""          These are fantastic! The texture and taste is fabulous. I did need to add extra milk to thin out the batter, as other reviewers have mentioned. I used almond milk instead of milk, and avocado oil for the vegetable oil (just what i keep in house). i will say that i even messed up and didn't use enough cherries, because i didn't have as many as i thought i had, and the muffins are still delicious. even the loser muffins at the end that had like no cherries were good. i definitely recommend using the almond extract as the recipe recommends. can't wait to make this again with the appropriate amount of cherries! yum! oh one more thing - i doubled the recipe and got a yield of 15 muffins (i think i overfilled the muffin tin but they still turned out great). "", '          I will use less cherries next time, probably 3/4 cup. ', '          Made it vegan by using 1/4 cup applesauce instead of egg and almond milk instead of cows milk. ', '          Changed up a bit. Used 1/2 whole wheat pancake mix and regular flour. Added one large smashed banana. And 1 teaspoon vanilla. ', '          When I started to make this recipe, I realized that the batter was the same as I use for To Die for Blueberry Muffins with streusel topping - my favorite muffin recipe. This recipe has a foolproof method of measuring the correct amount of wet ingredients which seems to be a problem for some who have tried this recipe. Add 1/3 cup oil to a liquid measuring cup. Add the egg and use a fork to break up the egg and blend the egg and oil. Fill the cup to the 1 cup line with milk and stir the liquid. Add any flavorings you like such as vanilla or almond. This method seems to provide the correct amount of wet ingredients and I have never had a bad turnout with the recipe. This version with sweet cherries was outstanding. ']"
Easy Fruit Cobbler,"['          Sometimes you just need something fast. I made it twice, once with canned peaches and once with frozen berries.

Recipe didn‚Äôt say whether or not to peel the peaches, so I didn‚Äôt.  I had some peaches to use up, threw in a few strawberries, and this was a totally simple recipe to make, almost like a dump cake.  I also think canned peaches would work well in this, as we head out of  peach season. ', ""          This is just like my mother's peach cobbler recipe from the 1960s. It's perfect without a single change and everybody loves it.  My mother's recipe calls for 3/4 cup flour rather than 1 cup, but otherwise is identical.  I've made it with fresh peaches, fresh blueberries and canned peaches, and all are equally delicious.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream is almost essential! ""]"

Everyone in my house (and some family who was here when I made them) agreed that the frosting was too sweet and eventually we decided to omit it completely. (And it does make WAY too much frosting!)

Baked Fresh Cherry Pie,"[""          It's so good!

If I were to make this again, I‚Äôd bake in an 8‚Äù springform pan and then be prepared to cook longer.

Chef John's Classic Rice Pudding,"['          This was delicious, so creamy and yummy. I did add a bit more sugar, and I added cardamom powder to mine as well.

BC Cherry Jam,"[""          I made this last year.  I didn't have powdered pectin, only liquid.

Instead of using 4 ounces, if you use 2 packages you are only using  3.5 ounces.  #2  The directions ask for 3 cups pitted, chopped fresh cherries...I use a kitchen scale, so when you pit the cherries they will weigh less.  3 cups of pitted Bing cherries is 675 grams...you may be measuring with the pits IN...the directions want the measurement of already pitted cherries.  Pit then measure...If you don\'t have one, do yourself a BIG favor...get yourself a scale that measures grams and ounces and then some...it makes it much easier in figuring out recipes...  I learned this from bread baking...weights do make a difference in accuracy...Hope this helps... ', ""          I really liked this recipe! Cooked up very well and preserved nicely.

Paleo Almond Date Cookies,"[""          I'm sorry but I found these to be tasteless.  I also added molasses and an extra egg to help with how dry it was.  I don't think I missed anything.  Reread the recipe to make sure I followed it perfectly.  Maybe alter it to your own liking.  I like how they were sugar free though. "", '           They look beautiful! I used honey instead of maple syrup, and added some slivered almonds just because I could.

I can't make any recipe without messing with it just a bit so I subbed 1/2 cup of golden flax flour and since I'm not really watching calories or sugar I added a touch more maple syrup. Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb.

I followed the baking instructions exactly and the cookies were slightly crispy on the bottom/edges and perfectly flaky (not too dry) in the middle. For the recipe, I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I omitted the cherries, walnuts, maple syrup, vanilla... it was still perfect! I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe! "", '           These were delicious. I didn‚Äôt have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them!

Cherry Cream Cheese Cake,"[""          I didn't have a bundt pan or funnel pan, so I baked it in 2 loaf pans.  This is a dense cake, however I added a scoop of sour cream to keep it from being dry.  I always add sour cream to a baked item when someone's review says it was dry.  I made a cream cheese spread to put on individual slices. "", '          Another delicious keeper for me. I followed the baker who used less flour and more sugar, and I poured some of the cherry juice in too. I used Marischino üçí cherries. I don‚Äôt have an angel food pan, so I used a Bundt pan. I also drizzled the top with some white vanilla icing. Next time I‚Äôd use more pecans and more cherries. All in all, a very flavorful pound cake with good texture that actually tasted better the next day. Crispy on the outside, perfectly smooth on the inside. Also great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing! ', '          I just added a can of thick cream to this mixture and it was perfect‚Ä¶.yummy ', '           You can use 1/4 cup less of the sugar and it is still sweet when you add Cherry frosting over it. Yummy! ', ""          My family loved it! Took the advice from other viewers and added more sugar and less flour. Used dried fig because I didn't have cherries, and just sifted some powdered sugar on top.  Will definitely be making this again. "", '          Could I just give this ten stars??  I made my cake very close to the original (but I did substitute maraschino cherries, as an option that the author suggested & I used 2 small jars of cherries, well-drained & halved).  I used almost the same measurements for sugar & flour as in the original, but in order to add some extra sweetness (as other reviewers had recommended) I chose to add approx. 1 - 1¬Ω cups of white chocolate chips to the cherry/flour mixture, coating all well before I added them to the batter.  You\'d never guess the white chips were in there, yet they add an extra level of yumminess to this already delightful cake.  To take it ""over the top"", I added a drizzle of melted white chocolate (with just a tad of veg. shortening) & thinned with cherry juice.  My chocolate-loving husband gave this an enthusiastic thumbs-up & said it would be even BETTER than cookies at Christmas time. ', '           It looked delicious! Taste was good, however too dry. I always make a recipe the way it is written the first time I try it. I would definitely make some of the adjustments in some of the other reviews in the future. ', '          II made two changes. I divided this into two loaf pans because my husband wanted loaf pans size and I baked it for 50 miinutes. It was moist and delious ', '          I made the adjustments suggested by naples. I made them into cupcakes, baking for 22 mins. They turned out good. I coated the  cups with ground almonds at first but decided that for cupcakes they were too crumby and used paper liners instead. I also cut the cherries into quarters.  They were moist and rich, I would make these again. ']"
Maraschino Cherry Nut Cake,"['          Followed previous advice & used butter Crisco and 11/2 tsp of almond extract in cake batter..baked in 9x13 pan for 30-35 minutes.

Instead of adding food coloring to frosting used very small amount of cherry juice & got a nice soft pink color. ', ""          This cake was so good.  I made sure I sifted the dry ingredients 3 times I also omitted the nuts just because I don't like them. lol I did add a teaspoons of almond extract and I used butter flavored crisco. Cake was moist and light. I used a buttercream "", ""          I didn't care for it but come to find out, my baking powder was outdated which is most likely the reason it didn't rise properly. "", ""          I have been making this  cake for many years but never use pecans, I always use black walnut pieces.  I have a few other changes that I do to make it more moist and lighter however, don't want to bore anyone with this information. "", '          My Maraschino Cherry cake came out very dry & crumbly. ', ""          I followed this recipe to the tee and there are some flaws with it. First, there is no way you can get 2 9in pans worth of cake out of that batter.  If you try, the cook time won't be right.  30 min will make the cake tuff on the outside.  Second, there wasn't enough cherries.  There were some pieces of cake that didn't have ANY cherries in it!!!! I'm going to give it another try(with alterations) before I kick this recipe to the curb! "", ""          The cake was very heavy.  My family of five didn't care for it. I wouldn't make this cake again, "", ""          This cake was just alright.  Not quite as light as I had expected, but my toddlers gobbled it up just the same.  Next time, I'll make it without frosting - it adds way too much sweetness to an already sweet cake. "", '          This recipe is excellent.  It presents beautifully.  I did alter the frosting just a tad.  Instead of the food coloring, I used the cherry juice and some very finely diced marashino cherries.  It gave the frosting a very nice pink tint and the little chunks of cherry gave the frosting a little variety in texture.  I also made this recipe into cupcakes and you do have to be careful not to overbake it.  It can dry out.  All in all, this is as close to my grandmothers recipe that I have found. ']"
Bing Cherry Congealed Salad,"[""          I read through several of the reviews to make modifications - especially Jan's.  My entire family loved it!

I heated the cherry and pineapple juice with the jello added then poured in the coke. I put this mixture in the frig for 30 min then added the fruit, nuts and ""cubed"" cream cheese...stirred and let sit overnite. When ready to serve I set the mold in a sink of warm water for a few minutes...this loosened it from the edges  which allowed me to successfully flip it over for a beautifully ,delicious, molded salad! Received tons of compliments on the taste as well as the beauty. ', '          My grandmother made this for every holiday. I make it for my family now. We love it! ', '          I don\'t know if I will make this again. Everything was fine until I added the (cut up) cream cheese. It was downhill from there. I used electric beaters to ""fluff"" the jello and cream cheese, etc.and it didn\'t happen. I wound up with white speckled jello. Maybe I should have spent more time fluffing the jello up. Maybe the cream cheese should be at room temperature. I think more precise instructions are needed for this recipe. ', '          A favorite with my husband.  Have made many times over the years usually at holidays.  The cream cheese does melt into the hot jello giving it a creamy look and smooth taste... ', '          We have used a recipe like this in my family since the 50s. This is the closest thing I could find.  We always use black cherry jello and we do not blend in the cream cheese .  We cube the cream cheese and add it as well as the other ingredients to the jello mixture when it is syrupy. This keeps the it evenly distributed throughout the salad.  There is an art to the cream cheese. It helps to have it almost frozen but not quite for the cubes to keep their shape. Too frozen and the cream cheese will turn powdery. ', '          This recipe has been in my family for many years. (With only a few alterations.) We just always called it ""Coke Salad"" for lack of the appropriate name. The only difference is we also add a box of Strawberry Jello along with the Cherry. The key to mixing in the cream cheese is to let it soften before adding. Make sure to chip it very fine before adding. (Or add it while the Jello mixture is still somewhat warm.) Don\'t know if there is a difference in Bing Cherries and Dark Cherries but we always used the latter. ']"

Real simple easy winner! ', '          This was wonderful. So easy to make, light and delicious, and  not too sweet.

Cherry Cheesecake Brownies,"[""          I'm going to attempt the recipe, but you should know that the ingredient list calls for 4 eggs, Step 2 uses 4 eggs, and Step 3 calls for 1 egg.

Very disappointed ', ""           A couple notes. 1) There's a lot more of the cheesecake topping than I expected, and it covered more of the top than the promo pictures show. 2) Don't get rid of all the jelly stuff from the cherry pie filling. Use some of it on the brownies. 3) I needed to bake this for about an hour rather than the 35-45 minutes stated in the recipe.

I followed the recipe except used a 15x9 pan and put the filling on top which was gorgeous.  Delicious, rustically pretty and simple. Thank you! ', '          It was ok.  I followed the directions exactly.  The cake texture was similar to a coffee cake.  It was best warm.  It just did not have a lot of flavor.

', '          I was given a basket of fresh figs and came looking for a recipe. I was drawn to the simplicity of this one and also the good reviews. Because I have a tiny kitchenette in which to cook, I used a food processor rather than a standard mixer. I only changed a few things‚ÄîI pur√©ed the figs, I omitted almond extract, used half and half instead of evaporated milk and added a handful of chopped pecans. The batter was delicious and I had high hopes. I used my silicon muffin ‚Äútin‚Äù (1/2 cup per muffin; made 8). I baked for 45 minutes at 350. The muffins came out brown on the outside and doughy in the inside. Not good. I don‚Äôt know exactly what went wrong. ', '          Doubling the recipe worked well for 9"" cake pans. As a commercial grower we store many frozen figs that thaw to be very soft and this is ideal for mashing rather than chopping in this recipe. The filling requires a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to avoid over cooking to proper thickness. Really a splendid cake! ', ""          Made in a 9x13 pan instead of layers. Easy to make. Icing taste great. My figs were a little sweet to start with. Haven't cut the cake yet... Still hot. But I'm sure it's going to be delicious... Smelled yummy baking. ""]"
Fig Preserves,"['          First an important note. Lemosn naturally contain pectin, so they are absolutely necessary to help this gel nicely.  I slice mine paper thin on a mandolin so they cook down to nothing, but leave their bright flavor and geling qualities behind.  I also shop the figs coarsely after draining from their boiling bath so I get more of a jam and not so much whole fruit. Love this with a scrape of vanilla beans and a cinnamon stick or star anise cooked in the jam. Process as usual for jams and itis a huge hit. ', '           Ripping Good Recipe. Super easy to make.

It‚Äôs really easy. Costco carried Fig Jam at one time and we fell in love with it.  And after a run they discontinued it.  I had no  idea it was so easy to make, so when figs are in season I make fig jam ', '          This is delicious and so easy!  I make it exactly as written, but I also add a dash of cinnamon.  Almost as good as my grandmother used to make. ', ""          This is the best recipe I've found for Fig Preserves like my Mimi and MaMaw used to make when I was little!

Fresh Fig Freezer Jam,"['           This was my first time ever making jam or jelly. I read all the reviews thoroughly and decided to take all the advice and pull it together. I definitely used the little food processor or chopper to chop my figs. Also, there was not a packet of liquid CERTO pectin to be found in the store.  ?? I ended up purchasing the powdered sister-product to CERTO - Sure-Jell.  When I mixed in the sugar and the Sure-Jell, I also found that the sugar was not dissolving and mixing in well. I put it on a low heat until the sugar was dissolved and it made a thick jam. I reduce the sugar to approximately 3 to 3 1/2 cups as I definitely didn‚Äôt want it too sweet. At first taste it‚Äôs a bit too much lemon so I‚Äôm hoping that will meld together as it cools and sits for a bit and that the sugar will continue to dissolve well.  It‚Äôs nice and thick, the way jam should be. Also not icky sweet. I am using this on an authentic Italian bruschetta with brie, prosciutto, and arugula, so you want a bit of sweetness, but, not overpowering. I‚Äôm excited to try it I did put it on a cracker with some laughing cow Swiss cheese and it was delicious! ?? ????? ? i‚Äôm super excited to share it with our friends this weekend and hear what they have to say.

At the end I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to it and cooked before I froze it.  My reason for cooking it was that I was trying to make it thicker.

Fig-Ricotta Cake,"[""           This was outstanding!  Rich, moist, perfection.   Took 60 minutes in convection oven at 350 degrees, but just one part of the loaf was not cooked on top in the middle at the highest point just about equal to a tablespoon.   Didn't want to bake it any longer because the ends would be too dry.  Next time I may add 5 more minutes.  Only substitutes I made were I used butter to coat pan versus nonstick cooking spray and when it cooled it was a just a bit tough to remove, but I slid a flat serving utensil on all sides and then lifted it a bit with two utensils.  It was still warm after a half hour of cooling, sooooo good!  The other thing I used was a very good vanilla extract versus almond extract.  Not a big fan of almond flavor as it is in so many Italian cookie recipes.  I added a photo and you will see where it cracked a bit when I took it out of pan because I didn't coat the pan enough.

My kids and husband all loved this.  I agree with other reviewers that the figs are not a big part of the flavor, more of a moist spice cake.  I did not change anything except to leave out the pecans as my family are not fond of nuts in baked goods. ', ""          Very good....very moist.  I added about 2 1/2 cups of figs, and probably could have added a bit more flour, it is moist and very good.  I think its a little sweet, though my figs were very sweet too....taking that in mind, I'd cut the sugar a bit next time...frosting was delish.  Alot like caramel....very yummy overall! ""]"

Kept everything else the same using lemon vs lime, just seemed a better fit. I didn‚Äôt smash the berries first because I figured the immersion would do them in anyway.

Pear-Fig Salad,"['           This was a really nice salad!

Stuffed Leg of Lamb with Balsamic-Fig-Basil Sauce,"[""          It's much better than I thought it'd be.

You won't be disappointed! Make this for company and holidays or just for a nice dinner! Yum! "", ""          Wow. I LOVED the seasoning. I had a 5 pound lamb but the way it was shaped after we unrolled it we decided to cut it in half so it was now only 2.5 pounds.  We cooked one in the instant Pot and one in the oven as directed.  After 25 minutes at 400  in the oven, it was not done at all so I added another 10 minutes and it still was only 100 degrees inside. I cooked it a little more and then decided to take it out because the Intant pot one was done. I doubled all the seasonings and I was very happy with it. I probably didn't need to double the fig sauce. I used some dried figs that were not the figs mentioned. I also found a bottle of the liquor that was the size of an airline bottle for only $3. My kids gave me 8.5 and 9 rating. Husband said 9, so this is really high so I will make this for an occasion and now know to  cook it longer in the oven and lesss time in the instant pot. 25 minutes in the inlant pot would have been fine.  Then glaze in the oven.  I should not have cooked it more in the pot. "", '          I followed the recipe with no substitutions.  AMAZING!!!  I will make it like this from now on!  I cooked it at 350 degrees, checked it at 40 minutes, then another 20 minutes, and then another 10 minutes until it reached 135 degrees.  It was medium well in the center.

I definitely would triple the herb recipe and use the currants and cassis if you can find it.  I also would suggest only the first 25-30 mins at 400 and then lowering your oven temp to 325.  Lastly as other posters have mentioned- TAKE IT OUT OF THE OVEN AT 125-130.  Over cooked lamb has no flavor- let it rest under foil till temp hits 130-135.

I reduced on low for quite a while, maybe 40 "", ""          This is so delicious.  However I didn't have whiskey so I used coconut rum. Great with cheese and very addictive.

Chicken Tenders with Balsamic-Fig Sauce,"['          Made just the sauce to serve over leftover chicken legs and loved it.

Fabulous Fig Scones,"['          These are not scones. The batter was runny, like cake batter. I added an extra 1/2 C oats, but that did not help.

Flavor is fine, but not good enough to want to make these again. ', '          Very, very good. ', '          While it had great flavor, not easy to bake. Dough too wet even after adding extra flour.

MOST popular - definitely will be doing this again - and the grill mess is a small price to pay. ', ""          Made exactly as written. Loved the grilled figs! Loved all of it except ... the Burrata cheese was sort of underwhelming. The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such.  This was good, just not quite perfection for me. "", '          I made this with fresh figs from the garden.

', ""           So lovely.  I'd never had grilled figs before, but holy whoa, they were DELICIOUS.  I didn't even have a grill--I just used a cast iron skillet.  My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it.  The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild.  Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here.  The figs are what make it. ""]"

Three minor changes I made were 1) to use Panache Tiger Strip Fig 2) topped with diced thick sliced bacon instead of prosciutto and 3) I didn't drizzle with honey as the figs were juicy and sweet on their own. Truly delicious! Shared the recipe with friends; will definitely make this again. "", '          The addition of prosciutto sounds wonderful! Being that my paternal grampa was from Greece I highly recommend trying this recipe with Feta instead of goat cheese ;-) They taste awesome grilled too!

Fig and Ricotta Crostini,"['          I had leftover fig and pine nut puree from the Dolce Pesca recipe on this site. Since I happened to have ricotta in the house, this was a perfect way to use it up. I did half with the puree and half with diced figs. On all of them, instead of just putting ""a few ribbons"" of basil, I covered the whole piece of bread with basil, which I think added a lot of flavor. The ones with the puree had more flavor, held the vinegar better, and you could put a lot more topping than with the diced figs. The diced fig ones were noticeably less flavorful, probably because they didn\'t hold as much vinegar. If I make this again, I will do the puree, and add the vinegar to the puree instead of drizzling. ', ""          This is my recipe.

Dolce Pesca (Sweet Peaches),"['           9.1.18  My figs were very ripe, and I was concerned that if I put them in the blender, they‚Äôd turn to mush, so I chopped them as well as the pine nuts.

Needed to find a way to use the fresh figs I had picked at my best friend's house. The combination was wonderful. I didn't use the food processor to grind up the figs and pine nuts, just cause I didn't have one available to me...but I think that it gave it a great textural element. Next time I might toast the nuts prior to combining them with the figs. Thank you Laura for sharing this recipe; this was a great way to end our Italian feast.

Melon Smoothie,"['          This is more of a melon slurry than a smoothie....there\'s nothing smooth about it.  I made this with honey instead of the sugar and slightly less as honey is sweeter.

Jewel's Watermelon Margaritas,"[""          I made this recipe as directed and really enjoyed this cool, refreshing margarita. It's important to use the white tequila (also know as bianca) for the full margarita effect. Gold tequila is smoother and sweeter.  You don't want to add sweetness to the already sweet watermelon.  Additionally I recommend salting the rims of your glasses over sugar.  The salt helps to mellow the sweetness and intensify the watermelon flavor.  Salud! "", '          Da BOM.COM.  To keep it simple my hubby threw 4 cups (for a double recipe) of scraped-out watermelon into a big blender with the syrup (made with erythritol/monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar BTW!), 3 cups of ice, the lime juice and the tequila, and blended.  DELICIOUS and LETHAL!!! ', '           I didn\'t have tequila on hand but I did have rum so I guess I made watermelon ""daquiritas.""

These are bomb! ', '          AMAZING!!! ', '          I find these quite sweet.  I used 1/2 of the simple syrup and will try 1/4 next time.  Served on the rocks.

I blitzed in a food processor and then filtered through a fine colander for more of a ‚Äúwatermelon juice‚Äù consistency. I can see why some people preferred to freeze the fruit and make this more like a slushie - I think that‚Äôs the way to go if you want to keep the pulp.

Watermelon Preserves,"['          Followed to the T....but it candied. Tastes good, tho. ', '          I would suggest throwing the melon and lemon into the blender to liquefy it prior to cooking? Maybe that would have helped. I ended up with two pint jars of thick weird textured product. I added ginger for flavor that did make it taste better, but still weirdest creation I ever made. I would not recommend it. ', '           I used my electric pressure cooker (2 hours on stew (I checked the temp after the first cycle 220 exactly)  to cook the melon and lemon and I used darker natural sugar.   I‚Äôve heard the smell is meh they are right but tastes great!    Next time I‚Äôll add fresh mint as well. ', '          Thinking of trying it with strawberries in it too. ', '          Please forgive, I haven\'t made this yet.  Dad was the expert on tasting watermelon rind preserves: his sister Orene always won the blue ribbon, ergo his opinion was accurate.  Pappy (granddad, a farmer) was famous for the best watermelons in New Albany Mississippi area.  Dad:  Rind has to be thick but tender with no green left on - green parts cook up tasteless and leathery.  Which is extremely hard to find because those traits mean melons don\'t ship well (break easily) and were bred out of fruit in commerce now.   Pappy\'s melons were so intensely flavored you\'d dream of them all winter!  Their rinds trimmed of all green and pink were over 1"" thick and snow white.  Today rinds are thin, tough as nails, greenish.  Farmers tell me to hunt out seeded watermelons, especially heirloom types, which are the sweetest and best tasting anyway.  Farmers have to grow some to pollinate seedless ones.  Also, Dad said lemon spoils the flavor completely.  Orene didn\'t use it.   The flavor should be reminiscent of citron.  Factoid:  a white meat watermelon was grown in the south just for it\'s rind which was candied and used as a substitute for more expensive citron.  Dad passed 1 year ago, age 96. ', ""          Did not set, stayed syrup.  Fruit flavor did not come through, I only taste a sweet/slightly burnt taste.  Maybe try another recipe that doesn't cook the fruit so long, and uses pectin. "", ""          The watermelon tasted like burnt squash after being cooked. (it wasn't actually burned) . The added lemon and sugar did little to flavor it.  I would add a flavored gelatin to boost the flavor and add a little thickness to the gel."", ""          My watermelon stayed in chunks that are pretty solid and don't spread like preserves should. I'd suggest finely dicing or pureeing before cooking. I used two lemons and the whole recipe got quite bitter from the rinds - next time I will only use lemon juice and zest. Otherwise, the jam set pretty well after two hours on a low-ish boil. Other reviews say to boil only 1 hour but mine was still soupy liquid at that point. Overall, I'm glad it worked, but I'm not exactly looking forward to eating all this chunky, bitter preserve. "", '          Is definitely more marmalade like than a preserve. I found previous reviews very helpful. We halved the lemon as suggested and added 2 small velencia oranges with rinds. Leave uncovered during simmer to reduce until desired thickness. Our first batch produced 3 half pints. The fruit did not break down and the final product is very chunky with bits of candied watermelon among the rind pieces. Overall, very good but the recipe is missing many important elements and hints. Thank u previous reviewers, very helpful. ']"

"", ""          I followed the recipe exactly but it wasn't golden brown at 45 minutes so I cooked it an hour.

I cut the cantaloupe pretty small and it still had way too much of that definitive cantaloupe flavor except for a few pieces which were pretty small. The texture of the cantaloupe was really off-putting in combination with the rest of it.

Make sure you taste your melon and adjust your sugar amount...I did not add any extra sugar since my melon was naturally sweet and with the cake mix it was really still too sweet for my liking.  Everyone who tired this raved.  I won't use this recipe again but it has inspired me to create my own without using a box mix so I can control the sweetness.  Another suggestion, make sure your melted butter covers the entire cake mix top or you will have powdery spots.  Maybe use more than 1/2 cup melted butter or spread it out with a spatula after you drizzle it over the top "", ""          This was good, but I did some altering after reading reviews: cut the sugar to 1/3 c. and the cake mix to 1/2 a box [used Jiffy yellow cake, 9 oz].

Cantaloupe Bread with Praline Glaze,"['          The bread was delicious. Like others, I skipped the topping to avoid the calories. I also lightened it up a bit.

I added in 1 cup roasted pecans. I didn't make the topping in this recipe. Tasted great! "", ""          I never would think to use cantaloupe to make a quick bread, but I'm so glad I found this recipe!  It is quite possibly my favorite now. I didn't make the glaze & I made mini loaves, so they could be frozen.  I don't think I would change anything in this recipe, except next time, I'm adding nuts to the batter. SO YUMMY! Had it for breakfast today, toasted with a bit of butter. "", ""          I made the recipe exactly as written, though the praline topping was not appealing so I didn't  add it. It was okay but was more bland tasting than I had expected. I haven't given up on the idea but will likely make some changes the next time I make it. I will probably add nuts to the batter and adjust the sugar (reduce) and spices (change or increase). "", '           The bread turned out wonderful‚Äîthe praline glaze not so much. The directions for the glaze need to state the power setting on microwave. I followed directions exactly and my glaze semi-solidified.

I thought the praline glaze went very well with it (I was worried since another commenter said it did not). Probably won't make again because it really doesn't taste like cantaloupe and honestly it reminded me of banana bread -- so I would rather just make the banana bread :) ""]"
Watermelon Pie,"['          I found it best to cut the watermelon into very small pieces and let them sit over a strainer for 10 minutes or so, helping to drain the juices, therefore no runny pie.', ""          Pie was light and tasty.

Cantaloupe Pie I,"['           This is really labor intensive but worth it. If your cantaloupe isn‚Äôt super ripe, you need to up the sugar.

"", '          Very good.  I would do as another user suggested and use as ripe a cantaloupe as possible.  I made some alterations in order to make it slightly healthier.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and used Splenda in the filling (not the meringue) to cut down the sugar.  I used just slightly over 1/4 cup of Splenda and it was fine.  In addition, I used vanilla instead of butter flavoring and that worked well.  Last, I used a graham cracker crust. ', ""          My Mother in Law was making this 50+ years ago without the pie crust. She couldn't remember the recipe so I found it here. This is the most Awesome Pie Ever. I do leave out the butter extract, but only because I didn't have any. And I don't use a pie crust. This is as close to hers as I have found. Be sure to use a great tasting Ripe cantaloupe. Just Awesome!!! "", ""          My husband just had some dental work done so I just made the filling.  This is a really great pudding!!  I didn't have butter extract so I used vanilla instead.  It turned out fantastic.  This would be a great way to get young children who think they don't like cantaloupe to try it.  I think it would change their mind. "", ""           This recipe was great, I didn't tell my husband what kind of pie it was and had him guess, he thought it was banana! I added a couple dashes of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg, and followed the suggestion to use cornstarch to thicken the filling-(Dissolve the cornstarch in small amount of water then add to filling while on stove)My cantaloupe was very ripe(had dents on the skin) so I suggest you use a little less sugar if your's is also and less sugar on the merengue as well. Let the filling thicken on stove considerably before you place in the baked pie crust. After the pie cooled I refridgerated it then served it chilled. ""]"

Perfect Lemon Curd,"['          Took way longer than 6 minutes but it worked:) ', '          5 STAR for Taste and Ease!

You'll not get scrambled eggs this way either.I used the cream-sugar-and-butter-first method given by Anonymous this time and it worked nicely.Don't forget to sterilise the jam jars and lids first using boiling water if you intend to keep the curd for longer.

I also added oats to the second half of the crumble (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. I also add enough vinegar to make it more wet).  You can replace the 6 cups fruit with any variety you want. I‚Äôve done peach blueberry strawberry. Apple raspberry and blueberry etc. it‚Äôs absolutely divine the way I‚Äôve altered it! I highly recommend trying it my way as brown butter is life! Even if you don‚Äôt want brown butter as the comments suggested double the fruit amount. I‚Äôve made it like 5 times now my way lol. I like my crumble crispy so I turned on the Broiler for a second too. ']"
Mandarin Orange Cake,"['          This is one of the MOST delicious, refreshing cakes ever! My sister made it and I immediately asked her to send me the recipe!

Frankly, I was disappointed.  I took the advise of the review that mentioned  reducing the oil to 3/4 C & adding orange extract. Reducing the oil did not work for me. The cake was too dry! I did add the orange extract & even grated in about 2 TBSP of fresh orange zest. The cake itself was still lacking in flavor. (Also - boxed cake mixes are now reduced to 15+ oz, not 18.  I looked it up & discovered that the extra 3 oz was 1/2 C, so I had a 2nd box & added that.) Maybe it would have been more moist without it?  Hard to say.

Candied Lemon Peel,"['          These look beautiful, so maybe I‚Äôll use them as a decorative garnish, but I don‚Äôt like eating them. They‚Äôre tough and much too sweet.

Great recipe "", '          I make this recipe often. I love that I can make a yummy treat instead of throwing away the peel after juicing the lemons.

I find that if I boil the peel for at least 5 minutes each time I change the water it makes the peel much more tender. ', '          I use these candied peels on top of my lemon pound cake.

I didn't have broth so I used chicken bouillon and a couple of veggie bouillon since I was out of celery and only had 1/2 an onion. I also cooked the chicken and orzo in the broth, and I only added maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice to it because my hubby isn't a fan of lemon, and I figured I can always add more to my bowl.

"", ""          I like the taste I added extra lemon so it was stronger flavour and halved the sugar so it wasn't so sweet. Mine came out dense but I don't mind cakes like that. I have a feeling the reason for some they come out dense and didn't really rise. I think it is to do with the amount of baking powder...recipe says 1 3/4 TSP, however the brand of baking powder I used actually says on the container that it requires 2tsp/1 cup of flour so maybe next time I'll try follow the baking powder directions for the brand I bought I stead of in the recipe and see if that makes a difference.

Lemon Cream Cheese Bars,"['          How is it was to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SO VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

', '           I thought the end result was terrific and the process was so easy! (I just had to try one almost the minute I took them out of the oven!) These bars turned out lemony and not too sweet. In recipes like this that call for the crescents to be rolled out in one piece, I always use the sheets vs. the individual rolls. That makes a big difference! I was so tempted to add an egg to the filling because I have made similar recipes in the past that called for one. I DID NOT add any eggs and the filling was perfect! I didn\'t think the bars turned out ""doughy"" as a few others have mentioned. However, I did not line my pan (I used a glass 9x13) with foil. Perhaps that made a difference in how the crescent dough cooked on the bottom. I\'m certain I will make this recipe again! ', ""           I did make a few changes to suit my baking tastes. Instead of using the entire roll of dough, I only placed enough to cover the bottom. Then buttered it lightly as I pressed it into place, with a small amount of sugar  sprinkled on top. Prick the dough so it doesn't puff up in the oven. Bake just until it starts to lightly brown, then cool completely. I increased my sugar to one and one quarter cup to balance out the quarter cup of lemon juice. I added the one egg as suggested by another reviewer. I also added one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and grated in a small amount of nutmeg. Finished off with an eighth of a teaspoon of lemon extract. I wanted the lemon flavor to be pronounced! Again with the second roll of dough, used only enough to cover the top. I used kitchen shears to cut up pieces of dough to fill in any open spots. The end result was great, with a crispy top and bottom and no sogginess from too much dough. I'll save the extra crescent dough for rolls, lol. "", '          This was so easy to make and delicious.  I took it to a gathering where there were several desserts, and this was gone in no time! ', ""          This was a very good dessert. Took other reviewers' advice and baked the bottom layer first, let cool, then proceeded as directed in the original recipe, no soggy crust and overall good lemony taste, no bitterness. Thank you for a good recipe! "", '          I loved these.  I‚Äôm not a fan of lemon so I swirled some eras berry jam thru the cream cheese mixture.  I didn‚Äôt have a problem with the bottom crust but I‚Äôm making them tomorrow for a family dinner so I‚Äôll try pre cooking the bottom crust this time just to see if I like them better.  This time I‚Äôm going to use a blueberry compote. ', '           Yes I used a very generic brand of crescent rolls that did not stretch so I used more than called for on the bottom layer, baked that layer immediately to a nice golden brown then took it out to cool while I made the filling, so another thick layer of generic brand crescent rolls covered the top for the crust, so I used 4 tablespoons of butter to brush on top , then mixed the zest, white sugar and a touch of nutmeg together to sprinkle on top of the raw buttered crescent rolls , spots left a bit open I sprinkled a light amount of sugar on the bare open areas for consistency. Then I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes, took it out to set, then my grandson wanted a taste after 20 minutes and so did I , it was very delicious, very unusual in an unexpected good flavor. I never knew these generic brand crescent rolls would ever transform into a lovely dessert bar such as this.

Lemon-Orange Orange Roughy,"['           I used cod and could not even taste the freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, only lemon pepper seasoning.

Anyhow, I made just a simple lemon glaze icing and today after cooling the batter overnight made a huge difference.

Lemon Garlic Chicken,"['          It was quite good.   I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  When I took the chicken out, I added 2 Tbs of flour to the leftover butter in the pan.

If I had a juicer for the cucumber it would‚Äôve helped. The final product was delicious and refreshing. Very tart and very sweet though, so I‚Äôd suggest adding 1/4-1/2 cup of water at the end to dilute the flavor. ', '          I like the flavor of the cucumber with the lemon, but I felt there was too much lemon.  It almost immediately gave me heartburn from the acid.  I did use bottled lemon juice (1-1/2 cups, per recommendation of another user.)  Next time, I will reduce that to 1 cup and see if it is better.  I had to add more sugar this time to help with the sourness of the lemon, but I may not have to when I reduce the amount of lemon juice.  I had a large overgrown cucumber from the garden to use up.  I got about 3/4 cup juice from it, and put it all in.  Then I added the lemon juice and simple syrup - no need to cool down for a long time.  I put this all in a 2-qt pitcher, added about 1qt ice cubes and filled the rest with cold water, then stirred.  The ice melts and cools down the drink very fast, and the water to flavors ratio was good.  I have some mint and basil in the garden.  I am going to try placing some leaves in individual glasses of this to see how it tastes. ']"

I followed the recipe exactly and used both blackberries and raspberries for mine. There were many in my family who had had cobbler before and they said it was delish. It was mushy, but not in a bad way. It was not super sweet, but not NOT sweet: it was just right with the sugar. My crust got a little too crispy in some areas, but otherwise it was a very satisfying desert.It was also super easy to make. I thought cobblers would be more complicated, like a pie, and was relieved to find I was wrong.This fruit cobbler is a delicious and easy to make dessert that I highly recommend for any bakers, beginner or otherwise.Edit: I have made this with gluten free all purpose flour and oat milk for a fairy and gluten free desert. This cobbler never dissapoints!! ']"

Southern Peach Cobbler,"['           Very  simple recipe. I added an 1/8th of a teaspoon of Baking Powder, a little more sugar and a dash of corn starch. It was very delicious!! ', ""          A few things I forgot in my review. It took 60 mins to get the golden I wanted, at 350. I might bump that up a bit. Also I think you can reduce the sugar to 2/3- 3/4 of a cup. It was super sweet. I saw peeps complaining about it being mushy. I think that's from not letting your casserole and butter get to temp. Just melting the butter isn't enough, you need it bubbling. That way the batter starts to cook and rise as soon as you put it in the casserole. Using glass is also the best way to go.I'm now making another cobbler from this recipe, with mixed frozen berries and fresh blueberries with the sweetening reduced and sugar replaced with Splenda.   üëç "", '          My husband loved it.

I just couldn't bring myself to use completely raw eggs. I am so glad I cut the sugar. It was perfect at 2 cups. The sugar is the only reason I took a star off. It would have been way to sweet with the sugarstated. My husband told me it was the best ice cream I've made. Absolutely delish. Just beware it makes a double batch for most ice cream makers.

I think I used about 7 fresh peaches (one Aldi\'s 32 oz bag full) sliced thinly and sauteed them in a stick of butter until tender ( a good 20 mins)- added lemon juice and lots of brown sugar and cinnamon sugar to taste - a pinch of salt too ( half teaspoon as the butter is salty too). Since my peaches were pre-cooked -I baked for 30 mins at 400 F .  I checked biscuit with a knife and turned it off while we did an errand and ate dinner. It was perfect an hour later.

Marie's Peach Dump Cake,"[""          The first time I made it it was cake like and delicious and there preaches stayed intact.  The second time it was mushy. I really don't know what I did wrong the second time. But both tasted absolutely delicious! "", '          This came out pretty good. I tried to make a smaller batch than the recipe but I think my math was off. I could have used more peaches and a little more cake mix. Overall I liked it. Added a little cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste wide both were good adds. It was more peach crumble than peach pie but I prefer that. I would recommend this recipe ', ""          I've never had much luck with dump cakes because the cake mix stays dry, but I needed something quick to take. I only wanted a small pan so I used an 8x8 and one can of peaches in fruit juice. Half a boxed cake mix is 1-2/3 cup so that on top of peaches. Then I GRATE my cold butter over all. Once the butter melts in the oven I lightly stir it around with a fork so the cake mix is evenly dampened. After it starts to bubble around the edges I break the top up with a fork (don't stir) so the juice bubbles all over and creates a yummy topping. You don't have to worry about the cake falling because it stays more like a crust so open your oven as often as you need to to prevent those powdery places! Tasted great! I didn't change the recipe, just the process a little. "", ""          It was easy, but very thin so it didn't make as many servings. It is like a Cobbler."", '          Was very easy, next time I going to try it with different fruit.  Used the french vanilla cake mix.  Was very sweet... ', ""          I made this recipe with the suggested tweaks of using only half of the cake mix and melting the butter for better distribution.   It was SO sweet.  If you like really sweet things, you will probably like this recipe, but it was way too much for me.  One thought I had, though, is that it might be good as a topping on plain oatmeal.  I don't plan on making it again. "", '          This is not a cake. This is more of a ‚Äúcrisp‚Äù or ‚Äústreusel‚Äù', '          Tastes good but it came out mostly powdery on top.

Peachy Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce,"['           Very yummy üòä ', ""           This recipe is a family favorite! Honestly, better than you can find at any restaurant! Normally, I tweak recipes to my own liking but this one is perfect as written! Ok, one small tweak I made was to double the rum in the sauce but that's just because I like a heavier rum flavor! "", '           Heaven! I‚Äôm the kind of person who rarely makes a recipe as written. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to infuse and enhance for more flavor and I typically do a thorough read of the reviews for inspiration on alterations. Number one, I used a whole loaf of crusty, 3 day old French bread. It ended up being a little over ten cups. I started with less than that, but it needed all of it to fully absorb the amount of liquid I ended up with since I used 3 fresh, very juicy peaches. Two of them were a little less soft and ripe, so I baked them for 15 min with a little brown sugar, butter, and a mixture of honey, maple syrup, and a dash of rum extract drizzled over. Instead of 1 1/4 cups of just water, I used the liquid from a can of fruit cocktail (just cuz it was what we had on hand) mixed with the liquid leftover from the baked peaches, and water for the remaining amount. I added one extra egg. I ended up with a perfect ratio of bread to custard and it perfectly filled a 9x13 pan. I ended up letting it sit and soak more in the fridge for about an hour while I prepared the rest of dinner. Baking for 1 hour at 325 was just right. Instead of rum in the sauce, I used half rum extract and half vanilla extract and the rummy flavor was just right for me. Served it with vanilla ice cream. One of the best desserts I‚Äôve made, maybe ever. Dad said he was going to the store to buy more ingredients for me to make it again lol. ', '          AWESOME RECIPE! DEFENTLY I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.    THE CARMEL SAUCE IS  GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT ON ICE CREAM  OR WITH SLICED APPLES.  YUMMY! ', '          This turned out incredible. The family loved it. I will make this again. For the caramel sauce i substituted 2 tbs of Crown Royal Peach instead of the rum. ', '          I just finished the recipe the flavoring is delicious, however I added 1 additional cup of  water because the bread absorbed the egg batter leaving it dry. Otherwise my early thinking made it all worth it. ', '          So good!  We used 2t vanilla instead of rum (as stated in notes) and poured it over the top in the 9x13, turns out delicious every time. ', ""          This recipe was very good with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviews, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The bread pudding itself was a decent base but definitely needed more peaches (I used 1 quart of home-canned but will use 2 next time) and at least 1 additional egg (I used 4, but will use 5 next time).  I also reserved the juice the peaches were in and used that instead of water.  I used 1 package of hot dog buns which turned out great as it used them up and I didn't want to go out and buy French bread."", ""          Inadvertently overcooked it, but still good.  I added an extra egg and  1 cup bread per other suggestions.  Next time may use canned or frozen peaches as I don't enjoy peeling fresh peaches! ""]"

', ""          An easy summer dessert to have prepped and in the fridge, awaiting a brief stint in the oven or bbq after the main meal is cooked. As per other reviewers, I used fresh (Ontario) peaches, regular brown sugar, and doubled the vanilla.  I'm guessing the better the peaches (and ripeness), the better the flavour.  We did serve this in individual heatproof greased crocks (for quicker baking and serving), with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream and a side of cinnamon walnut coffee cake.  I also made two other individual servings using artificial sweetener (used different small crocks to differentiate);  I should have dissolved in melted butter first as the powder didn't dissolve during the baking process, although the two guests that had those enjoyed them after stirring it up a bit.

Fresh Peach Pie I,"['          My first try at fruit pie.  I cheated and used Pillsbury ready-to-bake crust.  Baked as directed and set aside to cool.

I did start layering with sauce first, then peaches, alternately layering til full.  (Thanks to those that gave user comments for me to consider.)  Looked beautiful, next time no fork, see photo.

Pear Pie III,"['          hey this was a great recipe 5 stars for it ', '           This was delicious and beautiful.  Everyone really liked it.  I used three pears and it was perfect.

It was a nice alternative to apple pie at thanksgiving. ', ""           I haven't actually cut the pie yet, but I did pick a few pieces of fruit off of the top. Delicious. A few changes were made because of the ingredients that were already in the house. I used about 6 small sand pears and 2 small golden delicious apples. Because I had so much fruit (I had to use it all as the apples were becoming wrinkled in the fruit bowl) I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Used all spice instead of cardamom. 1/8 teaspoon of ginger and almond essence. I also did not use all of the liquid.  As you can see from the picture, I didn't arrange the fruit either.   The pears stay crunchy. Crust nice. I prefer a sweet crust.  Husband loved it "", '          Fantastic recipe as is, but also super flexible. Have used whatever fruit or jam I have on hand with equally delicious results. Makes quite and impression when brought to dinner parties.

She does drain out the orange juice - otherwise you will have an apple tart mess. She pain stakingly arranges the fruit in a beautiful design, and the presentation is gorgeous. She has made it in small pans for individual servings and in a large pan. It's simply delicious. "", ""          I had trouble with the crust.  I used gf flour but even so, the dough was just crumbly and couldn't be rolled out.  I ended up pressing it into the pans. "", ""          This is a very nice adaptable method!

Sooo I took the next review and turned it up to high. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger to the cream cheese mixture PLUS 1 1/2 teaspoons of finely diced candied ginger (Penzey\'s) to the cream cheese and sugar mixture. Wow! This is fabulous.

Maple-Pear Tarte Tatin,"[""          This was a wonderful recipe! I started it and then realized I was out of puff pastry, so I used phyllo instead- a little butter between the sheets and it was golden. Aside from that the only thing I think I'd do again is add a pinch of salt to the sauce. It was soooo good! Yum! "", '          I used phyllo dough on the bottom as opposed to the puff pastry, gave it more of a baklava texture. ', '           This came out really good.  The syrup is really was sweet with a nice maple flavor. Another reviewer includes bourbon which would go great with this flavor profile.  The puff pastry was soft but not mushy. My husband was able to pick it up and eat it like a slice of pizza. Overall, its a was great recipe that is easy to make. ', '           I followed the recipe , I drained most of the juice out of the skillet before baking.  I took the pastry out and put on a plate right side up and put the remaining juice around the plate.  I kept it right side up so the pastry would not get soggy.  Thanks for the great recipe! ', '          My husband took this out of the oven, flipped it, and started to eat it. He declares it delicious. ', '          I made it just as written and it was excellent!  I pears were extra firm, which I was worried about but it turned out great.  Will for sure make again. ', ""          I would definitely make this again.

Puff pastry tends to always be a little chewy (I use it in other recipes such as chicken pot pie), so maybe next time I might try another option, like phyllo. ']"
Bartlett Pear Pie,"[""          What a mess!! This is a soupy mess. I cooked it for 45 minutes and it never set. Don't make it!! "", '          Watery mess.  Good flavor . ', '          WET DISASTER. Baked for 50 minutes and it is still terrible. House smells great though. ', '           I\'ve never made a fresh fruit pie before so I was glad to find a good base recipe to experiment with.  (Tip: If you\'re working with fresh pears, the easiest way that I\'ve found to peel them is to boil them for about 20-30 seconds one at a time and have a bowl of cold water on hand.  After you boil one, just plop it in the bowl and just lightly rub on the skin under water with your thumb...peels right off and the skins just sink to the bottom.)  After I peeled and cut them I put them in a gallon plastic bag and poured about a shot each of brandy and spiced rum.  I also put all of the spices in the bag that the recipe called for (with a little extra cinnamon bc I like the flavor).  I let it marinate in the fridge for about 6ish hours and then prepared the filling.  I felt the pie needed a ""topping"" so on half of the pie I sprinkled some Coach\'s Oats on the top.     Results:  Flavor was excellent!  I liked the oat side better than the non-oat side but both were good.  I didn\'t dry off the pears or try to dehydrate them a little before adding the liquor and such so it turned out a bit more liquidy than I\'d like so I think next time I\'m going wipe them down a bit with some paper towels before adding the liquids...and maybe bake it about 5ish minutes longer. ', '          This was easy and fast and taste great. I baked it for 40 min. Will make again! ', '          I made it exactly to the directions.  It was runny and had too much allspice.  Next time I will try adding tapioca pudding mix and baking a little longer.  I will add more cinnamon and less allspice.  I was sad this time though since I made three for my work Christmas party.  Everyone was excited to try it and it was just mediocre. ', '          As usual, I lacked some of the ingredients. Only had about 2/3 of the white sugar, so substituted Splenda brown sugar for the rest of the white as well as the brown sugar. Found a recipe for allspice- 1/3 each of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Used salted butter- no unsalted. Greased the bottom of a 9x9 inch pan, because I had no crust. ', '           I make this pie with coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free. ']"
French Pear Pie,"[""           This recipe is so easy and so tasty! I used canned pears and no lemon (didn't have any).

Only complaint is that it was too juicy. Next time I'll add corn starch to the fruit mixture. "", ""          This was really good.  My pears seemed a bit juicy, so I added just a little bit of flour to the pears before putting the crumb topping on.  I also added a bit of ginger to the crumb topping.  The only complaint I have is that it was still very wet after baking causing a bit of sogginess, but the flavor was delightful. I love that it wasn't a pear pie trying to be an apple pie. ""]"

French Puff Pastry Tart with Pears and Chocolate,[]
Frangipane Pear Tart,"['          Show stopper!Although I did take liberties.

OMG . . . really awesome! I learned a few things while making this. 4 pears is too many for a 9"" tart. I ended up poaching 3, and only ended up using about 2-1/2 of them (they were delicious, so I just ate the leftovers). There is too much of the frangipane filling as well. I used all of it, and when I placed the pears on top, the pears sunk into the filling (hence not the beautiful presentation that I was hoping for) and while it was baking, the filling went over the edges and onto the baking sheet (good call on having a baking sheet under the tart pan)! I also didn\'t use blanched almonds. I just ground them up in my food processor, which I\'d do again.  The flavor is wonderful though, so I\'d definitely make this one again. Oh, and that poaching liquid - I strained that and have been  using it to sweeten a cup of tea. It\'s just lovely! ']"

It didn‚Äôt taste overwhelmingly like pears, but we both thought:  what do pears actually taste like in any recipe?  Not a strong taste.  We had tons of pears off of our own trees.  I finely chopped then instead of grating.  It was moist and good.  Look forward to seeing how it toasts in the morning.

Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup,"['          I made this exactly as instructed. I make several butternut squash soups, and never add milk or cream to keep the calories down. But I added half and half this time, and it makes a huge difference. It is very creamy and very filling.

Pear Butter,"[""          One spoonful & all of my kids (5 adults) each wanted some!  Normally I like the shorter reviews but I have some information about how mine came out.

I used my immersion blender to blend the butter & although I left the lid off for a couple of hours, it never thickened up.  So I added 2 packages of Knox Unflavored Gelatin & turned out the perfect consistency when cooled.The second batch I did not add the water at the bottom because of the prior results & accidently forgot the orange juice.  I did add the zest near the end but didn't want to add the juice seeing how it all ready had a lot of liquid.  Again, added the unflavored gelatin to thicken it up.  The taste is slightly different but still amazing!  I will make it again next year but I may try using pectin to see the results. "", '          I love the flavor of this recipe and will use it again. I made it to the directions and the only change I will make is next time I will peel and core my pears, I did not care for the mashing and mess with hot fruit.

I used my CrockPot as others had suggested and it worked...BUT when I started to clean the crock, I discovered it had a couple of hairline fractures.  I contacted the company, CrockPot, and was told the pot must be 2/3 to 3/4 full or the heat can buildup and result in cracks in the crock or the lid.  I did take the lid off for the last 2 or 3 hours to allow the moisture to evaporate.  So, just a word of warning to those using a slow cooker.

The only issue I have was once it cooled the orange flavor was obsolete and the cinnamon flavor was powerful. I even decreased my cinnamon and added an extra orange with orange extract so I‚Äôm not sure what happened. I usually make another recipe but this one sounded so good. It is better as far as sweetness. It was a great addition to my sliced turkey sandwich that I had for lunch and it‚Äôs great on oatmeal!  We‚Äôve also used it as jam on our toast and pancakes!

Apple-Cranberry Salad,"['          I thought this salad to be delicious!

', '           We enjoyed this in spite of the fact that the pears I used did not have a ton of flavor.  This would make a really nice party appetizer, cut into small wedges.  From a presentation point of view, the pear slices looked a little dry when this came out of the oven.  Next time I think I\'ll try heating a little bit of apple jelly and brushing it on the fruit before it goes into the oven.  For whatever reason, the crust ended up tough/too chewy...I used a Boboli thin pizza crust.  In the future, I think I\'ll use my own homemade pizza crust.

I had 1/2 bunch of swiss chard to use up so I chopped it finely and threw that in while cooking the chicken. When chicken was browned on both sides, I added in the leftover sauce that I didn't use on the pizza. I had two ripe pears to use up so I peeled those, chopped and threw them in too. Cooked until chicken was almost falling apart, maybe 40 mins. Served it over jasmine rice. YUM! "", '          best. pizza. ever. made. it was amazing! and so easy.

Fruit Leather,"[""          I made some strawberry syrup with some fresh strawberries and didn't want to just throw out the left over strawberry mash and then I saw this recipe.

', '          This is a good recipe, but I use a food mill, and have apple puree, which is great.

This weekend we made strawberry/blackberry mix together, And My kids along with my husband were eating them before I could get them rolled! ', ""          I did this with VERY ripe pears so I used about half the sugar.  I did use my vitamix and it does make it easier.  It's not really necessary to peel the fruit, but you do need to remove the seeds, especially apple seeds as they are pretty toxic.  My 19 month old grandson loved it.  His Mommy liked it too!  At first I was unhappy because I didn't get it super evenly spread, but the edges got a little cripsy while the middle was chewy.  It was two foods in one, fruit leather and fruit chips!  Thanks for the recipe!!! "", ""          I tried this recipe with strawberries and raspberries and it was not good.

It didn't seem to soak in as much as I thought it should.. definitely a keeper but I will use a different glaze recipe next time that doesn't make so much. "", ""          I didn't find this cake troublesome at all - it easily accomplished by a novice cook.   That being said, I wasn't impressed.  I thought with all the positive reviews I would love it, but it's not that spicy and it's WAY too sweet.  It has a very bland flavor profile.  Will not be making it again.  Many other great spice cake recipes out there that are so much better.  A good one to try is  America's Test Kitchen's recipe for Gingerbread Layer Cake (you can make it in a bundt pan easily) - it's WONDERFUL.  Much more complex and flavorful.  Won't help you use up that bag of prunes, but great nonetheless! "", ""          Very similar to my Mom's recipe, which she got from an Italian lady whom my family was great friends with.  In fact I often called her my second Momma growing up.  I make this only once a year so needed a reminder of the spice amounts,  when I couldn't find Mom's recipe this year I came here.

Baby Food: Plum,"['           I have made all of my own baby food for all of our children, this is a great tutorial for new moms wanting to make their own healthy homemade baby food. If the plum mixture is to thin you can thicken it up with some cereal or thin it out with formula, breast milk or the cooking water  (the cooking water has some vitamins & nutrients which get leached out during steaming). As baby gets older  I add in some spices such as; cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, etc. ']"
Easy Plum Cake,"['          When I put the batter in the pan, it was insufficient to cover the bottom of the pan, so I quickly made another recipe of batter to add on top. It took almost twice as long to bake, but was wonderful! 10/10!! Love it! ']"
Tangy Plum Liqueur,"['           Extremely great!!!! I made sure to get the correct vodka amount and follow the recipe perfectly except that I was worried that the fermentation container would bust on its side so I sat it up to relieve pressure. Tastes amazing and I made 4 liters of plum liquor. Can‚Äôt taste the vodka at all but definitely get a nice smooth vanilla-y taste !!! ', '          I made this recipe following the instructions exactly. I also made another batch with less sugar. I did not use wax to seal the jars--I used regular mason jar lids, and I stored the jars in a cool dark place, shaking every week or so to combine ingredients. The results were very good. We enjoyed the lower sugar batch more than the full sugar one. The low sugar liqueur was plummier. I think the syrupy batch would make a good topping for dessert. ', ""          Mine came out on the sweet side.  I'm not sure if this is due to the type of plums I used or the amount of sugar in this recipe.  Guess I'll have to try again next year ;).

It is a major sugar overload.  Almost a cup in the dough, another cup in the filling with the already-sweet plums, and another quarter cup for the crumb topping. It was so insanely sweet I actually had to manually remove the filling and rinse it out to make the pie actually edible. Once I did that I suppose it was okay. I recommend halfing the overall sugar that is called for here, if not also omitting the crumb topping. "", '          Really disappointed. There was so much liquid in the pie after baking that it just fell apart when trying to serve. Maybe I used the wrong plums?! Recipe didn‚Äôt specify and the store only had one kind.

Used an 8 in x 6 in ceramic cake pan instead of a tube pan.  Added 1 Tbsp vanilla instead of lemon zest.  Also, sprinkled sugar on the bottom of the cake pan and on top of the cake before baking.  Turned out perfectly. ', '          As is this tart is tasty at 3 1/2 stars, but the crust needed something.  After making it a second time with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and cardamom and 1 teaspoon vanilla, the flavor was so much better.  The cardamom with the plum was prefect.  I also sliced the plums much thinner and laid them in a rosette around the top. ']"
Roasted Pork Tenderloin with Fresh Plum Sauce,"['          its the best i loved it ', '          My cupboards were shy on shallots and balsamic vinegar, so I substituted garlic an white.

Turned out great--great mix of tart and sweet, and great with coffee or milk. "", '           I, too, found that the topping just sat on top and after 35 minutes baking it was still white flour sitting on top.  I poured some melted butter on it and baked another 30 minutes.

Plum Pudding Sauce,"['           4.9.20  Followed the recipe, but I did cut back the sugar because we‚Äôre just not into too sweet these days (that‚Äôs personal taste).  The recipe doesn‚Äôt tell you this, but after you add the flour and vanilla, you need to cook for about another 10 minutes or so low temp to thicken this into a sauce, otherwise you‚Äôll have something that is the consistency of milk. I ended up adding more flour to thicken it a bit.  Also, take a few spoonfuls of the sauce and put it in a small bowl before you add the flour/vanilla.  Add the flour/vanilla, stir it well, and then add back to the sauce,  Otherwise if you add the flour directly to the hot milk-sugar-egg mixture without tempering it, you‚Äôll end up with lumpy sauce.  The flavor is excellent, and I can see this on so many desserts, particularly bread pudding.  We enjoyed a drizzle of it on a slice of apple pie. ', '          The recipe was easy to make.  I was hesitant at first but by the time I started stirring and tasting, even Gordon Ramsey would have complemented me.  Outstanding over my Rum Cake. ', '          Yum, this was perfect!

Cooked in my 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I am making four more this weekend to share with family.  It was a HUGE hit. ', '           I liked it 100% the coffee cake was excellent.

It turned out beautifully.  It was still warm when I cut the first piece and it was soft, almost pudding-like but oh, so tasty.  I covered it and put it in the fridge and hope it will firm up a little.  Even if not, it is still very good.  Next time I will use regular flour which will make it firmer I'm sure.

I greased the pan with Crisco and mixed the butter and brown sugar in a separate bowl and microwaved a tad before spreading it in, so as not to disturb the Crisco coverage.  I used two outer circles of plums, and the middle blueberry.  I also made 5 single lines of blueberries coming out from the center like spokes on a wheel.

Pork with Plum Sauce,"['          Great recipe,  I substituted plum jam (2-3 tablespoons) instead of plums, and only 1 teaspoon of brown sugar.

I think fresh ginger would be a good addition instead of the ground ginger. "", '          I did not like it - the soy sauce was too overpowering.  I made this for 1 person and cooked the sauce only about 10 minutes.  The plums were soft by that point and the sauce was thickened. ', ""          Love to use fruit to flavor meat. Nice to make rather than a sugary jarful.  Used chicken broth, sprayed with Brach's Amino Acids,  no vinegar or brown sugar, 2 whole cloves vs. ground.

Fresh Fruit Frangipane Tart,"['          I was disappointed. It sounded fantastic, and I was eager to try this recipe. It looked beautiful. The puff pastry was spectacular.

Plum Dumplings,"['          I did not intend to make any changes to this recipe, but my dough was crumbly so I added more mashed potato.

Some plums got a double dose of the sugar&spice mixture; by the time they were ready to get wrapped, they'd juiced up so some of the mixture had run out and I topped it up again (oh, the horror!).   And that is the only thing I changed. The pastry worked out and despite some misgivings at when I first started mixing the ingredients together, the texture actually turned out perfectly.

Second batch, cooking time after pit removal = 45 minutes. Jam turned out perfect.', ""          So far sounds perfect- I hate pitting fruit to can.  I do a lemon jam this way, so I'm pretty sure it'll work.  I did put in 2 cinnamon sticks, about a teaspoon of ground cardamom, and a Tablespoon of lemon juice.  Update:  I learned a cool method of pitting and peeling, but jam is too tart, and didn't firm up, stayed a syrup.  Fruit also had a burnt flavor because it cooked so long.  Will be a perfect cobbler filling. "", '          Only had 2.14 lbs so the cardamom was dropped to 7 pods and the sugar to 2 cups. Cooked for about an hour  and made 4 half-pints. Never again will I waste my time or ingredients by fishing for plum seeds in the jam. Cut the plums in half before you begin, remove the seeds, and save yourself a lot of mess, time, and most importantly, fruit. The finished jam is tart and delicious. Will make it any time I can get my hands on Damsons. ']"
Fresh Fruit Cobbler,"['          I‚Äôve been searching for a cobbler recipe for a while and finally found it! ', '           Great starter recipe! Made it with the following revisions: used 10 peaches, 1 c raspberries, 3 c blueberries and 2c blackberries - all fresh. Added 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 flour plus 2 tsp apple pie spice to fruit and mixed well. Tripled the batter recipe and split the fruit and batter between 2 9x9‚Äù pans.

It reminded me of my mother's cobbler, but I wanted some fruit syrup to develop as it cooked.  I think lots of folks are judging against what their mom or grandma made, so a cobbler has a different definition for everyone.  For me, I think the cobbler needs more fruit, at least another 1 1/2 cups.  I believe the extra fruit and about 1/4 cup of sugar, moved from the crust to the fruit, will help some syrup to develop.  At any rate, I'm glad I found this recipe, and I know my family will be quite happy.  In fact, I'll bet the cobbler will be gone, by bedtime!  Thanks for the idea!

Prune Cake,"[""           This cake is tremendously delicious. My family and I love it, and I have made it several times.

I use Sucanat (dehydrated sugar cane) which gives big molasses flavor with less sugar. Also, I added a dash of sea salt, it helps bind the flavors (just a DASH).

After reading the reviews, and respecting mis7up, as a fellow buzzer, I took her advice and added a little extra sugar.  I added an additional 1/4 cup, making my total 3/4 cup.  Butter (all I use) was used in place of margarine.  I decided to bake in 5 mini (6x3 1/2) loaf pans rather than a 13x9 pan. They rose beautifully and were done at the 35 minute mark.  I served this bread with 'Christmas Morning Egg Casserole' from AR.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoys them as bread, but our favorite way to eat them is toasted.

Two important points though: the amount of dough turns out to be enough for a cake amost double the size. As it is in the recipe it would overflow the tray and shed plums to the sides. Also: is it absolutely vital that an amount of milk/water is more precisely specified for the kneading phase. For a non-expert ""as needed"" doesn\'t make any sense, and the level of moisture achieved is critical for a good drozdz√≥wka, because if too dry it\'s miserable.', '          I\'ve been looking for years for a recipe for a cake made with yeast, longing to replicate one we used to get all the time from the bakery in the Polish neighborhood where my father lived. I was so excited when I found this one, but alas, this came out more like a heavy bread than a cake. I think I\'ll try it again someday, using half the flour and double the milk. Also, the instructions say to ""knead in as much air as possible,"" but as a cooking technique, kneading is about pushing air out, not incorporating it in. So I\'m not sure what the author means by that. I think if this were more of a batter it might be a good recipe.

Easy to make and delicious for breakfast or tea time. I had a hard time fitting all the fruit on top. In fact, in the end I had to leave out one peach and one plum. I guess the final amount will depend on the size of your fruit. ']"
Prune Filling,"['          This is a very good prune filling. I did stew dried prunes in apple juice because that‚Äôs what I had. I made fruit filled cookie bars with it and my grandkids loved it, they didn‚Äôt know it was prunes lol! ', ""           I made a half batch of this filling, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also used dried prunes that I stewed in orange juice with some orange zest (so I ended up using orange juice instead of the lime juice called for in the recipe). This filling is slightly spicy, sweet, citrus-y, and definitely prune flavored (which I love!). I'm going to use it to fill paczki's. Thank you for the recipe!

Plum Chipotle Sauce,"['           The neighbors had Italian prune plums and I pitted and pur√©ed them. It‚Äôs delicious, I got four pints out of eight cups of plums.

This is why I gave it 4 stars. So I added anothrr jalapeno and added extra vinegar. I cooked it for at least twice as long because it was too liquidy.  it was still liquidy but it jelled to jam thickness as it sat. I made it again with 1/2 cup less sugar and an extra 1/2 jalapeno and cooking it longer.   ', '          This is ridiculously good.  I did not use the liquid smoke.  I did use the chipotle in adoba.

I can imagine the task of pressing each of those raw through a colander to get juice. I also wanted to make as many jars as possible to can for Christmas gifts. I had to do some math for the conversions that I hope will be helpful to someone else. There are 6 to 8 regular size plums in 1 pound. For my Italian plums, there are 11 to 12. That means 44 plums to 1 quart. For this recipe, that would be 220 small plums. I simply cut them in half to remove the pit and then put them in my food processor. I buzzed 10 at a time and got them as smooth as possible. I repeated this until I had used all the plums and in total, I got 25 cups of. Fruit. You would get 33 cups if you had the 5 quarts the recipe calls for. I increased the vinegar and added a quarter cup of pectin just to make sure that this would can and keep well. I also read reviews about it being a too sweet and knew the vinegar would both help at preserve it and tone down the sweetness. I processed half pints in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and got 32 jars! Already served it with roast pork and then tacos and everyone loved it. I will share pictures and the full ingredients are used: 25 cups pur√©ed plums. 1/4 cup pectin. 4 cups apple cider vinegar. 6 cups sugar. 6 cloves garlic. 2 1/2 Tbs salt. 1 large onion. 1 jalape√±o. 1/4 cup chipotle peppers in adobo. Cooked everything down for an hour and a half at a simmer before canning. ', '          Absolutely love this bbq sauce.  This is my second year making it.  It is a bit difficult to get any juice out of the plums just by squeezing them by hand.  I ended up using a juicer, and my food processor.  I like it a bit chunkier than the recipe is.  And I do recommend using Penzeys chipotle seasoning.  I used about 1/2 of the amount, and it was perfect.  Oh, and skipped the jalepeno as well.  I didnt think it needed it. ', '          First off -- I am not a fan of plums, but this is SOOO good. ', '          Ths is the second year I have made this; it became a staple for us over the winter.

I'd never whipped evaporated milk before and I expected it to thicken more like cream, but it doesn't. It just gets a bit bubbly. But I mixed it in anyway and put it in the fridge and it did thicken!

This cake (kuchen) was absolutely delicious. I used plums off of my tree (I had a huge bumper crop) and I was so glad it turned out as good as it did. I thought it would be too sweet but the plums gave it a delicious tanginess. I0t would be good with ice cream, a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I will definitely be making this again0 ', '          I think this has good potential, but my family did not prefer it. I think the biggest complaint was the skins.  Next time I try it I will check out some of the other reviewers ideas and definitely make sure they are peeled and pureed. ', ""          A great light, fruity dessert for summer. I cooked the plums much longer, removing the skins along the way, and used regular evaporated milk -- no fat means no texture when you whip it. I also chilled the bowl first, just like when you whip cream, to make it as light and airy as possible. Next time, I think I'll cut the lemon juice by half, it doesn't need that extra tartness and I want more of the plum flavor to come through. I may also try reducing some of the plum juice, or even use that instead of water for the gelatine. ""]"
Ponche de Frutas (Fruit Punch),"['          i made as written. and it was way to sweet.

The subtle blending of the multiple flavours work wonderfully together.  I was skeptical about adding the tea, but was pleasently surprised at it's non overpowering presense, instead it brought the taste of the fruit even more to the forefront.  I would reccomend this recipe to anyone looking for a drink to satisfy all.  Plus with it's added attraction of the fresh fruit floating on top, it makes an eye pleasing addition to any table.

Rogaliki (Polish Jam-Filled Crescents),"['          These turned out delicious. Delicious, but not picture perfect. I thought I had a pound and a half  of butter in the fridge. Well no, I had 3 and a half sticks. (Crud!!) So I halved the recipe.  Then I proceeded to add to my confusion by cutting the dough log into 1.5 inch sections. Since I only had half the amount of dough for the recipe I should have cut it into 3 inch sections.  So the dough circles were too small and consequently the triangles were about half the size they should have been. This made them difficult to fill and roll. Oh well! I had bite-size Rogaliki.Besides making them small, the only deviation I made was with the yeast. Even with starting out with the milk at room temperature, after 12 minutes in a nice warm spot it had not even started to proof.  I stirred in about a half teaspoon of white sugar to kick-start the process. It worked. The yeast foamed up within 5 minutes. ', '          loved them! ']"

Plum Buckle,"['          This is a very colorful dessert, but ...1) Pressed for time, I had to skip the sweet crumble topping, but for me, the fruit part was way too tart (this being what happens to sweet, ripe plums when cooked), and needed separate sweetening.2) To be honest, the method of incorporating the ingredients was mystifying to me.  First of all, when did 2/3 c. butter mixed with 1 1/2 cups sugar ever become ""smooth and creamy""? Then, after adding the eggs, how does one ""stir in"" a whole 3 cups of flour? Why not sift the dry ingredients  separately and then add them alternately with the first part of the milk (the usual process with cakes)?This cake does take much longer to bake than most.

The cake will soak up the plum juice quickly, turning it in to a bread pudding. If you don‚Äôt like it like this, reduce the plums to 4 cups or as low as 2 cups finely chopped.

I harvested about 6 pomegranates from my backyard bush within a week of making the jelly. This is the first year I got more than two fruits, so I was excited to make jelly. Unfortunately I only got 1 1/2 cups of clear juice, so I had to scale back the amounts stated by this recipe. I kept the same proportions though. I also used pectin extracted from 3 pounds of crab apples. Another website stated that it was a guesstimate as to how much ""natural pectin"" to use, so I was a little hazy  about using the proper amount. I ended up using 4 ""ice cubes"" of my crab apple pectin (maybe about 6 TB total?). The boiled mixture thickened slightly when I cooled it and poured into my jars. So disappointed I only filled two 8oz. jars! But I can\'t wait to try the jelly...it looks amazingly clear! ', '          I made this using fruit from the tree including fresh lemon juice. I did as suggested and put the pectin in the juice bring it to a boil for 30 seconds prior to adding the sugar.   This set up perfectly every time.

This makes a great gift because it can be used for so many things from holiday dinner to a simple toasted bagel. Yum ', '          We just love Pom jelly. This recipe is good, but I reduced the sugar to 4 cups, doubled the pectin.  PLENTY sweet, can still taste Pom.  Used fresh juice.  We juice ours by tossing a couple cups at a time of fresh kernels in the blender and pulse just a couple times, then strain into the cookpot with doubled cheesecloth or a tea towel. ', ""          This jelly is good but WOW is it sweet. I have to admit when I read the reviews saying to reduce sugar I thought it was just people who don't like sweets, so I made the recipe using the full 7 1/2 cups sugar.  Dang, wow...it should definitely be reduced!  To put this in perspective for you , I literally ate cookie dough for breakfast this morning. I'm not afraid of sugar!  I added extra lemon juice to try and cut the sweetness and it helped a little, next time I'll reduce it by a cup like the suggestions said in the first place.  As other reviewers suggested I added the pectin (powdered) to the juice, boiled and the added sugars and  boiled again, it's jelling fine. Also, a jelly tip to reduce bubbles ( and skimming) add a little bit of butter right before you're ready to fill jars, the bubbles dissipate. ""]"
Lamb Braised in Pomegranate,"['          I made this in a one-pot, using lamb shanks, by braising the meat on brown, then the onions.

The only reason you might not like it is you just don't like lamb.  Made it exactly as written and served with couscous.  One recommendation, buy pomegranate juice, do not try to make it from pomegranates.  It took me an hour and 3 pomegranates to make 2 cups and was not worth it in my estimation.

The vinegar was way too strong. I made the recipe as written, then made a lot of tweaks to get it the right taste for our family. My recommendations: Cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and increase the pomegranate juice to 1-1/2 cups. (I reduced 2 cups pomegranate juice on the stove to about 1 cup reduction in a subsequent attempt at this recipe and liked it even better so you may play with the pomegranate juice.)

Pear and Pomegranate Salad,"[""          I need to learn an easier way to remove the pomegranate seeds.

I used romaine, but I think it would be better with spinach (unfortunately one of our guests can't eat spinach).  My disappointment was with the salad dressing.  It just didn't pack much of a punch.  The mustard in the dressing was a nice touch, but in the end it was a little bland. "", '           I added a bit more mustard to the dressing,  and topped with some feta cheese.

I did add quite a bit of crushed ice which didn‚Äôt dilute the flavor it too badly, used vanilla Greek yogurt and  pomegranate-blueberry juice (both what I had on hand) and was quite happy with the taste.  As I always do with smoothies that have oatmeal, I first ground/pulverized the oats in the blender and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Pretty good, but it does either need frozen blueberries or ice IMO and at least for me, I'll cut the cinnamon in half if I make this again. "", ""          Okay, this was interesting. It was not quite thick like other smoothies I make. It tasted like blueberry yogurt juice. Only changes I made was using frozen blueberries and cutting the amount of sweetener in half and it was plenty. Not a smoothie I would make again, as it was too thin for my taste and I am just not a fan of smoothies with more than a couple of Tablespoons of yogurt.

(or whatever type of liquid you use) and I added 1 pint of fresh raspberries once the relish was finished cooking.  I use the same amt of spices every year because WE LIKE IT ""spicy"".  I also had to make the pomegranate version as well, and NO, the pom seeds are not supposed to ""get soft"" as a couple ppl mentioned that theirs didn\'t. The point of the pom seeds if you use them is that they ADD A CRUNCH to this sauce.  :)  As long as you keep the liquid/cranberries in the same proportion and follow the directions for cooking this, you can do whatever you want with this ""recipe"". Few spices? Fine. Booze for liquid? Try it! Grated citrus zest....yes, please! Added fruits? Sure!  Last year I made some with 1 cup of apple juice and chopped up an apple to add plus stirred in some toasted walnuts at the end. THAT was really good! ', ""          The flavors worked well together.

My whole family loves it, including my kids who look forward to it.  My favorite part of the recipe is the ground cloves and cinnamon.  The spices add so much flavor and smell so good while cooking!

Pomegranate Stew with Chicken (Khoresh Fesenjan),"['          There are 2 types of Fesenjan, sour and sweet. I like the sour one better.

I'll make no changes to this dish the next time I make it, it's perfect as is. "", ""          Amazing flavor and texture. My kids gobble it down. Made a substitution of 1 part cinnamon and 1 part ginger since I couldn't find cardamom in my local grocery store. Making it again tonight for dinner! "", ""          I make this dish whenever I get the chance. Using full pomegranate juice defintely results in a tart end product, but the sugar and spices really work well with it. I generally use drumsticks, but boneless/skinless thighs reduce the work and chicken breast can be cooked with it a little later in the process (so they don't dry out). Sometimes I add a little cinnamon/ground cloves as well. Paired with rice and/or flatbread and some plain yogurt it makes a fantastic meal. Everyone who has tried it has raved and asked for the recipe. Can also be converted to a crockpot cooking method, though the flavors don't seem to come through as well. Leftovers are also very good. Just an all-around winner! "", ""          This was absolutely delicious. I used chicken thighs and substituted 4 whole green cardamom pods for the 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I also added 2 cups of  fresh carrot chunks, which nicely balanced the tartness of the pomegranate juice (instead of using sugar).  The sauce didn't thicken sufficiently for my taste so I boiled it down to the desired thickness. "", ""          I've always loved fesenjan but had no idea it'd be so simple to make. This turned out great! Thank you! "", '          AWESOME!! I make this receipe almost every week. ', '          I substituted two cans of whole chickpeas for the chicken and it came out as a really nice vegetarian meal. ', '          I made this last night.  My sauce did turn out a nice brown color. I used chicken thighs (took the skin off).  I am wondering when reading other\'s reviews if they did not use PURE pomegranate juice? Maybe this is why it was too sweet or an odd color!? Omitted the sugar as well.  It can be confusing because in the Juice shelves of most grocery stores there will be ""Pomegranate Juice 100% Juice"" but it\'s mostly grape juice and other fruit juices!  What I did is get 2 pomegranates and juice them myself, so that was time consuming to do. I had to look up a Youtube video ""How to Juice a Pomegranate""  Anyway, the juice was tart and gave the dish a good flavor. 2 pomegranates = 1.5 C of juice and I did use Organic chicken broth 3/4 C of that.  Great suggestion from others!   I added to my liking in addition to the Cardamom: 1/2 tsp of Tumeric, and I also seeded a small Serrano pepper and tossed that in whole to give the dish some heat.  I liked my additions, it was super good over Indian Basmati Rice!   Another reviewer suggested shredding the chicken off the bone and I did that right in the saucepan after it had been simmering for an hour or so.  It was  unique, very flavorful. I also made the Persian Cucumber Yogurt salad and got some store bought Wood Fired Naan flatbread to go with it.  YUM.  I only gave it 4 stars because the time consuming issue of the pomegranates and not finding the juice in the store, so this recipe might not be very convenient for some people to make. ']"

In a  large deep bowl,  take the pomegranate and pull apart over the bowl.  Take each quarter and place it skin side up in one hand with your fingers open.  In your other hand, take a wooden spoon and whack the skin side of the pomegranate.  The seeds just fall out.  Don't be afraid to hit fairly hard.

Khoresht Fesenjaan (Chicken with Pomegranate Sauce),"['          This came out really tasty, will definitely be making again. I used a whole chicken and baked in a dutch oven.

However, I love trying new foods and was interested in seeing what this would turn out like.  I thought it was interesting although not sure I'm a huge fan.  Hubs was not a fan at all and wanted to know where the other leftovers were.  He ate this but wasn't thrilled.  I'm thinking his dislike stems from the cardamom, which he hasn't really seemed to like in any dish.  I'm also willing to admit this could totally be my fault that we didn't like it--I did leave out the saffron because I'm not interested in using an expensive spice just for the color.  I love saffron for the flavor.  However, I did base that decision on the one review that mentioned it, so perhaps if I'd kept it in we would've enjoyed it more.  Thanks for the recipe!

However, for some reason it didn't work.  I tasted the sauce and it seemed fine before I put it in the oven, but after two hours, it looked and tasted gross.  There was no flavour and I couldn't taste the saffron at all.  I'm pretty sure that I did something wrong, as this recipe is fantastic in Persian restaurants.

This is supposed to be a very difficult Persian dish to make and it was my first time ever making the dish, but the recipe is so straight-forward and easy to follow.

I measured everything out exactly, and for 10 ounces of kale, there wasn't nearly enough dressing. This was a very dry salad. I would double the dressing. I'd also add a touch of sweetness to it, such as raw honey, as the dressing is very tangy.  I felt this could have used some cheese, such as crumbled feta or goat cheese.

This a very sweet bread, I'd classify as dessert.  I think cutting some of the sugar wouldn't hurt it at all.  Four large persimmons netted us 3.5 cups of pulp which we blended in 2 smoothie cups.  Probably would have been 4 cups, but my daughter didn't scrape the skins as well as I did.  I only had larger or smaller loaf pans than specified, so this recipe made two 8 x 4 loaves.

If you're lucky and they do, then you can skip freezing them.I only had enough persimmons for 3/4 recipe. I inadvertantly added the full amount for the rest of the ingredients. I also added a dash of cinnamon and a tiny pinch of cloves. It turned out delicious! I then used the persimmon jam in rugelach .

Spiced Persimmon Butter,"[""          The recipe is great, but there advice by another person reviewing it is somewhat dangerous.

It was a little on the salty side, and even with the toffee bits, they are not sweet enough for me (and my 3yo son spit it out and said it was yucky).  I'm new to persimmons, so I don't have much recipe experience to compare to, but I couldn't taste the flavor of persimmon at all- just the spices (and salt) I added in.

The reason for making this recipe, for me was to try persimmon, I had never used persimmon or had ever tasted one I wanted to learn about them.  I let the persimmon ripe for about a week and when I went to peel the persimmon I noticed it had a feel black spots and then the rest was hard not easy to mash I was not sure if the Persimmon was good or not but I carried on making the muffins.  I didn't read all the steps first before making the muffins and I add all the ingredients in the first step together without mixing before adding the next ingredient.  The first thing I noticed was the big chunks of persimmon and the coconut oil hardening.  but I left them like that I thought maybe the would taste good like that ..After mixing all the ingredients and pouring into prepared muffins cups the batter ended up making 9 muffins I don't know whether this was because of the chunks persimmons but i had to use a  turkey baster to get all the water out of each extra muffin cup until I used up all the batter.

Persimmon Cheesecake,"['          It was hard to get a smooth consistency even with a hand mixer on high.

I disagree with the reviewers who said that it was too runny, or didn't have enough persimmon taste. I didn't strain my persimmon puree at all, and my cheesecake had the perfect, creamy texture and a whole lot of persimmon taste. Since I used a crushed gingersnap cookie crust, I omitted the ginger in the cake and used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead. I also didn't do the sour cream topping. Instead I served it with fresh whipped cream. Awesome cheesecake. Can't wait to serve it to friends.

My kids and husband both said it was better than they thought it would be. Based on the picture, I chose to do one Bundt-shaped bread instead of two loaves (mostly because I thought my kids would be more likely to eat it if it were shaped like a cake). Anyway, I sprinkled some raw sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter, so it had a sweet, crunchy top to it. I really liked the seasonings that make me think of fall/winter holidays. I baked for 1 hour, but probably should have taken it out 5 minutes earlier using the Bundt pan, but still it was was moist and yummy.

I won't be making this again. "", '          So quick and easy and delicious! I thought 1 Tb of cinnamon sounded like a lot, but it was perfect! Smelled divine while it was baking too.

Persimmon Raisin Cookies,"['          I made these and followed one persons review by adding 3  cups of flour instead of four. I also made the persimmon pulp and raisin paste.

Wasn't able to find raisin paste so I hydrated some raisins and chopped them up in a food processor.  I may try one less cup of flour to see if it will make a crisp cookie. "", '           This was a very tasty cookie!  I made a couple of changes out of necessity:  I used raisins vs. raisin paste.   I also substituted 1 Cup of apple sauce for 1 Cup of the persimmons and increased the flour by 1/2 cup to compensate.  The result was a flavorfilled cakey cookie that was perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee!  My husband took a batch to work and told me they were such a hit, the plate was empty within minutes! ', '          They took a lot longer to cook more like 18 to 20 minutes. They came out well, however if I were to make this recipe again I would add the persimmon pulp in with the wet ingredients and then add the dry ingredients. It was extremely difficult to mix up these cookies the way that it is written. I exchanged half of the white sugar with brown sugar and left out the raisins. ', '          fabulous and flavorful ']"

Persimmon Pudding Pie,"['           The texture was perfect as a pudding; I used less sugar at 1 1/2 c. and probably could have used a bit less, since my hachiya persimmons were fully ripe, soft and the pulp was super sweet.

Sandra's Persimmon Pudding,"[""          This is an easy way to create a persimmon pudding.

I had 3 persimmons, so that's what I used, I did not measure them, I just peeled them and stuck them in the blender...I also used 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/4 of skim milk instead of the 1 1/4 c milk it called for...then I added a dash of ground cloves and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked it in a glass pie dish for 40 minutes and it is absolutely delicious and set up perfectly.  I like it a little thicker, so the pie dish worked beautifully for my taste.  I was not expecting such wonderful results since I so loosely followed the directions.  It was a little lighter in color than I remember my grandmothers being, but it was also fluffier - I'm not sure that's the right word because persimmon pudding is by no means fluffy, but regardless, I really like it and I can't wait for my husband to get home and try it.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe - I will make it again and again!  (I also like the fact that there is no liquor in this recipe.

Spicy Persimmon Chutney,"['          Way too much vinegar!!!!  So disappointed. ', '           Made it just as recommended but added a handful of pomegranate.

I will make it again-- but will use for a half batch -- about 1/3 c. and will balance out the remaining liquid with either apple juice or apple juice/water.

With less vinegar, it might be OK at room temperature. ', ""          I quadrupled this recipe so I could can it and give as holiday gifts. Glad the previous reviewers suggested using less vinegar; I used 1/2 of what was called for,  substituting other 1/2 for water.

Also good if added to creamy base (i.e. butternut) and turned into soup. "", ""          Yumdeliciousness! I didn't have some of the ingredients and it still worked great as a basic recipe.  Reduced the amount of vinegar to about 3/4 cup as per previous reviewer's suggestion and it still tasted pretty acidic; I'd keep reducing it even further (the lemon juice also adds acidity!).  I didn't use raisins or chile peppers; instead, put in some cumin and Southwestern seasoning and powdered ginger (a key ingredient in many Indian chutneys).

Sweet Persimmon Fireside Cookies,"['           This has a light persimmon taste and smells wonderful.

I liked the flavor, though it is mild and if I make it again I would try to jazz it up a little more, maybe with nuts, raisins and more spices. I found the dough to be thick, sticky and difficult to work with, so I may not make them again solely for that reason. "", ""          Easy enough but not much flavor.

Banana Chocolate Chip Bread,"[""          This is my go-to for banana bread. I've made this 20 times. This is important- if you don't dust your chocolate chips in flour FIRST, they will ALWAYS sink to the bottom of your pan and collect in a pile on the bottom. Dust them in flour just until they are coated (don't add the leftover dusting flour), and then FOLD them in at the very last minute before you pour it into your loaf pans. Look at the photos and especially the video. All the chips are on the bottom. If you coat the chips in flour, they don't sink to the bottom, and remain more evenly distributed throughout the bread. ps- Please don't tweak the recipe with other ingredients and then give it only 3 stars.

Meaning: Add sugar, flour, salt to the pan and heat at medium heat for a minute or so then add the milk very slowly. Very. Slowly. A little at a time-a quarter cup or less each pour. Whisking throughly and constantly; incorporating fully before adding more milk. I also set the egg yolks out so they‚Äôre room temperature before incorporating. I hope this helps! Fantastic recipe!

I read many of the reviews about a soupy mess and was a little concerned. Well the exact thing also happened to me. it turned out thinner than my pudding with same amount of milk and half the cornstarch. Why?  As a Home Economist, I knew there was a reason. My belief is that it was either over cooked (too high a heat) or under stirred. Custards creams can lose their structure with high heat.  Undercooking and under stirring can also be a problem.  I was working in a different kitchen with a lower quality pot and a new stove. I will try again because my thin custard over broken up graham wafer crust in a bowl topped with whipped cream tasted great! Banana cream pudding.  My guests asked for seconds. I gave it 3 stars for the taste. ']"

The recipe I did not change at all. However, I think it is for jumbo muffins and I used regular. So to my surprise, I had a lot more mix and broke out a second muffin pan and made 18. In doing this I did adjust the cooking time so they wouldn't burn. The prep time (let's be real... 15 minutes is having everything premeasured and in front of you ready to go)  it's more like 30-40 minutes and that's me cleaning as I go - putting dirty things in the dishwasher, not actually washing. I had a cooking time of 16 minutes (I like my muffins on the light and moist side). It was exactly 1 hour from start to finish turning the oven off. Cooling time was additional. I took them out of the muffin tins after 5 minutes so they wouldn't keep cooking. And they were deeelicious!!! "", '          Loved this recipe. Better than anything store bought.

For the past reviewers who had a watery outcome, I experienced this too and I figured out why! I accidentally bought the ""cook and serve"" instant pudding. Since I had already bought all the ingredients and made it this far I decided to heat the mixture to boiling like the pudding box instructions said and then put it in the freezer about 20ish minutes to cool. That thickened it right up! Next I added the cool whip and followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great!
