2883	344	Delicious
2884	344	These are wonderful.  I would suggest weighing your flour if you find these dry…1 cup equals 120 gm.  They are perfection when you weigh your flour.
2885	345	Terrible! Would not recommend. They look nothing like the picture.
2886	345	Not at ALL like the picture. A food dehydrator may have worked. Mine were black, stuck and not even the texture of gummy worms. Lemon did not make bananas not turn brown.
2899	346	Easy, and quite flavorful...was worried about the garlic quantity, but the taste was mild...my husband and brother said it was a keeper!
6	1	husband loved it !
7	1	Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner.
8	1	This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
9	1	Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning.
10	1	I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make
11	1	Didn't have much flavor to the "filling".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart.
12	2	I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It’s a keeper!
13	2	Go to recipe for all holidays!  I usually add cinnamon and nutmeg to sugar mixture.Pie dough excellent for all pies.Love it!
14	2	I was very hesitant at first after looking at the ingredients I did exactly as instructed and could not believe the taste! This pie is, hands down, the best apple pie I have ever made!! You won’t be disappointed. Have one in the over now, added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and left the top crust whole. Can’t wait to see how this one turns out. It will be wonderful I am sure!!
15	2	Excellent!  I followed the directions as written.  I let the pie cool for 45 minutes before slicing, and it was not runny at all; just perfect!  It's very rich for us so I will be making this as a holiday dessert item. But most likely for ALL holidays.  It's that good!
16	2	I've made this pie several times. Always a hit with the crowd.
17	2	I loved the recipe, I did add my own little touch by add a little bit of cinnamon in to the pastry (dough), and added extra cinnamon in to the pie, just because I love cinnamon so much😍😍😍
18	2	This is the best Apple pie I've ever tasted
19	2	Lori stop reinventing the recipe. am a chef and have made this pie for as long as I can remember and it has never disappointed. do not mix the apples with the sauce, a lot of water in apples
20	2	granny apples, pinch of nutmeg, egg wash, great pie
21	3	Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples
22	3	Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough.
23	3	Yum good easy
24	3	Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it!
25	3	I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too.
26	3	Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again.
27	3	Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn’t made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again!
28	3	I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER!
29	3	Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much.
30	4	Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum!
31	4	It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water.
32	4	I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it’s in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought
33	4	I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe!
34	4	Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream!
35	4	Very very good as is.  Used glass dish.
36	4	the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!!
37	4	Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious.
38	4	Love it!
39	5	I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again.
79	9	I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this "apple rings".
2900	346	Very easy to make and a hit with my fiancé!
2901	346	Wouldn't feed this to a coyote.
40	5	I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better.
41	5	5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great!
42	5	Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect.
43	5	This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using.
44	5	no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half.
45	5	Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies
46	5	I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome
47	5	Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my "go to" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp.
48	6	I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!!
49	6	I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it.
50	6	Made it in a 9x13" pan (9" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe.
51	6	Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream.
52	6	I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!
53	6	easy to make and my friends all loved it!!
54	6	Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect.
55	6	My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-)))
56	6	Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious!
57	7	Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving.
58	7	Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!!
59	7	I don’t even like cider but this was AMAZING!!!
60	7	I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self.
61	7	You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good!
62	7	I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd
63	7	Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange
64	7	This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good!
65	7	I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.
66	8	Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect.
67	8	My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!!
68	8	Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples)
69	8	Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out.
70	8	Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.
71	8	Love, Love, Love!
72	8	I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.
73	8	Just used a little less sugar for the crumb topping.   I used dried cranberries which worked well.   Delicious!!!
74	8	Wonderful! This will be my go-to for crisps from now on!
75	9	I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS!
76	9	I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream!
77	9	I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they’re in the oven now and I can’t wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I’ve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G
78	9	Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm.
115	13	Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again.
80	9	Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough
81	9	Smells amazing!!
82	9	Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn’t used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!!
83	9	Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty.
84	10	I varied the recipe slightly1/2 c+ 1 T butter1/2 c white sugar1/2 c brown sugar1 T Cinnamon1/2 T NutmegI used a little extra butter because one of my apples was quite a bit larger than the rest. By NO stretch of the imagination am I a cook, so if I can do it, literally anyone can!It turned out fantastic. I'll definitely make this again!
85	10	My family loves these.  I make 2 versions as my son is diabetic. For his I use Stevia and for the rest of the family I make the regular recipe
86	10	Great pair with pork tenderloin.  So yummy.
87	10	Im a mediocre cook and this was extremely simple amd turned out delicious and that was with not a thing changed THANK YOU
88	10	I think they mean teaspoons not tablespoons of cinnamon.  The way it is written makes it overpowering.
89	10	So I changed it a bit.1/2 cup of unsalted butter1/2 white sugar1/2 brown sugar1 1/2 tb. Cinnamon1/2 tb. Nutmeg4 Granny Smith applesIt’s amazing
90	10	This is absolutely amazing!! i did however make another batch with brown sugar and it was SO GOOD! im 100% making this again
91	10	Follow recipe not changes pretty good going to make pancakes tomorrow and use up the rest of it
92	10	Just added a little more cinnamon
93	11	These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.
94	11	These turnovers were amazingly delicious! So fluffy and not too sweet.  I added a little lime to the glaze and sprinkled some pecans. I’m definitely, making them again.
95	11	I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
96	11	Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples.
97	11	I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious!
98	11	These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious!
99	11	Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group.
100	11	I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don’t hold enough filling.
101	11	Easy to make and delicious when using Careme all butter puff frozen pastry.
102	12	Loved this recipe. So easy and my family all love it and say it's the best apple crisp ever. I  wouldn't change a thing. Perfect as is.
103	12	I love it, simple, quick and oh so good. will be making again and again.
104	12	Great recipe but I used brown sugar and less and CERTAINLY no need for salt.Add half oats as well as a change
105	12	This was delicious.  I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Plenty sweet.  Also, added one bag of instant oatmeal.  Yummy!
106	12	Loved it added more apples than suggested and added oats.
107	12	Easy apple crisp recipe which I was I was looking for.  I did add 3 cups of apples, rather than 2 1/2, but followed the remaining ingredients.  It turned out exactly as I hoped.  Very good recipe!
108	12	It was quick and delicious. I’m making it again this evening but adding more apples and reducing the sugar
109	12	Very good and simple. I added 1/2 cup sugar and t cinnamon to apples and 1/2 cup oatmeal to topping.
110	12	this is so easy and the best recipe yet! family loves it .
111	13	So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed .
112	13	I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my "appeal" factor.  ❤️❤️☺️
113	13	Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i’m sure less butter would do the trick
114	13	Carmel just slid off
211	24	This is my go to canning recipe for apple butter
116	13	This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn’t have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe!
117	13	I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.
118	13	The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe.
119	13	Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have "helpers" in the kitchen, but I'm so happy!
120	14	I make it at leat once a month.  We love it!
121	14	fantastic. added extra curry
122	14	This is one the greatest soups I have ever tasted. Highly recommend, I will be making this often.
123	14	I made this recipe as is, and have made it over and over again.  It is simple, and flavorful, and I highly recommend it.  If you aren't into curry, or Indian spice flavor profiles then this probably isn't your thing.  Otherwise it is amazing!
124	14	this was perfect as written
125	14	Excellent! Turned out exactly as described. I doubled the curry powder based on other reviews, yum! PS, I had leftover roasted chicken breast so I cubed that and added the chicken the last few minutes.
126	14	Delicious! Used a Granny Smith apple might try a sweeter one next time. I brown the chicken pieces before adding to soup.
127	14	Powerfully good! Best soup I’ve ever made.Went by the recipe, but used cooked rotisserie chicken that I added the last 10 minutes of cooking.Wow!
128	14	I had never had Mulligatawny soup, but wanted to give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is a wonderful soup, I did forget the cream at the end, but I loved it anyway.  This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup!
129	15	Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish.
130	15	I have used this for years as written.  Just be careful not to turn the apples into apple sauce.
131	15	Absolutely delicious! Apples need longer than 6-7 minutes if more than one layer in the pan.
132	15	Very tasty!
133	15	Made these apples and the family loved them.  They said it was as good as Cracker Barrel’s Apples.
134	15	As is, this recipe is so good, it made my house smell wonderful!  But I was hoping for a bit more of an apple pie filling taste, so I added a touch more brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added maybe 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.  This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream.
135	15	My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you
136	15	FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I’ll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).
137	15	It was delicious!
138	16	I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider.
139	16	This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect!
140	16	Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps!
141	16	Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe!
142	16	Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity!
635	9	Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty.
143	16	Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again.
144	16	Delicious.
145	16	I used Cloves instead of AllSpice because I just did not have any in the spice rack. Turned out tasty.
146	16	I just made this recipe, it turned out great, I like it. I’m used to having hot cider made from the packets so I was surprised when it didn’t take as sweet as that, but I really like it.
147	17	Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.
148	17	Love the recipe,  quick and easy.  Taste great. My only thing is I have so much liquid,  don't look like it will fill a pie shell. What should I do next time?
149	17	Fast and easy to make. The apple pie filling is so good I can eat it out of the jar. I will use this recipe from now on! I did not use food color or lemon juice.
150	17	I've been making this for years. Here's a tip. Divide sauce equally between 7 quart jars, then add sliced apples and push from top down until full. Much less messy.
151	17	Love it! I used clear gel instead of cornstarch , came out amazing!!
152	17	I've made lots of different apple pie fillings, but this was by far my favorite. It turned out beautiful and SO yummy! I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg, but followed everything else as written. I already can't wait to whip up another batch for gifts. Thanks!
153	17	I didn't pre-congeal the syrup as it became virtually impossible to get into the jar around the apples.  It will boil up in the jar as it cans anyway, so I am conducting an experiment.  I got 100# of Honey Crisps, so anything that makes this more efficient will be GREAT.
154	17	I love this recipe!  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers though, and my house smells like Autumn.
155	17	I liked the recipe. The filling is tasty. This also freezes quite good. I have had a jar that did not seal. Instead of reprocessing the jar, I put the filling in a quart freezer bag and froze it and it tasted the same as the stuff in the jars.
156	18	I was very unhappy with the outcome of this pie. It ended up extremely watery.
157	18	I did not make any changes. This is a definite keeper.
158	18	no changes it came out perfect
159	18	Followed the recipe.  Yummy!
160	18	added brown sugar and vanilla came out great!
161	18	Really simple to make, apples still crisp
162	18	Instead of using store bought crust I did make it at home but it still tasted delicious
163	18	No I have not made any changes. Except we used margirin. We love the recipe
164	18	Made  as printed YUMMY
165	19	Rock-solid recipe. Followed it closely, but also added crushed pecans and in the second one, a small box of raisins, too. Tossed in a shake of ground clove to the apple coating. I used Gala apples that were just a bit too soft for eating, IMO. Keebler shortbread crust.
166	19	This pie tasted great, however the crumb is soggy after the first day, so I probably won’t be making it again. I liked that the apples were sliced thinly so that they were cooked thru and softened, rather than just cutting the apple into 8ths. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to make the sauce thicker. That was a good idea.
167	19	This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.  I only had one crust so I just made a crumble in a 2nd pie dish.  Even so, there was enough crumble for both pies.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
168	19	The recipe turned out really great I prefer no nuts in mine it was really easy to make and it's absolutely beautiful.
169	19	Yummo!  Came out perfect the 1st time.
170	19	I did make this pie but was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the crumb part. The crumb didn't come out the same way that it has in my past.
171	19	It turned out okay but needed to cook way longer than 25 minutes and not a lot of topping
172	19	This turned out to be one of the best apple pies I’ve ever made!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!
173	19	Easy to make and delicious.
174	20	It's the easiest
175	20	I made 50 caramel apples for an event. I was able to find very fresh Honeycrisp apples that were also fairly small. I used 8 lbs of caramels and about 1/2 cup of milk (maybe a bit more). This was very easy (except for the time involved in unwrapping 8 lbs of caramels!). I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick. Definitely freeze the apples first and take the advice to dip the apples in boiling water before freezing to remove the wax. These were a big hit and several people said they were the best caramel apples they had ever eaten!
176	20	Best caramel apples we've ever made!  Followed the recipe and forgot to add the vanilla this time.  Still turned out great.
177	20	Very simple and fun to make.  I made the mistake of putting the apples in the freezer overnight then putting the caramel and toppings on the next day.  They were so soggy when we ate them.  Definitely going to be refrigerating them only 15 min beforehand.
178	20	Awesome. Extremely easy tastes great
179	20	Tips from reviews:
180	20	Worked great!
181	20	Even after refrigerating it for 10 minutes (as some other users suggested), it was still super gooey and the caramel layer was thin because it was so gooey. I won’t be making this recipe again..
182	20	sound  good
183	21	This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome. Will be making this for Easter dinner this year. Thank you.
184	21	We made several changes and swaps due to what was on hand and personal preference- 1 1/2c sugar, 4c frozen blueberries instead of apples, tablespoon of dried lavender instead of cinnamon, melted butter instead of oil. It was more like a cookie dough than cake batter and baked closer to an hour (guessing because blueberries are juicier than apples) but came out amazing
185	21	Absolutely delicious! Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!!
210	24	I halfed the recipe because i didn't have that many apples. I also forgot to add the apple cider vinegar. But still came out yummy.
186	21	German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe—Use 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the “oily sloppy mess” issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don’t like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake—sprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time—I cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it’s always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn’t high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won’t burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it’ll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick “raw batter” on it, it’s done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone!
187	21	Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can’t go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease.
188	21	The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting.
189	21	I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples.
190	21	I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster. Although it was followed precisely, the „apple cake“ turned into a soggy mess, was far too sweet and left an oily residue on the plate. I would not do this cake again.
191	21	Very easy to make.  Baked well and tastes delicious!!!
192	22	Excellent.  Added one beaten egg to hold it together more. Doubled the stock (homemade) and doubled the butter. I'll chop the cranberries very small next time and reduce the amount. Used real herbs. Used pork sausage/less sodium.  Baked 40 min w foil. Uncover and bake another 20.
193	22	The best stuffing I have ever made for 9 years now. My Father in law requested to cook for him on Christmas as my gift. My family loves it ❤️
194	22	I have made this recipe for over 10 years now.  My entire family adores it!  And many people ask for the recipe.  I have made Gluten and Dairy free very easily.  I also don't stuff the turkey, I bake at 350 for 30-45 min.
195	22	Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I think it’s a great recipe and everyone  liked it.  It will be even better next time because I’ll improve on these mistakes I made.  I used two different densities of bread; one disintegrated and the other was a little dry.  I will not double it next time because for 15 guests with several other side dishes there was a lot left over.
196	22	I’ve been making this stuffing for over 20 years now, and it’s always been a huge hit w/everyone! This year I used 1/2 loaf“Dave’s whole wheat bread w/seeds”, along with the traditional 3/4 bag of sage and onion stuffing. [ I’m diabetic, and am trying to use mostly whole wheat bread ] I soaked my cranberries in fresh squeezed orange juice, to plump up, before adding them to my stuffing. (Yummy little pop of citrus!) I used Turkey stock, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the recipe. I also used 3 small Granny Smith apples chopped up. It tastes delicious & my husband can’t stop trying bites as he travels through the kitchen. LolI plan on stuffing my brined Turkey tomorrow, and cooking the rest in a pan lined with parchment paper (buttered) and will add a bit of Turkey stock if needed, as it cooks.Best recipe ever! :)Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
197	22	This is my go-to stuffing recipe and my family members have asked for the recipe. I had to double the broth though, 3/4 cup just isn't enough.
198	22	Everyone loves when I make this. Especially me.
199	22	I have been making this stuffing for years now. My family loves loves loves it!
200	22	This has been a favorite every year for at least a decade. I cannot imagine a family Thanksgiving without it. My children, who are now grown, are continuing the tradition with their own families. I have never had anyone not like it. In fact, it is the first dish to run out.
201	23	I made the dough and the apple filling. Didn't change anything. Well, I halved the filling recipe because I was short an apple, but it was delicious.
202	23	This recipes is great. I added a touch of flour to the cinnamon in the last step for a little thickener.
203	23	I made them exactly as the recipe stated. But the crust split open while baking. Not sure why but it still tasted great.
204	23	I quadrupled the recipe to make  16 hand pies.   The apple cooked good and tasted great but I had to remove 1-1/2 cups of liquid from the frying pan because it was very watery.
205	23	Beautiful and delicious! I did follow some reviews and halved the white sugar. My family does not like extra sweet. I also added some lemon juice to the apples, a little cinnamon, and some vanilla. I used homemade pie dough and my handy dandy new mini pie press. Lovely result!
206	23	wonderful pies.  I added about 2 tsp more cinnamon, and only used brown sugar in the apple mixture.
207	23	Made this today.  Took longer to cook down the apples than expected but eventually they got to the right consistency. Dough took me awhile to properly roll out because I’m very inexperienced and used very chilled dough. Didn’t help I made a double batch. In spite of my ineptitude they came out GREAT!  If a doufus like me can have a success with this recipe then it’s a solid keeper.
208	23	I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times, and it inspired me to try different flavors. My favorite is to spread each pastry round with a little mango chutney, then I mix together 1 cup chopped fresh spinach with 1 cup diced paneer and season with curry powder for the filling.
209	23	I tried these and loved them! Another time, I made these as a dinner pie switching the apples for chopped ham and broccoli, and instead of cinnamon and sugar I used some Dijon mustard. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top before baking. They were a big hit!
6941	877	My family loved it!
212	24	This turned out amazing.  I had a lot of apples that I needed to use so I made a double batch and I had two crockpots going. Both cooked at different temperatures so I had to make adjustments, but I had to cook on low for both of them.  I ran out of cloves so I only used a pinch of cloves but some family members don't care for cloves. I thought the allspice had enough clove in it to make sufficient without the cloves. Will be keeping this recipe and making it again.
213	24	I did not make as much as the recipe called for and appreciated the ability to change the amount through allrecipes.
214	24	Just finished canning this apple butter and it truly is amazing. So easy and the texture is perfect. Let it simmer overnight in my slow cooker. It did not scorch and by mid-morning it was ready to can. Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Love that it is so low in refined sugar compared to other recipes.
215	24	Actually made as directed, lil heavy handed on spices. Took lot longer in crock pot, to cook down than I expected, might try stove top next time, but Abble Butter was so Amazing, family raved.! But I would likecto Thank mostly for eady, step by step canning instructions,!!  It was my first, tryed other sites. But for me yours was so easy to understand. Turned out great, going to make more for gifts.
216	24	I made about 20 small jars of this apple butter and 10 fresh loaves of bread cut lengthwise to give me 2 loaves out of each. These were then given as Christmas gifts to all my family. They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy
217	24	Turned out great will make again
218	24	I am making it again now! This time I have added some pears as I needed to use them before they spoiled. Smells and tastes great!
219	25	Added 2 tbsp of sour cream, and used half brown and half white sugar.Made 12 delicious muffins
220	25	We loved these muffins. Shared them with my neighbor who loved them too. The recipe makes 12 normal size muffins. Does anyone know if they freeze well?
221	25	My family loves these muffins, but like many I too adjusted the recipe to my family's taste.  I am not a measuring kind of gal, but here is what I did. I split the sugar to about 1/3 white and 1/3 brown, added about a tsp of vanilla and a shake of nutmeg. I used 3 small gala apples cut into small chunks.  The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.  I cooked them a bit longer than the recipe recommended and then eyeballed them and checked the middle before removing them from the oven.  I would say they were in about 30 minutes.  They came out great!
222	25	These turned out amazing! I made mine gluten free with brown rice and 1/4 almond flour.  Used a little less butter for topping but melted it to mix easier. My husband said they taste like mini apple pies
223	25	Like a different review said, DON'T fill to top it will overflow. Also make sure the butter for the topping is room temp. Otherwise it doesn't turn out like a crumbly topping and it spills over.
224	25	Too much of butter topping, and 400 might be a bit too hot
225	25	I made regular sized muffins (12), and did not need all the topping. The amounts for the topping could have been cut in half. What I have left will be great tossed into pancake batter!! Yummy
226	25	I baked these this morning and they were great! I did some modifications as I’ve read some suggestions on the reviews - not filling it up to the brim, instead of white sugar, half of it was brown sugar, butter for topping was reduced to 1/4 cup! Turned out really well! Thank you for this recipe.
227	25	Good but followed the suggestions on the prior reviews.
228	26	This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.  I'm not sure why my 2 granny smith apples made 4 cups of chopped apples instead of the 2 cups the recipe called for, but I used all 4 cups.   I will definetly cut back to 2 cups.  It was a great bread anyway, just too many apples. I  had so much batter I made 6 muffins to be sure I had enough room in the bread pan.  This makes great muffins also!
229	26	I like the apple bread. I like baking it.
230	26	The bread did not raise - couldn't eat. I followed directions and put in the correct baking powder.
231	26	I read this recipe and it seemed just what I was looking for.  I had frozen apples I needed to use up.  I read the other reviews and I used a tip from one of the other reviews and used half light brown sugar and the other half the white sugar.  I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.  It is delicious and I am keeping this recipe as my go to apple bread recipe from now on. It did stick in my greased pan so next time I will either grease and flour or use parchment paper.  Thank you so much for this delicious treat.
232	26	I had to cook this bread for 30 minutes more than the recipe called for. And, when I tasted it, it was way too sweet. I think only one cup of sugar is more appropriate rather than two.
233	26	1/31/2023  I see by the earlier review I first made this bread in 2017!  Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in!
234	26	I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it.
235	26	Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.
236	26	This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe!
237	27	I didn’t think they had muchflavor . They puffed up a lot and weredark on outside and doughy inside.
238	27	Did not like this. I made as recipe called for. Dead apple fritters. No flavor. How do i remove this recipe. I would not make again. If i did i sure would add cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, more sugar.
239	27	This is exactly the same as my grandma's recipe that we made as kids. Yum! We would sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar or dip them in syrup.
240	27	This is a great and simple recipe!! My 5th time making it.  I made a few adjustments by adding 1/4c  of sugar, 4c of apples, 1tsp of vanilla, a bit more milk, and reducing the amt. of baking powder.  I also added 2 tbs. of melted butter instead of oil.  Next time I'll try adding a bit of almond extract.
241	27	I added a couple of splashes of milk in order to fully incorporate the dry ingredients.  I also added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg, and cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I'm super pleased with this recipe. The fritters were light and creamy. Definitely adding this to my recipes.
242	27	you will not find taste like this at your local store! these apple fritters are soft moist and fluffy, full of flavor, free of preservatives and must be eaten within a couple of days, best if consumed immediately after being prepared!
243	27	I added 1/2 T sugar, plus cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves; good that way and no glaze or cinnamon sugar was needed.
244	27	Almost exactly the same as my mom's recipe!  She always served with sausage patties, and we ate them with syrup. My daughters always  loved them for supper whenever their dad had to go out of town!
245	27	I disliked how crunchy the apples still were.
246	28	Use yellow cake mix  about a cup and half  instead of flour mix with butter and crumble ...a game changer.
247	28	Did not like the crumb topping.  Tasteless.  Is 1/4 cup brown sugar in recipe a typo?  Always disappointed when I try a new recipe and turns out it was just not worth the work.
248	28	I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The crumble on top reminded me of pie crust, and I thought it  tasted really good.
249	28	Pretty tasty. I added a little extra brown sugar. A tip for the butter. I freeze it and used a cheese grater to help cut it into the flour mixture. I also turned the broiler on to brown the top.
250	28	The topping is doughy. Not crispy at all.
251	28	I used apple pie filling that was sweetened with sucralose and Truvia brown sugar to make this a lower calorie dessert. No one even noticed.
252	28	It was literally ok, nothing more. Topping never crisped, took it out after 35 minutes. Topping just tastes like flour mostly with a little sugar. I’m the only one in my household that will eat it, no complaint there. Not the best but not the worst.
253	28	It took a good 30 minutes before it looked done. It sure did taste good though!
254	28	I used the suggestions to use oats and reduce the flour. 1 cup seemed like a lot of butter bit I gave it a fo anyway. t was so greasy!! The butter was pooling at the edges. I'm not a pro baker but I bake offen enough and have made apple crisp before but couldnt find the recipe I'd used previously so I tried this. Threw it in the garbage.
255	29	They forgot the liquid in the batter. I modified it by adding apple sauce and apple juice, plus I added cinnamon to the batter. They should remove or modify this recipe.
256	29	Needed to make something quick with my aging apples. It was simple, had all the ingredients I needed. But I did add cinnamon and allspice to my dry mix and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the wet. I debated cooking down the apples a bit before, but no need to.
257	29	Like other reviews, I have to add a bunch of milk to thin the batter out. I pour and mix until the creator tells me to stop! I add cinnamon to the flour mixture for an extra kick
258	29	I have made these twice, once with white flour and once with whole wheat flour, I use frozen sliced apples and they turned out great, will be my favorite go-to recipie.
259	29	These came out amazing! I followed the recipe- and several tips mentioned in reviews. Added cinnamon, allspice, and a splash of milk (oat milk) to the batter. Also seared the apple slices in butter before adding them which made them easier to mix into the batter. Everyone in the family loved them and we’re still snacking on them two days later.
260	29	These came out pretty good! I chopped granny smith apples into small pieces and let them sit in the sugar before adding to the mix, added all spice, and a splash of milk. They turned out delicious and were not dry!
261	29	These were quite tasty and easy to make.  Only took about 1.5 apples, I did not bother peeling and that worked out just fine.  I doubled the cinnamon in the topping to 1/4 tsp but next time I think I will also increase cinnamon in the topping and add cinnamon to the batter itself.  I think the recipe is a keeper but with more cinnamon.
262	29	Amazing … I did add milk to make the batter more liquidity, And added a sprinkle of all spice and cinnamon to the apples after they were cut to sit while I prepared the rest of the batter and idk if it made a difference but I (accidentally) waited until the muffins were almost done to add the topping absolutely delicious and moist! They turned out perfect
263	29	The topping is the only good part about this recipe. Muffins came out super dry and very flavorless. Definitely need more moisture in the dough and Definitely need to add cinnamon or something to the batter.
264	30	I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top. It was supposed to be a dessert for after dinner, but the aroma filled our house and lured the whole family out to the kitchen. Guess I'll have to make another batch!
265	30	I could have used more apples, but they were very good. I will try them on ice cream.
337	7	You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good!
266	30	Alrighty then Baker-Bees and Chef-Aronis!Here's my 2¢...Definitely pleasanly pleased!Wasn't quite sure with the twists I made!First of all, had just three apples although in an 8x8 Pyrex it made 3 perfect layers. I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite!
267	30	DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch.
268	30	I would use less nutmeg
269	30	This recipe did not turn out well for me. I used some Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples. The whole thing was just over spiced and came out dry and mealy. I was so hoping it was going to turn out well but it did not. Oh well. I'll look for another baked apple recipe.
270	30	Looks & tastes great, smells fantastic!
271	30	It definitely needed more water or some type of liquid but the spots that weren't dried out were really tasty.
272	30	Apple pie, baked apples ECT have never really been a favorite of mine but i had an abundance of red apples that i needed to use up so i gave  this a try. Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too.
273	31	My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.
274	31	This was perfection!  I did add 1 T lime juice in addition to the lemon juice.  I have used grapes, raisins (my favorite), and chopped up dates (which adds a toffee-like flavor).  This is a winner and it's quick to put together.  Thank you, Penny.
275	31	Very good! I did not have lemon juice but still good! Some people use whipped cream in the recipe
276	31	Easy and delicious!! Add more lemon juice to the dressing 👍
277	31	6-2-22 used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1 cup of green grapes. Yummy.6-14-22 made without the grapes, still delish but better with the grapes.
278	31	Made it exactly as written and it was lovely and yummy.  Now I can play with it a little for different flavors or make it just like this again.
279	31	This is pretty much the same way I've made my Waldorf salad for years. This time I substituted apple cider for the lemon juice, and it was awesome. Will continue to do this when I have cider available.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Sometimes I add green grapes, too. Such a good salad in winter.
280	31	It was good!  I didn't add the raisins as the apples I used (SweeTango) are plenty sweet already and I had to substitute pecans for walnuts, but everyone liked it.
281	31	Excellent!
282	1	husband loved it !
283	1	Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner.
284	1	This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
285	1	Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning.
286	1	I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make
287	1	Didn't have much flavor to the "filling".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart.
288	2	I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It’s a keeper!
289	2	Go to recipe for all holidays!  I usually add cinnamon and nutmeg to sugar mixture.Pie dough excellent for all pies.Love it!
290	2	I was very hesitant at first after looking at the ingredients I did exactly as instructed and could not believe the taste! This pie is, hands down, the best apple pie I have ever made!! You won’t be disappointed. Have one in the over now, added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and left the top crust whole. Can’t wait to see how this one turns out. It will be wonderful I am sure!!
291	2	Excellent!  I followed the directions as written.  I let the pie cool for 45 minutes before slicing, and it was not runny at all; just perfect!  It's very rich for us so I will be making this as a holiday dessert item. But most likely for ALL holidays.  It's that good!
292	2	I've made this pie several times. Always a hit with the crowd.
293	2	I loved the recipe, I did add my own little touch by add a little bit of cinnamon in to the pastry (dough), and added extra cinnamon in to the pie, just because I love cinnamon so much😍😍😍
294	2	This is the best Apple pie I've ever tasted
295	2	Lori stop reinventing the recipe. am a chef and have made this pie for as long as I can remember and it has never disappointed. do not mix the apples with the sauce, a lot of water in apples
296	2	granny apples, pinch of nutmeg, egg wash, great pie
297	3	Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples
298	3	Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough.
299	3	Yum good easy
300	3	Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it!
8434	1066	Fantastic 😍 j
301	3	I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too.
302	3	Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again.
303	3	Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn’t made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again!
304	3	I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER!
305	3	Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much.
306	4	Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum!
307	4	It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water.
308	4	I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it’s in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought
309	4	I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe!
310	4	Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream!
311	4	Very very good as is.  Used glass dish.
312	4	the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!!
313	4	Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious.
314	4	Love it!
315	5	I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again.
316	5	I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better.
317	5	5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great!
318	5	Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect.
319	5	This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using.
320	5	no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half.
321	5	Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies
322	5	I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome
323	5	Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my "go to" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp.
324	6	I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!!
325	6	I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it.
326	6	Made it in a 9x13" pan (9" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe.
327	6	Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream.
328	6	I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!
329	6	easy to make and my friends all loved it!!
330	6	Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect.
331	6	My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-)))
332	6	Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious!
333	7	Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving.
334	7	Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!!
335	7	I don’t even like cider but this was AMAZING!!!
336	7	I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self.
928	11	I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don’t hold enough filling.
338	7	I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd
339	7	Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange
340	7	This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good!
341	7	I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.
342	8	Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect.
343	8	My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!!
344	8	Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples)
345	8	Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out.
346	8	Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.
347	8	Love, Love, Love!
348	8	I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.
349	8	Just used a little less sugar for the crumb topping.   I used dried cranberries which worked well.   Delicious!!!
350	8	Wonderful! This will be my go-to for crisps from now on!
351	9	I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS!
352	9	I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream!
353	9	I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they’re in the oven now and I can’t wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I’ve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G
354	9	Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm.
355	9	I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this "apple rings".
356	9	Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough
357	9	Smells amazing!!
358	9	Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn’t used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!!
359	9	Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty.
360	10	I varied the recipe slightly1/2 c+ 1 T butter1/2 c white sugar1/2 c brown sugar1 T Cinnamon1/2 T NutmegI used a little extra butter because one of my apples was quite a bit larger than the rest. By NO stretch of the imagination am I a cook, so if I can do it, literally anyone can!It turned out fantastic. I'll definitely make this again!
361	10	My family loves these.  I make 2 versions as my son is diabetic. For his I use Stevia and for the rest of the family I make the regular recipe
362	10	Great pair with pork tenderloin.  So yummy.
363	10	Im a mediocre cook and this was extremely simple amd turned out delicious and that was with not a thing changed THANK YOU
364	10	I think they mean teaspoons not tablespoons of cinnamon.  The way it is written makes it overpowering.
365	10	So I changed it a bit.1/2 cup of unsalted butter1/2 white sugar1/2 brown sugar1 1/2 tb. Cinnamon1/2 tb. Nutmeg4 Granny Smith applesIt’s amazing
366	10	This is absolutely amazing!! i did however make another batch with brown sugar and it was SO GOOD! im 100% making this again
367	10	Follow recipe not changes pretty good going to make pancakes tomorrow and use up the rest of it
368	10	Just added a little more cinnamon
369	11	These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.
370	11	These turnovers were amazingly delicious! So fluffy and not too sweet.  I added a little lime to the glaze and sprinkled some pecans. I’m definitely, making them again.
371	11	I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
372	11	Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples.
373	11	I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious!
374	11	These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious!
375	11	Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group.
376	11	I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don’t hold enough filling.
377	11	Easy to make and delicious when using Careme all butter puff frozen pastry.
378	12	Loved this recipe. So easy and my family all love it and say it's the best apple crisp ever. I  wouldn't change a thing. Perfect as is.
379	12	I love it, simple, quick and oh so good. will be making again and again.
380	12	Great recipe but I used brown sugar and less and CERTAINLY no need for salt.Add half oats as well as a change
381	12	This was delicious.  I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Plenty sweet.  Also, added one bag of instant oatmeal.  Yummy!
382	12	Loved it added more apples than suggested and added oats.
383	12	Easy apple crisp recipe which I was I was looking for.  I did add 3 cups of apples, rather than 2 1/2, but followed the remaining ingredients.  It turned out exactly as I hoped.  Very good recipe!
384	12	It was quick and delicious. I’m making it again this evening but adding more apples and reducing the sugar
385	12	Very good and simple. I added 1/2 cup sugar and t cinnamon to apples and 1/2 cup oatmeal to topping.
386	12	this is so easy and the best recipe yet! family loves it .
387	13	So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed .
388	13	I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my "appeal" factor.  ❤️❤️☺️
389	13	Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i’m sure less butter would do the trick
390	13	Carmel just slid off
391	13	Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again.
392	13	This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn’t have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe!
393	13	I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.
394	13	The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe.
395	13	Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have "helpers" in the kitchen, but I'm so happy!
396	14	I make it at leat once a month.  We love it!
397	14	fantastic. added extra curry
398	14	This is one the greatest soups I have ever tasted. Highly recommend, I will be making this often.
399	14	I made this recipe as is, and have made it over and over again.  It is simple, and flavorful, and I highly recommend it.  If you aren't into curry, or Indian spice flavor profiles then this probably isn't your thing.  Otherwise it is amazing!
400	14	this was perfect as written
401	14	Excellent! Turned out exactly as described. I doubled the curry powder based on other reviews, yum! PS, I had leftover roasted chicken breast so I cubed that and added the chicken the last few minutes.
402	14	Delicious! Used a Granny Smith apple might try a sweeter one next time. I brown the chicken pieces before adding to soup.
403	14	Powerfully good! Best soup I’ve ever made.Went by the recipe, but used cooked rotisserie chicken that I added the last 10 minutes of cooking.Wow!
404	14	I had never had Mulligatawny soup, but wanted to give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is a wonderful soup, I did forget the cream at the end, but I loved it anyway.  This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup!
405	15	Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish.
406	15	I have used this for years as written.  Just be careful not to turn the apples into apple sauce.
407	15	Absolutely delicious! Apples need longer than 6-7 minutes if more than one layer in the pan.
408	15	Very tasty!
409	15	Made these apples and the family loved them.  They said it was as good as Cracker Barrel’s Apples.
410	15	As is, this recipe is so good, it made my house smell wonderful!  But I was hoping for a bit more of an apple pie filling taste, so I added a touch more brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added maybe 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.  This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream.
411	15	My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you
412	15	FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I’ll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).
413	15	It was delicious!
414	16	I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider.
415	16	This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect!
416	16	Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps!
417	16	Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe!
418	16	Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity!
419	16	Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again.
420	16	Delicious.
421	16	I used Cloves instead of AllSpice because I just did not have any in the spice rack. Turned out tasty.
422	16	I just made this recipe, it turned out great, I like it. I’m used to having hot cider made from the packets so I was surprised when it didn’t take as sweet as that, but I really like it.
423	17	Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.
424	17	Love the recipe,  quick and easy.  Taste great. My only thing is I have so much liquid,  don't look like it will fill a pie shell. What should I do next time?
425	17	Fast and easy to make. The apple pie filling is so good I can eat it out of the jar. I will use this recipe from now on! I did not use food color or lemon juice.
426	17	I've been making this for years. Here's a tip. Divide sauce equally between 7 quart jars, then add sliced apples and push from top down until full. Much less messy.
427	17	Love it! I used clear gel instead of cornstarch , came out amazing!!
428	17	I've made lots of different apple pie fillings, but this was by far my favorite. It turned out beautiful and SO yummy! I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg, but followed everything else as written. I already can't wait to whip up another batch for gifts. Thanks!
429	17	I didn't pre-congeal the syrup as it became virtually impossible to get into the jar around the apples.  It will boil up in the jar as it cans anyway, so I am conducting an experiment.  I got 100# of Honey Crisps, so anything that makes this more efficient will be GREAT.
430	17	I love this recipe!  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers though, and my house smells like Autumn.
431	17	I liked the recipe. The filling is tasty. This also freezes quite good. I have had a jar that did not seal. Instead of reprocessing the jar, I put the filling in a quart freezer bag and froze it and it tasted the same as the stuff in the jars.
432	18	I was very unhappy with the outcome of this pie. It ended up extremely watery.
433	18	I did not make any changes. This is a definite keeper.
434	18	no changes it came out perfect
435	18	Followed the recipe.  Yummy!
436	18	added brown sugar and vanilla came out great!
437	18	Really simple to make, apples still crisp
438	18	Instead of using store bought crust I did make it at home but it still tasted delicious
439	18	No I have not made any changes. Except we used margirin. We love the recipe
440	18	Made  as printed YUMMY
441	19	Rock-solid recipe. Followed it closely, but also added crushed pecans and in the second one, a small box of raisins, too. Tossed in a shake of ground clove to the apple coating. I used Gala apples that were just a bit too soft for eating, IMO. Keebler shortbread crust.
442	19	This pie tasted great, however the crumb is soggy after the first day, so I probably won’t be making it again. I liked that the apples were sliced thinly so that they were cooked thru and softened, rather than just cutting the apple into 8ths. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to make the sauce thicker. That was a good idea.
501	25	I made regular sized muffins (12), and did not need all the topping. The amounts for the topping could have been cut in half. What I have left will be great tossed into pancake batter!! Yummy
699	17	Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.
443	19	This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.  I only had one crust so I just made a crumble in a 2nd pie dish.  Even so, there was enough crumble for both pies.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
444	19	The recipe turned out really great I prefer no nuts in mine it was really easy to make and it's absolutely beautiful.
445	19	Yummo!  Came out perfect the 1st time.
446	19	I did make this pie but was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the crumb part. The crumb didn't come out the same way that it has in my past.
447	19	It turned out okay but needed to cook way longer than 25 minutes and not a lot of topping
448	19	This turned out to be one of the best apple pies I’ve ever made!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!
449	19	Easy to make and delicious.
450	20	It's the easiest
451	20	I made 50 caramel apples for an event. I was able to find very fresh Honeycrisp apples that were also fairly small. I used 8 lbs of caramels and about 1/2 cup of milk (maybe a bit more). This was very easy (except for the time involved in unwrapping 8 lbs of caramels!). I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick. Definitely freeze the apples first and take the advice to dip the apples in boiling water before freezing to remove the wax. These were a big hit and several people said they were the best caramel apples they had ever eaten!
452	20	Best caramel apples we've ever made!  Followed the recipe and forgot to add the vanilla this time.  Still turned out great.
453	20	Very simple and fun to make.  I made the mistake of putting the apples in the freezer overnight then putting the caramel and toppings on the next day.  They were so soggy when we ate them.  Definitely going to be refrigerating them only 15 min beforehand.
454	20	Awesome. Extremely easy tastes great
455	20	Tips from reviews:
456	20	Worked great!
457	20	Even after refrigerating it for 10 minutes (as some other users suggested), it was still super gooey and the caramel layer was thin because it was so gooey. I won’t be making this recipe again..
458	20	sound  good
459	21	This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome. Will be making this for Easter dinner this year. Thank you.
460	21	We made several changes and swaps due to what was on hand and personal preference- 1 1/2c sugar, 4c frozen blueberries instead of apples, tablespoon of dried lavender instead of cinnamon, melted butter instead of oil. It was more like a cookie dough than cake batter and baked closer to an hour (guessing because blueberries are juicier than apples) but came out amazing
461	21	Absolutely delicious! Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!!
462	21	German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe—Use 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the “oily sloppy mess” issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don’t like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake—sprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time—I cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it’s always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn’t high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won’t burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it’ll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick “raw batter” on it, it’s done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone!
463	21	Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can’t go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease.
464	21	The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting.
465	21	I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples.
466	21	I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster. Although it was followed precisely, the „apple cake“ turned into a soggy mess, was far too sweet and left an oily residue on the plate. I would not do this cake again.
467	21	Very easy to make.  Baked well and tastes delicious!!!
468	22	Excellent.  Added one beaten egg to hold it together more. Doubled the stock (homemade) and doubled the butter. I'll chop the cranberries very small next time and reduce the amount. Used real herbs. Used pork sausage/less sodium.  Baked 40 min w foil. Uncover and bake another 20.
469	22	The best stuffing I have ever made for 9 years now. My Father in law requested to cook for him on Christmas as my gift. My family loves it ❤️
470	22	I have made this recipe for over 10 years now.  My entire family adores it!  And many people ask for the recipe.  I have made Gluten and Dairy free very easily.  I also don't stuff the turkey, I bake at 350 for 30-45 min.
471	22	Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I think it’s a great recipe and everyone  liked it.  It will be even better next time because I’ll improve on these mistakes I made.  I used two different densities of bread; one disintegrated and the other was a little dry.  I will not double it next time because for 15 guests with several other side dishes there was a lot left over.
4211	519	REALLY tart, but the family loved it.
472	22	I’ve been making this stuffing for over 20 years now, and it’s always been a huge hit w/everyone! This year I used 1/2 loaf“Dave’s whole wheat bread w/seeds”, along with the traditional 3/4 bag of sage and onion stuffing. [ I’m diabetic, and am trying to use mostly whole wheat bread ] I soaked my cranberries in fresh squeezed orange juice, to plump up, before adding them to my stuffing. (Yummy little pop of citrus!) I used Turkey stock, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the recipe. I also used 3 small Granny Smith apples chopped up. It tastes delicious & my husband can’t stop trying bites as he travels through the kitchen. LolI plan on stuffing my brined Turkey tomorrow, and cooking the rest in a pan lined with parchment paper (buttered) and will add a bit of Turkey stock if needed, as it cooks.Best recipe ever! :)Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
473	22	This is my go-to stuffing recipe and my family members have asked for the recipe. I had to double the broth though, 3/4 cup just isn't enough.
474	22	Everyone loves when I make this. Especially me.
475	22	I have been making this stuffing for years now. My family loves loves loves it!
476	22	This has been a favorite every year for at least a decade. I cannot imagine a family Thanksgiving without it. My children, who are now grown, are continuing the tradition with their own families. I have never had anyone not like it. In fact, it is the first dish to run out.
477	23	I made the dough and the apple filling. Didn't change anything. Well, I halved the filling recipe because I was short an apple, but it was delicious.
478	23	This recipes is great. I added a touch of flour to the cinnamon in the last step for a little thickener.
479	23	I made them exactly as the recipe stated. But the crust split open while baking. Not sure why but it still tasted great.
480	23	I quadrupled the recipe to make  16 hand pies.   The apple cooked good and tasted great but I had to remove 1-1/2 cups of liquid from the frying pan because it was very watery.
481	23	Beautiful and delicious! I did follow some reviews and halved the white sugar. My family does not like extra sweet. I also added some lemon juice to the apples, a little cinnamon, and some vanilla. I used homemade pie dough and my handy dandy new mini pie press. Lovely result!
482	23	wonderful pies.  I added about 2 tsp more cinnamon, and only used brown sugar in the apple mixture.
483	23	Made this today.  Took longer to cook down the apples than expected but eventually they got to the right consistency. Dough took me awhile to properly roll out because I’m very inexperienced and used very chilled dough. Didn’t help I made a double batch. In spite of my ineptitude they came out GREAT!  If a doufus like me can have a success with this recipe then it’s a solid keeper.
484	23	I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times, and it inspired me to try different flavors. My favorite is to spread each pastry round with a little mango chutney, then I mix together 1 cup chopped fresh spinach with 1 cup diced paneer and season with curry powder for the filling.
485	23	I tried these and loved them! Another time, I made these as a dinner pie switching the apples for chopped ham and broccoli, and instead of cinnamon and sugar I used some Dijon mustard. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top before baking. They were a big hit!
486	24	I halfed the recipe because i didn't have that many apples. I also forgot to add the apple cider vinegar. But still came out yummy.
487	24	This is my go to canning recipe for apple butter
488	24	This turned out amazing.  I had a lot of apples that I needed to use so I made a double batch and I had two crockpots going. Both cooked at different temperatures so I had to make adjustments, but I had to cook on low for both of them.  I ran out of cloves so I only used a pinch of cloves but some family members don't care for cloves. I thought the allspice had enough clove in it to make sufficient without the cloves. Will be keeping this recipe and making it again.
489	24	I did not make as much as the recipe called for and appreciated the ability to change the amount through allrecipes.
490	24	Just finished canning this apple butter and it truly is amazing. So easy and the texture is perfect. Let it simmer overnight in my slow cooker. It did not scorch and by mid-morning it was ready to can. Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Love that it is so low in refined sugar compared to other recipes.
491	24	Actually made as directed, lil heavy handed on spices. Took lot longer in crock pot, to cook down than I expected, might try stove top next time, but Abble Butter was so Amazing, family raved.! But I would likecto Thank mostly for eady, step by step canning instructions,!!  It was my first, tryed other sites. But for me yours was so easy to understand. Turned out great, going to make more for gifts.
492	24	I made about 20 small jars of this apple butter and 10 fresh loaves of bread cut lengthwise to give me 2 loaves out of each. These were then given as Christmas gifts to all my family. They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy
493	24	Turned out great will make again
494	24	I am making it again now! This time I have added some pears as I needed to use them before they spoiled. Smells and tastes great!
495	25	Added 2 tbsp of sour cream, and used half brown and half white sugar.Made 12 delicious muffins
496	25	We loved these muffins. Shared them with my neighbor who loved them too. The recipe makes 12 normal size muffins. Does anyone know if they freeze well?
497	25	My family loves these muffins, but like many I too adjusted the recipe to my family's taste.  I am not a measuring kind of gal, but here is what I did. I split the sugar to about 1/3 white and 1/3 brown, added about a tsp of vanilla and a shake of nutmeg. I used 3 small gala apples cut into small chunks.  The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.  I cooked them a bit longer than the recipe recommended and then eyeballed them and checked the middle before removing them from the oven.  I would say they were in about 30 minutes.  They came out great!
498	25	These turned out amazing! I made mine gluten free with brown rice and 1/4 almond flour.  Used a little less butter for topping but melted it to mix easier. My husband said they taste like mini apple pies
499	25	Like a different review said, DON'T fill to top it will overflow. Also make sure the butter for the topping is room temp. Otherwise it doesn't turn out like a crumbly topping and it spills over.
500	25	Too much of butter topping, and 400 might be a bit too hot
929	11	Easy to make and delicious when using Careme all butter puff frozen pastry.
502	25	I baked these this morning and they were great! I did some modifications as I’ve read some suggestions on the reviews - not filling it up to the brim, instead of white sugar, half of it was brown sugar, butter for topping was reduced to 1/4 cup! Turned out really well! Thank you for this recipe.
503	25	Good but followed the suggestions on the prior reviews.
504	26	This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.  I'm not sure why my 2 granny smith apples made 4 cups of chopped apples instead of the 2 cups the recipe called for, but I used all 4 cups.   I will definetly cut back to 2 cups.  It was a great bread anyway, just too many apples. I  had so much batter I made 6 muffins to be sure I had enough room in the bread pan.  This makes great muffins also!
505	26	I like the apple bread. I like baking it.
506	26	The bread did not raise - couldn't eat. I followed directions and put in the correct baking powder.
507	26	I read this recipe and it seemed just what I was looking for.  I had frozen apples I needed to use up.  I read the other reviews and I used a tip from one of the other reviews and used half light brown sugar and the other half the white sugar.  I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.  It is delicious and I am keeping this recipe as my go to apple bread recipe from now on. It did stick in my greased pan so next time I will either grease and flour or use parchment paper.  Thank you so much for this delicious treat.
508	26	I had to cook this bread for 30 minutes more than the recipe called for. And, when I tasted it, it was way too sweet. I think only one cup of sugar is more appropriate rather than two.
509	26	1/31/2023  I see by the earlier review I first made this bread in 2017!  Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in!
510	26	I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it.
511	26	Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.
512	26	This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe!
513	27	I didn’t think they had muchflavor . They puffed up a lot and weredark on outside and doughy inside.
514	27	Did not like this. I made as recipe called for. Dead apple fritters. No flavor. How do i remove this recipe. I would not make again. If i did i sure would add cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, more sugar.
515	27	This is exactly the same as my grandma's recipe that we made as kids. Yum! We would sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar or dip them in syrup.
516	27	This is a great and simple recipe!! My 5th time making it.  I made a few adjustments by adding 1/4c  of sugar, 4c of apples, 1tsp of vanilla, a bit more milk, and reducing the amt. of baking powder.  I also added 2 tbs. of melted butter instead of oil.  Next time I'll try adding a bit of almond extract.
517	27	I added a couple of splashes of milk in order to fully incorporate the dry ingredients.  I also added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg, and cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I'm super pleased with this recipe. The fritters were light and creamy. Definitely adding this to my recipes.
518	27	you will not find taste like this at your local store! these apple fritters are soft moist and fluffy, full of flavor, free of preservatives and must be eaten within a couple of days, best if consumed immediately after being prepared!
519	27	I added 1/2 T sugar, plus cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves; good that way and no glaze or cinnamon sugar was needed.
520	27	Almost exactly the same as my mom's recipe!  She always served with sausage patties, and we ate them with syrup. My daughters always  loved them for supper whenever their dad had to go out of town!
521	27	I disliked how crunchy the apples still were.
522	28	Use yellow cake mix  about a cup and half  instead of flour mix with butter and crumble ...a game changer.
523	28	Did not like the crumb topping.  Tasteless.  Is 1/4 cup brown sugar in recipe a typo?  Always disappointed when I try a new recipe and turns out it was just not worth the work.
524	28	I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The crumble on top reminded me of pie crust, and I thought it  tasted really good.
525	28	Pretty tasty. I added a little extra brown sugar. A tip for the butter. I freeze it and used a cheese grater to help cut it into the flour mixture. I also turned the broiler on to brown the top.
526	28	The topping is doughy. Not crispy at all.
527	28	I used apple pie filling that was sweetened with sucralose and Truvia brown sugar to make this a lower calorie dessert. No one even noticed.
528	28	It was literally ok, nothing more. Topping never crisped, took it out after 35 minutes. Topping just tastes like flour mostly with a little sugar. I’m the only one in my household that will eat it, no complaint there. Not the best but not the worst.
529	28	It took a good 30 minutes before it looked done. It sure did taste good though!
593	5	5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great!
530	28	I used the suggestions to use oats and reduce the flour. 1 cup seemed like a lot of butter bit I gave it a fo anyway. t was so greasy!! The butter was pooling at the edges. I'm not a pro baker but I bake offen enough and have made apple crisp before but couldnt find the recipe I'd used previously so I tried this. Threw it in the garbage.
531	29	They forgot the liquid in the batter. I modified it by adding apple sauce and apple juice, plus I added cinnamon to the batter. They should remove or modify this recipe.
532	29	Needed to make something quick with my aging apples. It was simple, had all the ingredients I needed. But I did add cinnamon and allspice to my dry mix and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the wet. I debated cooking down the apples a bit before, but no need to.
533	29	Like other reviews, I have to add a bunch of milk to thin the batter out. I pour and mix until the creator tells me to stop! I add cinnamon to the flour mixture for an extra kick
534	29	I have made these twice, once with white flour and once with whole wheat flour, I use frozen sliced apples and they turned out great, will be my favorite go-to recipie.
535	29	These came out amazing! I followed the recipe- and several tips mentioned in reviews. Added cinnamon, allspice, and a splash of milk (oat milk) to the batter. Also seared the apple slices in butter before adding them which made them easier to mix into the batter. Everyone in the family loved them and we’re still snacking on them two days later.
536	29	These came out pretty good! I chopped granny smith apples into small pieces and let them sit in the sugar before adding to the mix, added all spice, and a splash of milk. They turned out delicious and were not dry!
537	29	These were quite tasty and easy to make.  Only took about 1.5 apples, I did not bother peeling and that worked out just fine.  I doubled the cinnamon in the topping to 1/4 tsp but next time I think I will also increase cinnamon in the topping and add cinnamon to the batter itself.  I think the recipe is a keeper but with more cinnamon.
538	29	Amazing … I did add milk to make the batter more liquidity, And added a sprinkle of all spice and cinnamon to the apples after they were cut to sit while I prepared the rest of the batter and idk if it made a difference but I (accidentally) waited until the muffins were almost done to add the topping absolutely delicious and moist! They turned out perfect
539	29	The topping is the only good part about this recipe. Muffins came out super dry and very flavorless. Definitely need more moisture in the dough and Definitely need to add cinnamon or something to the batter.
540	30	I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top. It was supposed to be a dessert for after dinner, but the aroma filled our house and lured the whole family out to the kitchen. Guess I'll have to make another batch!
541	30	I could have used more apples, but they were very good. I will try them on ice cream.
542	30	Alrighty then Baker-Bees and Chef-Aronis!Here's my 2¢...Definitely pleasanly pleased!Wasn't quite sure with the twists I made!First of all, had just three apples although in an 8x8 Pyrex it made 3 perfect layers. I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite!
543	30	DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch.
544	30	I would use less nutmeg
545	30	This recipe did not turn out well for me. I used some Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples. The whole thing was just over spiced and came out dry and mealy. I was so hoping it was going to turn out well but it did not. Oh well. I'll look for another baked apple recipe.
546	30	Looks & tastes great, smells fantastic!
547	30	It definitely needed more water or some type of liquid but the spots that weren't dried out were really tasty.
548	30	Apple pie, baked apples ECT have never really been a favorite of mine but i had an abundance of red apples that i needed to use up so i gave  this a try. Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too.
549	31	My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.
550	31	This was perfection!  I did add 1 T lime juice in addition to the lemon juice.  I have used grapes, raisins (my favorite), and chopped up dates (which adds a toffee-like flavor).  This is a winner and it's quick to put together.  Thank you, Penny.
551	31	Very good! I did not have lemon juice but still good! Some people use whipped cream in the recipe
552	31	Easy and delicious!! Add more lemon juice to the dressing 👍
553	31	6-2-22 used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1 cup of green grapes. Yummy.6-14-22 made without the grapes, still delish but better with the grapes.
554	31	Made it exactly as written and it was lovely and yummy.  Now I can play with it a little for different flavors or make it just like this again.
555	31	This is pretty much the same way I've made my Waldorf salad for years. This time I substituted apple cider for the lemon juice, and it was awesome. Will continue to do this when I have cider available.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Sometimes I add green grapes, too. Such a good salad in winter.
556	31	It was good!  I didn't add the raisins as the apples I used (SweeTango) are plenty sweet already and I had to substitute pecans for walnuts, but everyone liked it.
557	31	Excellent!
558	1	husband loved it !
559	1	Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner.
560	1	This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
561	1	Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning.
562	1	I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make
563	1	Didn't have much flavor to the "filling".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart.
564	2	I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It’s a keeper!
565	2	Go to recipe for all holidays!  I usually add cinnamon and nutmeg to sugar mixture.Pie dough excellent for all pies.Love it!
566	2	I was very hesitant at first after looking at the ingredients I did exactly as instructed and could not believe the taste! This pie is, hands down, the best apple pie I have ever made!! You won’t be disappointed. Have one in the over now, added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and left the top crust whole. Can’t wait to see how this one turns out. It will be wonderful I am sure!!
567	2	Excellent!  I followed the directions as written.  I let the pie cool for 45 minutes before slicing, and it was not runny at all; just perfect!  It's very rich for us so I will be making this as a holiday dessert item. But most likely for ALL holidays.  It's that good!
568	2	I've made this pie several times. Always a hit with the crowd.
569	2	I loved the recipe, I did add my own little touch by add a little bit of cinnamon in to the pastry (dough), and added extra cinnamon in to the pie, just because I love cinnamon so much😍😍😍
570	2	This is the best Apple pie I've ever tasted
571	2	Lori stop reinventing the recipe. am a chef and have made this pie for as long as I can remember and it has never disappointed. do not mix the apples with the sauce, a lot of water in apples
572	2	granny apples, pinch of nutmeg, egg wash, great pie
573	3	Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples
574	3	Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough.
575	3	Yum good easy
576	3	Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it!
577	3	I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too.
578	3	Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again.
579	3	Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn’t made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again!
580	3	I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER!
581	3	Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much.
582	4	Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum!
583	4	It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water.
584	4	I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it’s in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought
585	4	I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe!
586	4	Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream!
587	4	Very very good as is.  Used glass dish.
588	4	the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!!
589	4	Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious.
590	4	Love it!
591	5	I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again.
592	5	I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better.
594	5	Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect.
595	5	This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using.
596	5	no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half.
597	5	Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies
598	5	I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome
599	5	Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my "go to" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp.
600	6	I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!!
601	6	I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it.
602	6	Made it in a 9x13" pan (9" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe.
603	6	Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream.
604	6	I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!
605	6	easy to make and my friends all loved it!!
606	6	Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect.
607	6	My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-)))
608	6	Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious!
609	7	Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving.
610	7	Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!!
611	7	I don’t even like cider but this was AMAZING!!!
612	7	I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self.
613	7	You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good!
614	7	I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd
615	7	Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange
616	7	This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good!
617	7	I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.
618	8	Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect.
619	8	My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!!
620	8	Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples)
621	8	Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out.
622	8	Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.
623	8	Love, Love, Love!
624	8	I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.
625	8	Just used a little less sugar for the crumb topping.   I used dried cranberries which worked well.   Delicious!!!
626	8	Wonderful! This will be my go-to for crisps from now on!
627	9	I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS!
628	9	I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream!
629	9	I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they’re in the oven now and I can’t wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I’ve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G
630	9	Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm.
631	9	I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this "apple rings".
632	9	Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough
633	9	Smells amazing!!
634	9	Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn’t used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!!
636	10	I varied the recipe slightly1/2 c+ 1 T butter1/2 c white sugar1/2 c brown sugar1 T Cinnamon1/2 T NutmegI used a little extra butter because one of my apples was quite a bit larger than the rest. By NO stretch of the imagination am I a cook, so if I can do it, literally anyone can!It turned out fantastic. I'll definitely make this again!
637	10	My family loves these.  I make 2 versions as my son is diabetic. For his I use Stevia and for the rest of the family I make the regular recipe
638	10	Great pair with pork tenderloin.  So yummy.
639	10	Im a mediocre cook and this was extremely simple amd turned out delicious and that was with not a thing changed THANK YOU
640	10	I think they mean teaspoons not tablespoons of cinnamon.  The way it is written makes it overpowering.
641	10	So I changed it a bit.1/2 cup of unsalted butter1/2 white sugar1/2 brown sugar1 1/2 tb. Cinnamon1/2 tb. Nutmeg4 Granny Smith applesIt’s amazing
642	10	This is absolutely amazing!! i did however make another batch with brown sugar and it was SO GOOD! im 100% making this again
643	10	Follow recipe not changes pretty good going to make pancakes tomorrow and use up the rest of it
644	10	Just added a little more cinnamon
645	11	These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.
646	11	These turnovers were amazingly delicious! So fluffy and not too sweet.  I added a little lime to the glaze and sprinkled some pecans. I’m definitely, making them again.
647	11	I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
648	11	Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples.
649	11	I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious!
650	11	These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious!
651	11	Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group.
652	11	I made it simple - I used cherry pie filling.  My only complaint is that the squares don’t hold enough filling.
653	11	Easy to make and delicious when using Careme all butter puff frozen pastry.
654	12	Loved this recipe. So easy and my family all love it and say it's the best apple crisp ever. I  wouldn't change a thing. Perfect as is.
655	12	I love it, simple, quick and oh so good. will be making again and again.
656	12	Great recipe but I used brown sugar and less and CERTAINLY no need for salt.Add half oats as well as a change
657	12	This was delicious.  I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Plenty sweet.  Also, added one bag of instant oatmeal.  Yummy!
658	12	Loved it added more apples than suggested and added oats.
659	12	Easy apple crisp recipe which I was I was looking for.  I did add 3 cups of apples, rather than 2 1/2, but followed the remaining ingredients.  It turned out exactly as I hoped.  Very good recipe!
660	12	It was quick and delicious. I’m making it again this evening but adding more apples and reducing the sugar
661	12	Very good and simple. I added 1/2 cup sugar and t cinnamon to apples and 1/2 cup oatmeal to topping.
662	12	this is so easy and the best recipe yet! family loves it .
663	13	So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed .
664	13	I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my "appeal" factor.  ❤️❤️☺️
665	13	Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i’m sure less butter would do the trick
666	13	Carmel just slid off
667	13	Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again.
668	13	This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn’t have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe!
931	12	I love it, simple, quick and oh so good. will be making again and again.
669	13	I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.
670	13	The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe.
671	13	Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have "helpers" in the kitchen, but I'm so happy!
672	14	I make it at leat once a month.  We love it!
673	14	fantastic. added extra curry
674	14	This is one the greatest soups I have ever tasted. Highly recommend, I will be making this often.
675	14	I made this recipe as is, and have made it over and over again.  It is simple, and flavorful, and I highly recommend it.  If you aren't into curry, or Indian spice flavor profiles then this probably isn't your thing.  Otherwise it is amazing!
676	14	this was perfect as written
677	14	Excellent! Turned out exactly as described. I doubled the curry powder based on other reviews, yum! PS, I had leftover roasted chicken breast so I cubed that and added the chicken the last few minutes.
678	14	Delicious! Used a Granny Smith apple might try a sweeter one next time. I brown the chicken pieces before adding to soup.
679	14	Powerfully good! Best soup I’ve ever made.Went by the recipe, but used cooked rotisserie chicken that I added the last 10 minutes of cooking.Wow!
680	14	I had never had Mulligatawny soup, but wanted to give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is a wonderful soup, I did forget the cream at the end, but I loved it anyway.  This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup!
681	15	Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish.
682	15	I have used this for years as written.  Just be careful not to turn the apples into apple sauce.
683	15	Absolutely delicious! Apples need longer than 6-7 minutes if more than one layer in the pan.
684	15	Very tasty!
685	15	Made these apples and the family loved them.  They said it was as good as Cracker Barrel’s Apples.
686	15	As is, this recipe is so good, it made my house smell wonderful!  But I was hoping for a bit more of an apple pie filling taste, so I added a touch more brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added maybe 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.  This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream.
687	15	My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you
688	15	FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I’ll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).
689	15	It was delicious!
690	16	I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider.
691	16	This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect!
692	16	Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps!
693	16	Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe!
694	16	Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity!
695	16	Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again.
696	16	Delicious.
697	16	I used Cloves instead of AllSpice because I just did not have any in the spice rack. Turned out tasty.
698	16	I just made this recipe, it turned out great, I like it. I’m used to having hot cider made from the packets so I was surprised when it didn’t take as sweet as that, but I really like it.
700	17	Love the recipe,  quick and easy.  Taste great. My only thing is I have so much liquid,  don't look like it will fill a pie shell. What should I do next time?
701	17	Fast and easy to make. The apple pie filling is so good I can eat it out of the jar. I will use this recipe from now on! I did not use food color or lemon juice.
702	17	I've been making this for years. Here's a tip. Divide sauce equally between 7 quart jars, then add sliced apples and push from top down until full. Much less messy.
703	17	Love it! I used clear gel instead of cornstarch , came out amazing!!
704	17	I've made lots of different apple pie fillings, but this was by far my favorite. It turned out beautiful and SO yummy! I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg, but followed everything else as written. I already can't wait to whip up another batch for gifts. Thanks!
705	17	I didn't pre-congeal the syrup as it became virtually impossible to get into the jar around the apples.  It will boil up in the jar as it cans anyway, so I am conducting an experiment.  I got 100# of Honey Crisps, so anything that makes this more efficient will be GREAT.
706	17	I love this recipe!  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers though, and my house smells like Autumn.
707	17	I liked the recipe. The filling is tasty. This also freezes quite good. I have had a jar that did not seal. Instead of reprocessing the jar, I put the filling in a quart freezer bag and froze it and it tasted the same as the stuff in the jars.
708	18	I was very unhappy with the outcome of this pie. It ended up extremely watery.
709	18	I did not make any changes. This is a definite keeper.
710	18	no changes it came out perfect
711	18	Followed the recipe.  Yummy!
712	18	added brown sugar and vanilla came out great!
713	18	Really simple to make, apples still crisp
714	18	Instead of using store bought crust I did make it at home but it still tasted delicious
715	18	No I have not made any changes. Except we used margirin. We love the recipe
716	18	Made  as printed YUMMY
717	19	Rock-solid recipe. Followed it closely, but also added crushed pecans and in the second one, a small box of raisins, too. Tossed in a shake of ground clove to the apple coating. I used Gala apples that were just a bit too soft for eating, IMO. Keebler shortbread crust.
718	19	This pie tasted great, however the crumb is soggy after the first day, so I probably won’t be making it again. I liked that the apples were sliced thinly so that they were cooked thru and softened, rather than just cutting the apple into 8ths. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to make the sauce thicker. That was a good idea.
719	19	This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.  I only had one crust so I just made a crumble in a 2nd pie dish.  Even so, there was enough crumble for both pies.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
720	19	The recipe turned out really great I prefer no nuts in mine it was really easy to make and it's absolutely beautiful.
721	19	Yummo!  Came out perfect the 1st time.
722	19	I did make this pie but was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the crumb part. The crumb didn't come out the same way that it has in my past.
723	19	It turned out okay but needed to cook way longer than 25 minutes and not a lot of topping
724	19	This turned out to be one of the best apple pies I’ve ever made!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!
725	19	Easy to make and delicious.
726	20	It's the easiest
727	20	I made 50 caramel apples for an event. I was able to find very fresh Honeycrisp apples that were also fairly small. I used 8 lbs of caramels and about 1/2 cup of milk (maybe a bit more). This was very easy (except for the time involved in unwrapping 8 lbs of caramels!). I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick. Definitely freeze the apples first and take the advice to dip the apples in boiling water before freezing to remove the wax. These were a big hit and several people said they were the best caramel apples they had ever eaten!
728	20	Best caramel apples we've ever made!  Followed the recipe and forgot to add the vanilla this time.  Still turned out great.
729	20	Very simple and fun to make.  I made the mistake of putting the apples in the freezer overnight then putting the caramel and toppings on the next day.  They were so soggy when we ate them.  Definitely going to be refrigerating them only 15 min beforehand.
730	20	Awesome. Extremely easy tastes great
731	20	Tips from reviews:
732	20	Worked great!
733	20	Even after refrigerating it for 10 minutes (as some other users suggested), it was still super gooey and the caramel layer was thin because it was so gooey. I won’t be making this recipe again..
734	20	sound  good
735	21	This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome. Will be making this for Easter dinner this year. Thank you.
736	21	We made several changes and swaps due to what was on hand and personal preference- 1 1/2c sugar, 4c frozen blueberries instead of apples, tablespoon of dried lavender instead of cinnamon, melted butter instead of oil. It was more like a cookie dough than cake batter and baked closer to an hour (guessing because blueberries are juicier than apples) but came out amazing
737	21	Absolutely delicious! Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!!
762	24	I halfed the recipe because i didn't have that many apples. I also forgot to add the apple cider vinegar. But still came out yummy.
763	24	This is my go to canning recipe for apple butter
764	24	This turned out amazing.  I had a lot of apples that I needed to use so I made a double batch and I had two crockpots going. Both cooked at different temperatures so I had to make adjustments, but I had to cook on low for both of them.  I ran out of cloves so I only used a pinch of cloves but some family members don't care for cloves. I thought the allspice had enough clove in it to make sufficient without the cloves. Will be keeping this recipe and making it again.
765	24	I did not make as much as the recipe called for and appreciated the ability to change the amount through allrecipes.
965	15	It was delicious!
738	21	German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe—Use 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the “oily sloppy mess” issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don’t like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake—sprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time—I cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it’s always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn’t high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won’t burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it’ll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick “raw batter” on it, it’s done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone!
739	21	Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can’t go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease.
740	21	The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting.
741	21	I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples.
742	21	I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster. Although it was followed precisely, the „apple cake“ turned into a soggy mess, was far too sweet and left an oily residue on the plate. I would not do this cake again.
743	21	Very easy to make.  Baked well and tastes delicious!!!
744	22	Excellent.  Added one beaten egg to hold it together more. Doubled the stock (homemade) and doubled the butter. I'll chop the cranberries very small next time and reduce the amount. Used real herbs. Used pork sausage/less sodium.  Baked 40 min w foil. Uncover and bake another 20.
745	22	The best stuffing I have ever made for 9 years now. My Father in law requested to cook for him on Christmas as my gift. My family loves it ❤️
746	22	I have made this recipe for over 10 years now.  My entire family adores it!  And many people ask for the recipe.  I have made Gluten and Dairy free very easily.  I also don't stuff the turkey, I bake at 350 for 30-45 min.
747	22	Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I think it’s a great recipe and everyone  liked it.  It will be even better next time because I’ll improve on these mistakes I made.  I used two different densities of bread; one disintegrated and the other was a little dry.  I will not double it next time because for 15 guests with several other side dishes there was a lot left over.
748	22	I’ve been making this stuffing for over 20 years now, and it’s always been a huge hit w/everyone! This year I used 1/2 loaf“Dave’s whole wheat bread w/seeds”, along with the traditional 3/4 bag of sage and onion stuffing. [ I’m diabetic, and am trying to use mostly whole wheat bread ] I soaked my cranberries in fresh squeezed orange juice, to plump up, before adding them to my stuffing. (Yummy little pop of citrus!) I used Turkey stock, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the recipe. I also used 3 small Granny Smith apples chopped up. It tastes delicious & my husband can’t stop trying bites as he travels through the kitchen. LolI plan on stuffing my brined Turkey tomorrow, and cooking the rest in a pan lined with parchment paper (buttered) and will add a bit of Turkey stock if needed, as it cooks.Best recipe ever! :)Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
749	22	This is my go-to stuffing recipe and my family members have asked for the recipe. I had to double the broth though, 3/4 cup just isn't enough.
750	22	Everyone loves when I make this. Especially me.
751	22	I have been making this stuffing for years now. My family loves loves loves it!
752	22	This has been a favorite every year for at least a decade. I cannot imagine a family Thanksgiving without it. My children, who are now grown, are continuing the tradition with their own families. I have never had anyone not like it. In fact, it is the first dish to run out.
753	23	I made the dough and the apple filling. Didn't change anything. Well, I halved the filling recipe because I was short an apple, but it was delicious.
754	23	This recipes is great. I added a touch of flour to the cinnamon in the last step for a little thickener.
755	23	I made them exactly as the recipe stated. But the crust split open while baking. Not sure why but it still tasted great.
756	23	I quadrupled the recipe to make  16 hand pies.   The apple cooked good and tasted great but I had to remove 1-1/2 cups of liquid from the frying pan because it was very watery.
757	23	Beautiful and delicious! I did follow some reviews and halved the white sugar. My family does not like extra sweet. I also added some lemon juice to the apples, a little cinnamon, and some vanilla. I used homemade pie dough and my handy dandy new mini pie press. Lovely result!
758	23	wonderful pies.  I added about 2 tsp more cinnamon, and only used brown sugar in the apple mixture.
759	23	Made this today.  Took longer to cook down the apples than expected but eventually they got to the right consistency. Dough took me awhile to properly roll out because I’m very inexperienced and used very chilled dough. Didn’t help I made a double batch. In spite of my ineptitude they came out GREAT!  If a doufus like me can have a success with this recipe then it’s a solid keeper.
760	23	I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times, and it inspired me to try different flavors. My favorite is to spread each pastry round with a little mango chutney, then I mix together 1 cup chopped fresh spinach with 1 cup diced paneer and season with curry powder for the filling.
761	23	I tried these and loved them! Another time, I made these as a dinner pie switching the apples for chopped ham and broccoli, and instead of cinnamon and sugar I used some Dijon mustard. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top before baking. They were a big hit!
766	24	Just finished canning this apple butter and it truly is amazing. So easy and the texture is perfect. Let it simmer overnight in my slow cooker. It did not scorch and by mid-morning it was ready to can. Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Love that it is so low in refined sugar compared to other recipes.
767	24	Actually made as directed, lil heavy handed on spices. Took lot longer in crock pot, to cook down than I expected, might try stove top next time, but Abble Butter was so Amazing, family raved.! But I would likecto Thank mostly for eady, step by step canning instructions,!!  It was my first, tryed other sites. But for me yours was so easy to understand. Turned out great, going to make more for gifts.
768	24	I made about 20 small jars of this apple butter and 10 fresh loaves of bread cut lengthwise to give me 2 loaves out of each. These were then given as Christmas gifts to all my family. They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy
769	24	Turned out great will make again
770	24	I am making it again now! This time I have added some pears as I needed to use them before they spoiled. Smells and tastes great!
771	25	Added 2 tbsp of sour cream, and used half brown and half white sugar.Made 12 delicious muffins
772	25	We loved these muffins. Shared them with my neighbor who loved them too. The recipe makes 12 normal size muffins. Does anyone know if they freeze well?
773	25	My family loves these muffins, but like many I too adjusted the recipe to my family's taste.  I am not a measuring kind of gal, but here is what I did. I split the sugar to about 1/3 white and 1/3 brown, added about a tsp of vanilla and a shake of nutmeg. I used 3 small gala apples cut into small chunks.  The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.  I cooked them a bit longer than the recipe recommended and then eyeballed them and checked the middle before removing them from the oven.  I would say they were in about 30 minutes.  They came out great!
774	25	These turned out amazing! I made mine gluten free with brown rice and 1/4 almond flour.  Used a little less butter for topping but melted it to mix easier. My husband said they taste like mini apple pies
775	25	Like a different review said, DON'T fill to top it will overflow. Also make sure the butter for the topping is room temp. Otherwise it doesn't turn out like a crumbly topping and it spills over.
776	25	Too much of butter topping, and 400 might be a bit too hot
777	25	I made regular sized muffins (12), and did not need all the topping. The amounts for the topping could have been cut in half. What I have left will be great tossed into pancake batter!! Yummy
778	25	I baked these this morning and they were great! I did some modifications as I’ve read some suggestions on the reviews - not filling it up to the brim, instead of white sugar, half of it was brown sugar, butter for topping was reduced to 1/4 cup! Turned out really well! Thank you for this recipe.
779	25	Good but followed the suggestions on the prior reviews.
780	26	This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.  I'm not sure why my 2 granny smith apples made 4 cups of chopped apples instead of the 2 cups the recipe called for, but I used all 4 cups.   I will definetly cut back to 2 cups.  It was a great bread anyway, just too many apples. I  had so much batter I made 6 muffins to be sure I had enough room in the bread pan.  This makes great muffins also!
781	26	I like the apple bread. I like baking it.
782	26	The bread did not raise - couldn't eat. I followed directions and put in the correct baking powder.
783	26	I read this recipe and it seemed just what I was looking for.  I had frozen apples I needed to use up.  I read the other reviews and I used a tip from one of the other reviews and used half light brown sugar and the other half the white sugar.  I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.  It is delicious and I am keeping this recipe as my go to apple bread recipe from now on. It did stick in my greased pan so next time I will either grease and flour or use parchment paper.  Thank you so much for this delicious treat.
784	26	I had to cook this bread for 30 minutes more than the recipe called for. And, when I tasted it, it was way too sweet. I think only one cup of sugar is more appropriate rather than two.
785	26	1/31/2023  I see by the earlier review I first made this bread in 2017!  Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in!
786	26	I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it.
787	26	Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.
788	26	This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe!
789	27	I didn’t think they had muchflavor . They puffed up a lot and weredark on outside and doughy inside.
4968	628	This is an amazing shake highly recommended
790	27	Did not like this. I made as recipe called for. Dead apple fritters. No flavor. How do i remove this recipe. I would not make again. If i did i sure would add cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, more sugar.
791	27	This is exactly the same as my grandma's recipe that we made as kids. Yum! We would sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar or dip them in syrup.
792	27	This is a great and simple recipe!! My 5th time making it.  I made a few adjustments by adding 1/4c  of sugar, 4c of apples, 1tsp of vanilla, a bit more milk, and reducing the amt. of baking powder.  I also added 2 tbs. of melted butter instead of oil.  Next time I'll try adding a bit of almond extract.
793	27	I added a couple of splashes of milk in order to fully incorporate the dry ingredients.  I also added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg, and cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I'm super pleased with this recipe. The fritters were light and creamy. Definitely adding this to my recipes.
794	27	you will not find taste like this at your local store! these apple fritters are soft moist and fluffy, full of flavor, free of preservatives and must be eaten within a couple of days, best if consumed immediately after being prepared!
795	27	I added 1/2 T sugar, plus cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves; good that way and no glaze or cinnamon sugar was needed.
796	27	Almost exactly the same as my mom's recipe!  She always served with sausage patties, and we ate them with syrup. My daughters always  loved them for supper whenever their dad had to go out of town!
797	27	I disliked how crunchy the apples still were.
798	28	Use yellow cake mix  about a cup and half  instead of flour mix with butter and crumble ...a game changer.
799	28	Did not like the crumb topping.  Tasteless.  Is 1/4 cup brown sugar in recipe a typo?  Always disappointed when I try a new recipe and turns out it was just not worth the work.
800	28	I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The crumble on top reminded me of pie crust, and I thought it  tasted really good.
801	28	Pretty tasty. I added a little extra brown sugar. A tip for the butter. I freeze it and used a cheese grater to help cut it into the flour mixture. I also turned the broiler on to brown the top.
802	28	The topping is doughy. Not crispy at all.
803	28	I used apple pie filling that was sweetened with sucralose and Truvia brown sugar to make this a lower calorie dessert. No one even noticed.
804	28	It was literally ok, nothing more. Topping never crisped, took it out after 35 minutes. Topping just tastes like flour mostly with a little sugar. I’m the only one in my household that will eat it, no complaint there. Not the best but not the worst.
805	28	It took a good 30 minutes before it looked done. It sure did taste good though!
806	28	I used the suggestions to use oats and reduce the flour. 1 cup seemed like a lot of butter bit I gave it a fo anyway. t was so greasy!! The butter was pooling at the edges. I'm not a pro baker but I bake offen enough and have made apple crisp before but couldnt find the recipe I'd used previously so I tried this. Threw it in the garbage.
807	29	They forgot the liquid in the batter. I modified it by adding apple sauce and apple juice, plus I added cinnamon to the batter. They should remove or modify this recipe.
808	29	Needed to make something quick with my aging apples. It was simple, had all the ingredients I needed. But I did add cinnamon and allspice to my dry mix and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the wet. I debated cooking down the apples a bit before, but no need to.
809	29	Like other reviews, I have to add a bunch of milk to thin the batter out. I pour and mix until the creator tells me to stop! I add cinnamon to the flour mixture for an extra kick
810	29	I have made these twice, once with white flour and once with whole wheat flour, I use frozen sliced apples and they turned out great, will be my favorite go-to recipie.
811	29	These came out amazing! I followed the recipe- and several tips mentioned in reviews. Added cinnamon, allspice, and a splash of milk (oat milk) to the batter. Also seared the apple slices in butter before adding them which made them easier to mix into the batter. Everyone in the family loved them and we’re still snacking on them two days later.
812	29	These came out pretty good! I chopped granny smith apples into small pieces and let them sit in the sugar before adding to the mix, added all spice, and a splash of milk. They turned out delicious and were not dry!
813	29	These were quite tasty and easy to make.  Only took about 1.5 apples, I did not bother peeling and that worked out just fine.  I doubled the cinnamon in the topping to 1/4 tsp but next time I think I will also increase cinnamon in the topping and add cinnamon to the batter itself.  I think the recipe is a keeper but with more cinnamon.
814	29	Amazing … I did add milk to make the batter more liquidity, And added a sprinkle of all spice and cinnamon to the apples after they were cut to sit while I prepared the rest of the batter and idk if it made a difference but I (accidentally) waited until the muffins were almost done to add the topping absolutely delicious and moist! They turned out perfect
815	29	The topping is the only good part about this recipe. Muffins came out super dry and very flavorless. Definitely need more moisture in the dough and Definitely need to add cinnamon or something to the batter.
816	30	I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top. It was supposed to be a dessert for after dinner, but the aroma filled our house and lured the whole family out to the kitchen. Guess I'll have to make another batch!
817	30	I could have used more apples, but they were very good. I will try them on ice cream.
853	3	I have been making this recipe for years. I make a huge batch and cook it in the crockpot all day. Once the apples are really soft I mash everything up right in the crockpot and then let it cook for a bit more. My family likes it on the browner side. Sometimes I leave the sugar as is others I use way less...just depends on my mood but regardless of sugar amount used it's always delicious. It's good warm out of the crockpot and cold from the fridge too.
854	3	Very easy to make. I used 6 Gala apples and didn't add any sugar and it came out great! Will definitely make it again.
930	12	Loved this recipe. So easy and my family all love it and say it's the best apple crisp ever. I  wouldn't change a thing. Perfect as is.
818	30	Alrighty then Baker-Bees and Chef-Aronis!Here's my 2¢...Definitely pleasanly pleased!Wasn't quite sure with the twists I made!First of all, had just three apples although in an 8x8 Pyrex it made 3 perfect layers. I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite!
819	30	DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch.
820	30	I would use less nutmeg
821	30	This recipe did not turn out well for me. I used some Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples. The whole thing was just over spiced and came out dry and mealy. I was so hoping it was going to turn out well but it did not. Oh well. I'll look for another baked apple recipe.
822	30	Looks & tastes great, smells fantastic!
823	30	It definitely needed more water or some type of liquid but the spots that weren't dried out were really tasty.
824	30	Apple pie, baked apples ECT have never really been a favorite of mine but i had an abundance of red apples that i needed to use up so i gave  this a try. Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too.
825	31	My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.
826	31	This was perfection!  I did add 1 T lime juice in addition to the lemon juice.  I have used grapes, raisins (my favorite), and chopped up dates (which adds a toffee-like flavor).  This is a winner and it's quick to put together.  Thank you, Penny.
827	31	Very good! I did not have lemon juice but still good! Some people use whipped cream in the recipe
828	31	Easy and delicious!! Add more lemon juice to the dressing 👍
829	31	6-2-22 used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1 cup of green grapes. Yummy.6-14-22 made without the grapes, still delish but better with the grapes.
830	31	Made it exactly as written and it was lovely and yummy.  Now I can play with it a little for different flavors or make it just like this again.
831	31	This is pretty much the same way I've made my Waldorf salad for years. This time I substituted apple cider for the lemon juice, and it was awesome. Will continue to do this when I have cider available.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Sometimes I add green grapes, too. Such a good salad in winter.
832	31	It was good!  I didn't add the raisins as the apples I used (SweeTango) are plenty sweet already and I had to substitute pecans for walnuts, but everyone liked it.
833	31	Excellent!
834	1	husband loved it !
835	1	Very good but I had to add some cinnamon and fresh grated nutmeg.  Very good and not too sweet. My hubby couldn't wait and had to have a slice before his dinner.
836	1	This is a simple, rustic dessert. It is delicious, as is. I may add some cinnamon the next time. I used demerara sugar to top the crostada. Very tasty with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!
837	1	Easy to make, great for holidays to balance all the sweet desserts with this nice tart taste.  Great for dessert or for breakfast the next morning.
838	1	I make it as is - BUT - I add cinnamon to the sugar. It makes the flavor go a long way. The family and friends love it and its easy to make
839	1	Didn't have much flavor to the "filling".  I would rather just make an apple crisp or a pie.  If you really wanted to use the puff pastry, I would cut it in small squares and place the squares in a cupcake pan and still use the filling to make a small tart.
840	2	I thought this recipe was really good and simple to make. It’s a keeper!
841	2	Go to recipe for all holidays!  I usually add cinnamon and nutmeg to sugar mixture.Pie dough excellent for all pies.Love it!
842	2	I was very hesitant at first after looking at the ingredients I did exactly as instructed and could not believe the taste! This pie is, hands down, the best apple pie I have ever made!! You won’t be disappointed. Have one in the over now, added a sprinkle of cinnamon on top and left the top crust whole. Can’t wait to see how this one turns out. It will be wonderful I am sure!!
843	2	Excellent!  I followed the directions as written.  I let the pie cool for 45 minutes before slicing, and it was not runny at all; just perfect!  It's very rich for us so I will be making this as a holiday dessert item. But most likely for ALL holidays.  It's that good!
844	2	I've made this pie several times. Always a hit with the crowd.
845	2	I loved the recipe, I did add my own little touch by add a little bit of cinnamon in to the pastry (dough), and added extra cinnamon in to the pie, just because I love cinnamon so much😍😍😍
846	2	This is the best Apple pie I've ever tasted
847	2	Lori stop reinventing the recipe. am a chef and have made this pie for as long as I can remember and it has never disappointed. do not mix the apples with the sauce, a lot of water in apples
848	2	granny apples, pinch of nutmeg, egg wash, great pie
849	3	Perfectly simple recipe. Turned out great. Used Cosmic Crisp apples
850	3	Super easy. I made it without sugar. Apples were sweet enough.
851	3	Yum good easy
852	3	Made it because I had so many apples I received from the produce line.  My grandson loved it!
855	3	Wow was this good! I followed recipe. I used Granny Smith apples which worked really well. Served slightly warm and was really and amazing! Hadn’t made homemade applesauce before, but definitely will again!
856	3	I purchased a bag of small apples that weren't very good -- lacked flavor as an 'eatin apple'.  I was going to throw the apples out then saw this recipe.  I thought what the heck, I was going to throw them out anyway.  I made exactly as recipe called for using 8 of the small apples as they would suffice for 4 regular sized.  It turned out DELICIOUS.  Easy and I didn't waste those apples.  For some reason applesauce has really increased in price -- so glad I used those apples up for applesauce.  This is a WINNER!
857	3	Easy to make and pretty tasty! Using my food processor to mash the apples made it super easy! Next time, I'll cut down on amount of sugar added, that was a bit too much.
858	4	Want to take this recipe over the top? Scoop a half tablespoon of peanut butter into your bowl and stir it with this Apple crisp. Yum!
859	4	It was so delicous! The only thing i would do a little different is add less water.
860	4	I thickened the apples by cooking on top of the stove with the corn starch first then put in pan I think the topping may be a bit dry maybe more butter it’s in the oven so not sure it was not crumbly bit dusty I thought
861	4	I made this several times. The first time I added the water as the recipe calls for and it came out good but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it. So the next time I made it I omitted the water and it came out perfect! Also have experimented with different types of apples and granny smith is definitely the winner in my book. Thank you fir sharing the amazing recipe!
862	4	Loved it!  Perfect as is over vanilla ice cream!  Family and neighbors enjoyed this Apple Crisp recipe over vanilla ice cream!
863	4	Very very good as is.  Used glass dish.
864	4	the only changes i made were to use gluten free flour and coconut palm sugar. Fabulous!!
865	4	Good flavour. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Granny Smith apples and they turned into applesauce so next time I will NOT add water nor will I cut the slices too thin. The topping was delicious.
866	4	Love it!
867	5	I used 5 cups of water, as suggested by some. It was plenty. 10 cups would have been way too much. I hesitated at 1 cup corn starch, but it worked out well. Easy to do ( because I have an apple slicer lol).  Looks delicious.  Will use again.
868	5	I made this recipe several times and love it. However, I am very disappointed that All Recipes no longer offers the ability to automatically convert the size of servings. I want to pare the quantity down and find it tricky to work out the volume of water for a smaller portion and many reviewers seem to focus on too much liquid. I liked the older version of All Recipes better.
869	5	5 cups of water is plenty. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of cloves. I've made this recipe before and it always turns out great!
870	5	Super easy, I used 5 cups of water and it came out perfect.
871	5	This is a wonderful recipe, one I've used successfully for a couple of years.  I found a bag of the filling in my freezer from 12 months ago that needed using.
872	5	no way this needs 10 cups of water.  I used 5 and it was still too much.  I'd use 2 next time.   I also cut the sugar in half.
873	5	Excellect way to preserve apples for winter apple pies
874	5	I loved it.  it was easy to make and freeze  and tastes awesome
875	5	Way, way too much liquid.   I reduced this recipe for 2 pies, used 1/2 cider and 1/2 water with the cornstarch, sugar and spices.   I used 8 cups of sliced apples.  It looks like that I will have filling for one pie.  I may try this again, reducing the liquid, and increasing the amount of apples.   I used Golden Delicious apples, which is my "go to" apple for baking.    I am planning on using the leftover liquid to make an apple crisp.
876	6	I CONVERTED THIS FOR MY DIABETICS AND THEY LOVE IT!!!
877	6	I love this recipe! I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it.
878	6	Made it in a 9x13" pan (9" square would be too small).Quick and easy recipe.
879	6	Delicious!  Made 1 1/2 times the recipe and placed in a 9 x 13 pan.  Sweet, soft apples under a crunchy top.  Nothing better!  Served warm with ice cream.
880	6	I had a bin full of apples to be used up so picked this recipe for a quick apple crisp. The only thing I did different was to use about 50% more apples than called for since I had so many extra. Glad I did, because there was so much oat topping. I ended up using a bigger baking dish to accommodate having more apples. With the amount of topping this recipe makes I'm glad I used more apples and a bigger pan. It was ready to come out of the oven at 35 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!
881	6	easy to make and my friends all loved it!!
882	6	Loved this recipe! Tasty,  crisp topping, apples baked perfectly,  just so very good all around. I used a 8 X 11 baking dish and it was perfect.
883	6	My family LOVES this!!!  Doubled the recipe because it goes fast:-)))
884	6	Based on other people's reviews, I made some tweaks.I put in extra cinnamon and then sprinkled in some pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor, I also Added 2 or 3 tablespoons of water And a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used instant oats instead of rolled oats.The cinnamon that I used was McCormick's Organic ground Saigon cinnamon.It came out delicious!
885	7	Omitted brown sugar and allspice; cut two small oranges in half and stuck cloves in them. Boiled cider, oranges and cinnamon sticks for one-hour then warmed until serving.
886	7	Made it for my staff's annual holiday potluck. I added apple slices while it cooked. Then, I added whipped topping, caramel drizzle, and ground cinnamon as a topper. Staff LOVED it!!
887	7	I don’t even like cider but this was AMAZING!!!
888	7	I added a little orange rind zest. However the recipe is excellent. I just never give 5 stars, even to my own self.
889	7	You have to wonder about the people that rated this low weather or not they actually followed the directions. I followes the recipe then added 1 sliced orange and 1 sliced apple while it simmered all day! It tasted SOOO good!
890	7	I loved this cider but can't find whole allspice so had to use ground and do some sifting.  Froze it. Good to thaw it and heat it for a winter get together crowd
891	7	Very easy and good! Made with regular apple juice and added 2 slices of orange
892	7	This was great & will make again! I didn't put any additional sugar in this batch and it was still really good!
893	7	I made this the first time with ground spices because I didn't have whole ones. The second time I made it, I used the whole spices. Both versions turned out equally well.  It didn't have cheesecloth so I used my large tea diffuser with good results. Both times I had it in my crockpot for 3 hours on high.
894	8	Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect.
895	8	My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!!
896	8	Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples)
897	8	Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out.
898	8	Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.
899	8	Love, Love, Love!
900	8	I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.
901	8	Just used a little less sugar for the crumb topping.   I used dried cranberries which worked well.   Delicious!!!
902	8	Wonderful! This will be my go-to for crisps from now on!
903	9	I made it as exact as I could to recipe and it came out phenomenal.  . I was trying to make these as close to my moms recipe and I might have come CLOSE. THANKS!
904	9	I made this for dessert on a beautiful Fall Sunday. They were so fun for my daughter and I to make together! After the first half hour I covered in foil. They came out beautifully!  Just delicious as is or even better with some vanilla ice cream!
905	9	I read a few recipes and they are all pretty much similar to this olde fashioned one.. the only thing I altered is instead of water for the syrup I used apple cider.. they’re in the oven now and I can’t wait till they are done and cool a little bit before I can enjoy this first time I’ve made an apple dumpling ! Thanks to all who helped with this recipe!! -john G
906	9	Perfect recipe made twice. I added rum to the sauce! Wonderful served warm.
907	9	I liked the recipe. The only thing I did differently was I used crescent roll dough and I rolled it out. I cut up the apples and so I put everything on the dough, rolled it up, then sliced it into 10 pieces. when I was growing up, we called this "apple rings".
908	9	Iv made this recipe before but ig I read the ingredients wrong? I used Pillsbury biscuits and it was greats! Also I.   Didnt like the idea of half an apple inside so I whent ahead and chopped them into small strips. Maybe go with cubed or thinly sliced. The strips where difficult to stuff the dough
909	9	Smells amazing!!
910	9	Used pre-made gf pie dough to make these and it was amazing!! Didn’t used much of the sauce before baking and I loved it! Def recommend and will make again!!!
911	9	Very good!  Makes a lot of sauce so I only made half the amount the next time I made it and it was plenty.
912	10	I varied the recipe slightly1/2 c+ 1 T butter1/2 c white sugar1/2 c brown sugar1 T Cinnamon1/2 T NutmegI used a little extra butter because one of my apples was quite a bit larger than the rest. By NO stretch of the imagination am I a cook, so if I can do it, literally anyone can!It turned out fantastic. I'll definitely make this again!
913	10	My family loves these.  I make 2 versions as my son is diabetic. For his I use Stevia and for the rest of the family I make the regular recipe
914	10	Great pair with pork tenderloin.  So yummy.
915	10	Im a mediocre cook and this was extremely simple amd turned out delicious and that was with not a thing changed THANK YOU
916	10	I think they mean teaspoons not tablespoons of cinnamon.  The way it is written makes it overpowering.
917	10	So I changed it a bit.1/2 cup of unsalted butter1/2 white sugar1/2 brown sugar1 1/2 tb. Cinnamon1/2 tb. Nutmeg4 Granny Smith applesIt’s amazing
918	10	This is absolutely amazing!! i did however make another batch with brown sugar and it was SO GOOD! im 100% making this again
919	10	Follow recipe not changes pretty good going to make pancakes tomorrow and use up the rest of it
920	10	Just added a little more cinnamon
921	11	These are my changes and 5 stars!!!Use only 2 or 3 apples, there will be leftover filling. Can skip the water bath. 3x the cornstarch/water mix or until well coated and thick. In place of cinnamon use pumpkin pie spice. Add an egg wash before going in the oven.
922	11	These turnovers were amazingly delicious! So fluffy and not too sweet.  I added a little lime to the glaze and sprinkled some pecans. I’m definitely, making them again.
923	11	I love this recipe, it was so easy to make. I shared it with my daughter and I think she will love it just as well. Next time I am gonna try to add water to the edge before I seal it with a fork as it popped open and the Yummy sauce ran out as you can see in the picture. Also, you will notice mine are not rectangle as I bought puff pastry shells...oops! but I just rolled them out and made them work. I had some left over apples and made some single serving pies (in upper Left corner) they were just as Yummy!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.
924	11	Too many apples I had enough filling left over to fill another two or three. They are delicious, my husband loved them. Oh and I added some raisins while cooking the apples.
925	11	I've made these apple turnovers several times over the past few years and they always taste incredible. It is difficult sometimes to assemble the pastry and pinch it around the apple mixture without it oozing out. Regardless, it is my mom's favorite and I make it every year for Christmas morning. Also I veganize it by using Earth Balance butter sticks instead of regular butter. Delicious!
926	11	These are EXCELLENT, and I make them often. They taste even better than the ones you can buy from an apple orchard farm bakery.  The only changes I make are:  I use golden delicious apples because they are sweeter.  I dice the apples into very small cubes. I cook the mixture way longer than 2 minutes so that the apples get really soft.   I use less brown sugar; and DEFINITELY use parchment paper because it does make a mess!  Also make sure to use the glaze because it makes it even more delicious!
927	11	Oh my goodness, were these easy. I'm not the best cook so I can say with confidence these are foolproof. I didn't change a thing, except to take them out of the oven 5 minutes early. I'd say check them after 20 minutes or you risk over browning. Depends on your oven and how far they are from the heating element. I baked them on convection. Will definitely make again for my morning women's group.
932	12	Great recipe but I used brown sugar and less and CERTAINLY no need for salt.Add half oats as well as a change
933	12	This was delicious.  I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Plenty sweet.  Also, added one bag of instant oatmeal.  Yummy!
934	12	Loved it added more apples than suggested and added oats.
935	12	Easy apple crisp recipe which I was I was looking for.  I did add 3 cups of apples, rather than 2 1/2, but followed the remaining ingredients.  It turned out exactly as I hoped.  Very good recipe!
936	12	It was quick and delicious. I’m making it again this evening but adding more apples and reducing the sugar
937	12	Very good and simple. I added 1/2 cup sugar and t cinnamon to apples and 1/2 cup oatmeal to topping.
938	12	this is so easy and the best recipe yet! family loves it .
939	13	So, I meant to follow another person who reviewed by cutting the corn syrup to 3/4 cup. I forgot and used a cup. It is not a pleasant taste. It's thin, and whilst the apples look great I am not entirely happy with the taste... It's a bit sick tasting and the color is very light vs a deep rich carmel color. I will try it again although I WILL use less corn syrup and I will use dark corn syrup... hope it works out better. Also don't skip the taking the wax off the apples. Not entirely impressed .
940	13	I love this recipe. The directions were simple & very easy to follow.  I cut the recipe in half as I made this for my husband.    My apples are a little messy so I guess I have to work on my "appeal" factor.  ❤️❤️☺️
941	13	Read the reviews before trying! They are super helpful.This has been my third attempt at a caramel apple recipe and they turned out great. I used white sugar instead of brown, and I also cut down the corn syrup to 3/4 cup.It covered 10 small/medium Granny Smith apples, and can easily cover another 10 if I had more apples Lol I poured my leftovers into whatever silicone molds I had. The taste is fantasticThey were oily once set, but i’m sure less butter would do the trick
942	13	Carmel just slid off
943	13	Quadrupled the recipe and made 30 apples. This caramel was beautiful, smooth and had a perfect texture and flavor. Covered apples well and set up quickly. Will definitely make again.
944	13	This recipe was delicious! It was easy and coated the apples perfectly. I think it may cover a few more apples than indicated. I made them with my grandsons and since my daughter-in-law didn’t have a candy thermometer as soon as it started boiling  I had her help me check the temp using the cold water method, checking after 5 min, 5 min, 3 min until it reached the firm ball stage. It was simple and turned out perfectly. Definitely keeping this recipe!
945	13	I followed this recipe to the T. The caramel never seemed to get hot enough. When the thermometer showed 280 the caramel was beginning to burn. I dipped apples in and the caramel came right off. I swirled it over and over to fill empty spaces and it finally stayed on. The brown sugar never completely dissolved so I had brown spots on my apples. After the apples cooled down I tried to eat one. The caramel came completely off. The caramel was chewy and stuck to my teeth. I took pictures so I could show girls at work. They all laughed. This recipe is very expensive and I had to throw all the apples away. Very disappointed.
946	13	The sauce was way too thin. I cooked it to 248 degrees and even tried waiting a few minutes before dipping. The caramel is a giant puddle under the apple. Not thick like the picture showed. Not a good recipe.
947	13	Easier recipe I have done. The caramel actually sticks to the apples and  forms evenly over the apples. It takes timing and skill to add topping with you have "helpers" in the kitchen, but I'm so happy!
948	14	I make it at leat once a month.  We love it!
949	14	fantastic. added extra curry
950	14	This is one the greatest soups I have ever tasted. Highly recommend, I will be making this often.
951	14	I made this recipe as is, and have made it over and over again.  It is simple, and flavorful, and I highly recommend it.  If you aren't into curry, or Indian spice flavor profiles then this probably isn't your thing.  Otherwise it is amazing!
952	14	this was perfect as written
953	14	Excellent! Turned out exactly as described. I doubled the curry powder based on other reviews, yum! PS, I had leftover roasted chicken breast so I cubed that and added the chicken the last few minutes.
954	14	Delicious! Used a Granny Smith apple might try a sweeter one next time. I brown the chicken pieces before adding to soup.
955	14	Powerfully good! Best soup I’ve ever made.Went by the recipe, but used cooked rotisserie chicken that I added the last 10 minutes of cooking.Wow!
956	14	I had never had Mulligatawny soup, but wanted to give it a try.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This is a wonderful soup, I did forget the cream at the end, but I loved it anyway.  This soup will go into the Winter rotation of soups and will be made again and again.  This is very similar to another recipe on Simply Recipes, I took their suggestion and cubed the chicken before adding to the pot, along with some of their instructions for cooking the soup.  I doubled the curry and could have added more for our tastes.  Great soup!
957	15	Absolutely delicious as per recipe directions is! Family loved the dish.
958	15	I have used this for years as written.  Just be careful not to turn the apples into apple sauce.
959	15	Absolutely delicious! Apples need longer than 6-7 minutes if more than one layer in the pan.
960	15	Very tasty!
961	15	Made these apples and the family loved them.  They said it was as good as Cracker Barrel’s Apples.
962	15	As is, this recipe is so good, it made my house smell wonderful!  But I was hoping for a bit more of an apple pie filling taste, so I added a touch more brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added maybe 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves.  This was absolutely delicious over vanilla ice cream.
963	15	My husband had his doubts and made sure to verbalize them. I gave him a sample and he had no words. Took the wind right outta his sails. I don't get to do that often so THANK YOU SO MUCH! I put them in the middle of a corn bread loaf that is now cooking.  Again, thank you
964	15	FOR THOSE WITH A LOT OF APPLES: I tripled this recipe as I plan to freeze portions for use over the winter months and gift some. I will probably need to make at least four more triple batches to use up the half-bushel of Zestar apples I have. I add an additional half cup of water to a triple batch to make it more saucy for use as a topping for oatmeal, pancakes, pound cake and ice cream. I’ll use less water to make the recipe to use as a side dish with a main. I also added vanilla, nutmeg and salt but that is just personal preference as the recipe as written is absolutely delicious (although I really believe the salt heightens the apple flavor considerably).
966	16	I had a bunch of apples and decided to make apple cider. This recipe was pretty useful for a basic structure of how to make it. I follow my gut alot while cooking and used alot less sugar and alot more cinnamon and no allspice because we didn't have any. I also checked on it alot while simmering and it evaporated very much so I added water along with more sugar and cinnamon. The end result was very delicious apple cider.
967	16	This was fantastic!!! We had some apples that were going to go bad, so I quartered them up and followed another cooks idea to toss the whole thing in a crock pot. Simmered away on high for a couple hours, then cruised it to low. Strained it and it was wonderful. I cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup.. and it was perfect!
968	16	Had a bunch of apples sitting around that was going to go bad soon, so I made this! It was way better than the store bought kinds. Amazing! Will definitely make again if I have an excess of apples.And for the person who commented this isn't cider, fresh apple cider is not supposed to be alcoholic. Hard apple cider is fermented from fresh apple cider. Hope this helps!
969	16	Never made cider before but I had a ton on homegrown apples (champagne&yellow delicious) so I decided to try something new.  I had already canned applesauce and froze bags of apples for apple pies.  I did this recipe exactly as written but instead of allspice I added 2 teaspoons ground cloves. I don't like allspice.  The cider was excellent, but it doesn't make that much after cooking for 3 hours. Make sure you have a tight lid and just simmer last 2 hours.  About 2 quarts if you add a little more water the last hour of cooking.  I'll double the recipe next time.  I took the pulp that was left over and made spiced apple butter spread which I canned. I didn't even have to add any additional spice. Great recipe!
970	16	Great taste, and the house smells amazing while it's cooking. Definitely best when warm. I had less apples (but they were big), so I guesstimated the amounts, and was a little heavy-handed with the spices. The resulting cider is a little syrupy, but I assume straining with cheesecloth would have solved that problem (I didn't have any). I'm going to follow another review and use the leftover pulp in apple butter, another new experience. Great winter activity!
971	16	Simple, easy and everyone loved it. A little thick but not by much. When I bought the store brand I was surprised to see it taste just like the store bought brands will def make again.
972	16	Delicious.
973	16	I used Cloves instead of AllSpice because I just did not have any in the spice rack. Turned out tasty.
974	16	I just made this recipe, it turned out great, I like it. I’m used to having hot cider made from the packets so I was surprised when it didn’t take as sweet as that, but I really like it.
975	17	Definitely need to fill the jars at least 1/3 full with the sauce first, then add the apples. Otherwise the sauce does not go down to the bottom.
976	17	Love the recipe,  quick and easy.  Taste great. My only thing is I have so much liquid,  don't look like it will fill a pie shell. What should I do next time?
977	17	Fast and easy to make. The apple pie filling is so good I can eat it out of the jar. I will use this recipe from now on! I did not use food color or lemon juice.
978	17	I've been making this for years. Here's a tip. Divide sauce equally between 7 quart jars, then add sliced apples and push from top down until full. Much less messy.
979	17	Love it! I used clear gel instead of cornstarch , came out amazing!!
980	17	I've made lots of different apple pie fillings, but this was by far my favorite. It turned out beautiful and SO yummy! I doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg, but followed everything else as written. I already can't wait to whip up another batch for gifts. Thanks!
981	17	I didn't pre-congeal the syrup as it became virtually impossible to get into the jar around the apples.  It will boil up in the jar as it cans anyway, so I am conducting an experiment.  I got 100# of Honey Crisps, so anything that makes this more efficient will be GREAT.
982	17	I love this recipe!  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers though, and my house smells like Autumn.
983	17	I liked the recipe. The filling is tasty. This also freezes quite good. I have had a jar that did not seal. Instead of reprocessing the jar, I put the filling in a quart freezer bag and froze it and it tasted the same as the stuff in the jars.
984	18	I was very unhappy with the outcome of this pie. It ended up extremely watery.
985	18	I did not make any changes. This is a definite keeper.
986	18	no changes it came out perfect
987	18	Followed the recipe.  Yummy!
988	18	added brown sugar and vanilla came out great!
989	18	Really simple to make, apples still crisp
990	18	Instead of using store bought crust I did make it at home but it still tasted delicious
991	18	No I have not made any changes. Except we used margirin. We love the recipe
992	18	Made  as printed YUMMY
993	19	Rock-solid recipe. Followed it closely, but also added crushed pecans and in the second one, a small box of raisins, too. Tossed in a shake of ground clove to the apple coating. I used Gala apples that were just a bit too soft for eating, IMO. Keebler shortbread crust.
994	19	This pie tasted great, however the crumb is soggy after the first day, so I probably won’t be making it again. I liked that the apples were sliced thinly so that they were cooked thru and softened, rather than just cutting the apple into 8ths. I did add an extra tablespoon of flour to make the sauce thicker. That was a good idea.
995	19	This was awesome, the crumbles came out just right, the filling was not runny, and it was perfectly sweet, not overly sweet at all.  I made this exactly as written except I used Vegan butter instead of real butter.  Since I am not an experienced pie maker I took other reviews advice and used 6 medium Cosmic Crisp apples and I ended up- with way too much filling.  I only had one crust so I just made a crumble in a 2nd pie dish.  Even so, there was enough crumble for both pies.  Thanks so much for the recipe!
996	19	The recipe turned out really great I prefer no nuts in mine it was really easy to make and it's absolutely beautiful.
997	19	Yummo!  Came out perfect the 1st time.
998	19	I did make this pie but was very disappointed in what was supposed to be the crumb part. The crumb didn't come out the same way that it has in my past.
999	19	It turned out okay but needed to cook way longer than 25 minutes and not a lot of topping
1000	19	This turned out to be one of the best apple pies I’ve ever made!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!
1001	19	Easy to make and delicious.
1002	20	It's the easiest
6372	811	es lo que me queda coriendo en vida
1003	20	I made 50 caramel apples for an event. I was able to find very fresh Honeycrisp apples that were also fairly small. I used 8 lbs of caramels and about 1/2 cup of milk (maybe a bit more). This was very easy (except for the time involved in unwrapping 8 lbs of caramels!). I kept the melted caramel warm in a crockpot (I left the caramel in the measuring cup) and just popped the caramel back in the microwave for 10 second or so if it got too thick. Definitely freeze the apples first and take the advice to dip the apples in boiling water before freezing to remove the wax. These were a big hit and several people said they were the best caramel apples they had ever eaten!
1004	20	Best caramel apples we've ever made!  Followed the recipe and forgot to add the vanilla this time.  Still turned out great.
1005	20	Very simple and fun to make.  I made the mistake of putting the apples in the freezer overnight then putting the caramel and toppings on the next day.  They were so soggy when we ate them.  Definitely going to be refrigerating them only 15 min beforehand.
1006	20	Awesome. Extremely easy tastes great
1007	20	Tips from reviews:
1008	20	Worked great!
1009	20	Even after refrigerating it for 10 minutes (as some other users suggested), it was still super gooey and the caramel layer was thin because it was so gooey. I won’t be making this recipe again..
1010	20	sound  good
1011	21	This was absolutely delicious... I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and a white cake mix. It turned out awesome. Will be making this for Easter dinner this year. Thank you.
1012	21	We made several changes and swaps due to what was on hand and personal preference- 1 1/2c sugar, 4c frozen blueberries instead of apples, tablespoon of dried lavender instead of cinnamon, melted butter instead of oil. It was more like a cookie dough than cake batter and baked closer to an hour (guessing because blueberries are juicier than apples) but came out amazing
1013	21	Absolutely delicious! Super sweet and cinnamon-y! Very moist inside and slightly crunchy on top! Yum!!!
1014	21	German Apple Cake is the most insanely delicious dessert, also a great treat for breakfast, or cut into snack cake squares. My mom made it every fall when I was little and my friends started to beg her for it every September. Here are some important adjustments to this recipe—Use 2.5 cups all purpose flour instead of 2 cups. Also, add 2 tsp baking powder along with the 1 tsp baking soda. This should fix the “oily sloppy mess” issues and will balance the sugar. Use peeled Granny Smith apples even if you don’t like them. They become sweeter as they cook but hold on to just enough tartness to balance the 2 cups of sugar in the recipe. I also add 1 cup walnuts. The batter will be VERY thick & should give you a nice arm workout as you stir it. The secret ingredient that perfects this cake—sprinkle a bag of butterscotch chips over the cake before baking. The little hint of butterscotch & the added texture of the chips are the secret that makes this cake famous! Baking temp/time—I cook on 325 for 55-60 mins, sometimes longer. Cover with tin foil as soon as edges start browning, for me it’s always about 30-40 mins in. The bottom will burn with a cheap or thin pan, so if you have a thin pan that isn’t high quality, place tin foil on oven rack under the pan so it won’t burn. Sometimes it can take longer than 1 hour if your pan is glass or thick material, so be patient. It will seem like it’ll never be done, but stick a knife in the middle & as soon as it comes out without thick “raw batter” on it, it’s done (some moist residue on the knife is ok). Good luck everyone!
1015	21	Turned out great, but I did modify slightly. Macintosh apples are the gold standard. 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2. 6-8 cups of Macintosh apples. You can’t go wrong with more apples if you can fold them into this very thick batter. It does take some elbow grease.
1016	21	The cake itself is very good.  I used half white and half brown sugar and used 3/4 cup of each rather than a whole cup.  I made it with the cream cheese frosting.  The extremely sweet cream cheese frosting overpowered the taste of the cake so I would up scraping a lot of the icing off the cake.   I'll ake it again but with a different frosting.
1017	21	I make this cake several times a year, but I frost it with a cream cheese frosting.  I slice the apples, thinly. Don't use chunks. I use 2 tbsps. cinnamon, not tsps.  Hand grease the pan with softened butter. And I add chopped walnuts, too. Always use Granny Smith apples.
1018	21	I tried this recipe today and it was a total disaster. Although it was followed precisely, the „apple cake“ turned into a soggy mess, was far too sweet and left an oily residue on the plate. I would not do this cake again.
1019	21	Very easy to make.  Baked well and tastes delicious!!!
1020	22	Excellent.  Added one beaten egg to hold it together more. Doubled the stock (homemade) and doubled the butter. I'll chop the cranberries very small next time and reduce the amount. Used real herbs. Used pork sausage/less sodium.  Baked 40 min w foil. Uncover and bake another 20.
1021	22	The best stuffing I have ever made for 9 years now. My Father in law requested to cook for him on Christmas as my gift. My family loves it ❤️
1022	22	I have made this recipe for over 10 years now.  My entire family adores it!  And many people ask for the recipe.  I have made Gluten and Dairy free very easily.  I also don't stuff the turkey, I bake at 350 for 30-45 min.
1023	22	Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I think it’s a great recipe and everyone  liked it.  It will be even better next time because I’ll improve on these mistakes I made.  I used two different densities of bread; one disintegrated and the other was a little dry.  I will not double it next time because for 15 guests with several other side dishes there was a lot left over.
1024	22	I’ve been making this stuffing for over 20 years now, and it’s always been a huge hit w/everyone! This year I used 1/2 loaf“Dave’s whole wheat bread w/seeds”, along with the traditional 3/4 bag of sage and onion stuffing. [ I’m diabetic, and am trying to use mostly whole wheat bread ] I soaked my cranberries in fresh squeezed orange juice, to plump up, before adding them to my stuffing. (Yummy little pop of citrus!) I used Turkey stock, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the recipe. I also used 3 small Granny Smith apples chopped up. It tastes delicious & my husband can’t stop trying bites as he travels through the kitchen. LolI plan on stuffing my brined Turkey tomorrow, and cooking the rest in a pan lined with parchment paper (buttered) and will add a bit of Turkey stock if needed, as it cooks.Best recipe ever! :)Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
1025	22	This is my go-to stuffing recipe and my family members have asked for the recipe. I had to double the broth though, 3/4 cup just isn't enough.
1026	22	Everyone loves when I make this. Especially me.
1027	22	I have been making this stuffing for years now. My family loves loves loves it!
1256	141	Next time I won't use as much sugar. It was a little on the sweet side for me. But my husband seemed to enjoy it. So I will probably make it again.
1028	22	This has been a favorite every year for at least a decade. I cannot imagine a family Thanksgiving without it. My children, who are now grown, are continuing the tradition with their own families. I have never had anyone not like it. In fact, it is the first dish to run out.
1029	23	I made the dough and the apple filling. Didn't change anything. Well, I halved the filling recipe because I was short an apple, but it was delicious.
1030	23	This recipes is great. I added a touch of flour to the cinnamon in the last step for a little thickener.
1031	23	I made them exactly as the recipe stated. But the crust split open while baking. Not sure why but it still tasted great.
1032	23	I quadrupled the recipe to make  16 hand pies.   The apple cooked good and tasted great but I had to remove 1-1/2 cups of liquid from the frying pan because it was very watery.
1033	23	Beautiful and delicious! I did follow some reviews and halved the white sugar. My family does not like extra sweet. I also added some lemon juice to the apples, a little cinnamon, and some vanilla. I used homemade pie dough and my handy dandy new mini pie press. Lovely result!
1034	23	wonderful pies.  I added about 2 tsp more cinnamon, and only used brown sugar in the apple mixture.
1035	23	Made this today.  Took longer to cook down the apples than expected but eventually they got to the right consistency. Dough took me awhile to properly roll out because I’m very inexperienced and used very chilled dough. Didn’t help I made a double batch. In spite of my ineptitude they came out GREAT!  If a doufus like me can have a success with this recipe then it’s a solid keeper.
1036	23	I’ve made this recipe a bunch of times, and it inspired me to try different flavors. My favorite is to spread each pastry round with a little mango chutney, then I mix together 1 cup chopped fresh spinach with 1 cup diced paneer and season with curry powder for the filling.
1037	23	I tried these and loved them! Another time, I made these as a dinner pie switching the apples for chopped ham and broccoli, and instead of cinnamon and sugar I used some Dijon mustard. I sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top before baking. They were a big hit!
1038	24	I halfed the recipe because i didn't have that many apples. I also forgot to add the apple cider vinegar. But still came out yummy.
1039	24	This is my go to canning recipe for apple butter
1040	24	This turned out amazing.  I had a lot of apples that I needed to use so I made a double batch and I had two crockpots going. Both cooked at different temperatures so I had to make adjustments, but I had to cook on low for both of them.  I ran out of cloves so I only used a pinch of cloves but some family members don't care for cloves. I thought the allspice had enough clove in it to make sufficient without the cloves. Will be keeping this recipe and making it again.
1041	24	I did not make as much as the recipe called for and appreciated the ability to change the amount through allrecipes.
1042	24	Just finished canning this apple butter and it truly is amazing. So easy and the texture is perfect. Let it simmer overnight in my slow cooker. It did not scorch and by mid-morning it was ready to can. Only change I made was to add a little more cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Love that it is so low in refined sugar compared to other recipes.
1043	24	Actually made as directed, lil heavy handed on spices. Took lot longer in crock pot, to cook down than I expected, might try stove top next time, but Abble Butter was so Amazing, family raved.! But I would likecto Thank mostly for eady, step by step canning instructions,!!  It was my first, tryed other sites. But for me yours was so easy to understand. Turned out great, going to make more for gifts.
1044	24	I made about 20 small jars of this apple butter and 10 fresh loaves of bread cut lengthwise to give me 2 loaves out of each. These were then given as Christmas gifts to all my family. They loved it so much some wanted the recipe. I had a slice of homemade bread spread some peanut butter on it and then this apple butter and it took me back to my childhood days. Thank you for this recipe, so yummy
1045	24	Turned out great will make again
1046	24	I am making it again now! This time I have added some pears as I needed to use them before they spoiled. Smells and tastes great!
1047	25	Added 2 tbsp of sour cream, and used half brown and half white sugar.Made 12 delicious muffins
1048	25	We loved these muffins. Shared them with my neighbor who loved them too. The recipe makes 12 normal size muffins. Does anyone know if they freeze well?
1049	25	My family loves these muffins, but like many I too adjusted the recipe to my family's taste.  I am not a measuring kind of gal, but here is what I did. I split the sugar to about 1/3 white and 1/3 brown, added about a tsp of vanilla and a shake of nutmeg. I used 3 small gala apples cut into small chunks.  The mix was too thick for my liking, so at the end I added a splash of apple cider (maybe 1/3 cup).  For the topping I cut the butter to about 1/4 of a stick.  This recipe made 12 muffins which I had filled about 2/3 full.  I cooked them a bit longer than the recipe recommended and then eyeballed them and checked the middle before removing them from the oven.  I would say they were in about 30 minutes.  They came out great!
1050	25	These turned out amazing! I made mine gluten free with brown rice and 1/4 almond flour.  Used a little less butter for topping but melted it to mix easier. My husband said they taste like mini apple pies
1051	25	Like a different review said, DON'T fill to top it will overflow. Also make sure the butter for the topping is room temp. Otherwise it doesn't turn out like a crumbly topping and it spills over.
1052	25	Too much of butter topping, and 400 might be a bit too hot
1053	25	I made regular sized muffins (12), and did not need all the topping. The amounts for the topping could have been cut in half. What I have left will be great tossed into pancake batter!! Yummy
1054	25	I baked these this morning and they were great! I did some modifications as I’ve read some suggestions on the reviews - not filling it up to the brim, instead of white sugar, half of it was brown sugar, butter for topping was reduced to 1/4 cup! Turned out really well! Thank you for this recipe.
1055	25	Good but followed the suggestions on the prior reviews.
1056	26	This is a wonderful moist apple bread and easy to make.  I'm not sure why my 2 granny smith apples made 4 cups of chopped apples instead of the 2 cups the recipe called for, but I used all 4 cups.   I will definetly cut back to 2 cups.  It was a great bread anyway, just too many apples. I  had so much batter I made 6 muffins to be sure I had enough room in the bread pan.  This makes great muffins also!
1057	26	I like the apple bread. I like baking it.
1058	26	The bread did not raise - couldn't eat. I followed directions and put in the correct baking powder.
6411	815	Nice / easy salsa. Everyone enjoyed it.
1059	26	I read this recipe and it seemed just what I was looking for.  I had frozen apples I needed to use up.  I read the other reviews and I used a tip from one of the other reviews and used half light brown sugar and the other half the white sugar.  I did divide the batter in half used 2  9 X 5 pans which helped them to bake all the way through.  I baked them at the 350 for 30 mins then put tinfoil on the top as directed in recipe and baked for another 8 mins.  It is delicious and I am keeping this recipe as my go to apple bread recipe from now on. It did stick in my greased pan so next time I will either grease and flour or use parchment paper.  Thank you so much for this delicious treat.
1060	26	I had to cook this bread for 30 minutes more than the recipe called for. And, when I tasted it, it was way too sweet. I think only one cup of sugar is more appropriate rather than two.
1061	26	1/31/2023  I see by the earlier review I first made this bread in 2017!  Just made it for the umpteenth time because we had a huge bag of huge Fugi apples.  Again, this truly makes amazing...muffins!!  I'm still using half white/half brown sugar.  It seriously tastes like you are eating a caramel apple!Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in!
1062	26	I liked the recipe but it has more of a cake like consistency not like bread, at least for us. My daughter and I made it yesterday, Jan 30, to pay honor to my mother who passed five years ago. She loved to cook and my mom and daughter would often bake together.We changed a few things but the bread was moist and very delicious. I like cinnamon so I added a bit more than the recipe called for. We just ran out of eggs earlier today so I substituted baking soda and vinegar for the eggs (a trick I recently learned after baking a depression era chocolate cake).We didn't use vegetable oil but instead we used Country Crock vegetable spread. This has a higher water concentration and probably caused the bread to cook too fast.Otherwise, the recipe was fabulous and it turned out well. Oh, I cooked it on 350 as the recipe calls for but since it did cook a little too fast and burned just a teensy bit on the bottom, I will bake it at 325 next time.I put the foil on as directed in the recipe but it still browned quickly on top, corners and bottom. It might be because I used my stoneware loaf pan from Pampered Chef, but I love it.
1063	26	Followed the recipe exactly. It was raw in the middle. 1 hour bake time is not enough for this loaf.
1064	26	This Apple Bread is delicious! My family loved it.  First time I made one batch and baked in mini loaf pans.  They took a little more of time to bake, but waiting for the cakes to bake was not an issue because they were worth it! The second time I made two batches and used cupcake tins and they were even more delightful and great for a light breakfast, too.  Thanks for this simple recipe!
1065	27	I didn’t think they had muchflavor . They puffed up a lot and weredark on outside and doughy inside.
1066	27	Did not like this. I made as recipe called for. Dead apple fritters. No flavor. How do i remove this recipe. I would not make again. If i did i sure would add cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, more sugar.
1067	27	This is exactly the same as my grandma's recipe that we made as kids. Yum! We would sprinkle them with cinnamon sugar or powdered sugar or dip them in syrup.
1068	27	This is a great and simple recipe!! My 5th time making it.  I made a few adjustments by adding 1/4c  of sugar, 4c of apples, 1tsp of vanilla, a bit more milk, and reducing the amt. of baking powder.  I also added 2 tbs. of melted butter instead of oil.  Next time I'll try adding a bit of almond extract.
1069	27	I added a couple of splashes of milk in order to fully incorporate the dry ingredients.  I also added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg, and cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I'm super pleased with this recipe. The fritters were light and creamy. Definitely adding this to my recipes.
1070	27	you will not find taste like this at your local store! these apple fritters are soft moist and fluffy, full of flavor, free of preservatives and must be eaten within a couple of days, best if consumed immediately after being prepared!
1071	27	I added 1/2 T sugar, plus cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves; good that way and no glaze or cinnamon sugar was needed.
1072	27	Almost exactly the same as my mom's recipe!  She always served with sausage patties, and we ate them with syrup. My daughters always  loved them for supper whenever their dad had to go out of town!
1073	27	I disliked how crunchy the apples still were.
1074	28	Use yellow cake mix  about a cup and half  instead of flour mix with butter and crumble ...a game changer.
1075	28	Did not like the crumb topping.  Tasteless.  Is 1/4 cup brown sugar in recipe a typo?  Always disappointed when I try a new recipe and turns out it was just not worth the work.
1076	28	I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. The crumble on top reminded me of pie crust, and I thought it  tasted really good.
1077	28	Pretty tasty. I added a little extra brown sugar. A tip for the butter. I freeze it and used a cheese grater to help cut it into the flour mixture. I also turned the broiler on to brown the top.
1078	28	The topping is doughy. Not crispy at all.
1079	28	I used apple pie filling that was sweetened with sucralose and Truvia brown sugar to make this a lower calorie dessert. No one even noticed.
1080	28	It was literally ok, nothing more. Topping never crisped, took it out after 35 minutes. Topping just tastes like flour mostly with a little sugar. I’m the only one in my household that will eat it, no complaint there. Not the best but not the worst.
1081	28	It took a good 30 minutes before it looked done. It sure did taste good though!
1082	28	I used the suggestions to use oats and reduce the flour. 1 cup seemed like a lot of butter bit I gave it a fo anyway. t was so greasy!! The butter was pooling at the edges. I'm not a pro baker but I bake offen enough and have made apple crisp before but couldnt find the recipe I'd used previously so I tried this. Threw it in the garbage.
1083	29	They forgot the liquid in the batter. I modified it by adding apple sauce and apple juice, plus I added cinnamon to the batter. They should remove or modify this recipe.
1084	29	Needed to make something quick with my aging apples. It was simple, had all the ingredients I needed. But I did add cinnamon and allspice to my dry mix and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar in the wet. I debated cooking down the apples a bit before, but no need to.
1085	29	Like other reviews, I have to add a bunch of milk to thin the batter out. I pour and mix until the creator tells me to stop! I add cinnamon to the flour mixture for an extra kick
1086	29	I have made these twice, once with white flour and once with whole wheat flour, I use frozen sliced apples and they turned out great, will be my favorite go-to recipie.
1087	29	These came out amazing! I followed the recipe- and several tips mentioned in reviews. Added cinnamon, allspice, and a splash of milk (oat milk) to the batter. Also seared the apple slices in butter before adding them which made them easier to mix into the batter. Everyone in the family loved them and we’re still snacking on them two days later.
1088	29	These came out pretty good! I chopped granny smith apples into small pieces and let them sit in the sugar before adding to the mix, added all spice, and a splash of milk. They turned out delicious and were not dry!
1089	29	These were quite tasty and easy to make.  Only took about 1.5 apples, I did not bother peeling and that worked out just fine.  I doubled the cinnamon in the topping to 1/4 tsp but next time I think I will also increase cinnamon in the topping and add cinnamon to the batter itself.  I think the recipe is a keeper but with more cinnamon.
1090	29	Amazing … I did add milk to make the batter more liquidity, And added a sprinkle of all spice and cinnamon to the apples after they were cut to sit while I prepared the rest of the batter and idk if it made a difference but I (accidentally) waited until the muffins were almost done to add the topping absolutely delicious and moist! They turned out perfect
1091	29	The topping is the only good part about this recipe. Muffins came out super dry and very flavorless. Definitely need more moisture in the dough and Definitely need to add cinnamon or something to the batter.
1092	30	I'm not the best cook, but I am very happy with how this turned out!I had 8 medium-sized gala apples that needed to be used up, and they worked perfectly for this dish!I did read the comments before starting, so I followed the advice of some of the other commenters. I used about a 1/4 cup of applesauce and added just enough water to it to make it thinner. I added this instead of the water at the 30-minute mark. I then pulled it out 10 minutes later, stirred it, and added a crumble topping. I put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes until the crumble topping began to brown a little on top. It was supposed to be a dessert for after dinner, but the aroma filled our house and lured the whole family out to the kitchen. Guess I'll have to make another batch!
1093	30	I could have used more apples, but they were very good. I will try them on ice cream.
1094	30	Alrighty then Baker-Bees and Chef-Aronis!Here's my 2¢...Definitely pleasanly pleased!Wasn't quite sure with the twists I made!First of all, had just three apples although in an 8x8 Pyrex it made 3 perfect layers. I may do a pear mix in the future.Nextly...I made the approximate same amount of dry topping and glad I did as I don't see how that would have been enough for 6 apples.  I would recommend double for 6 apples.Then lacking vanilla suga-duga I substituted 2 tsp of white sugar and driziled a little vanilla ext on each layer as well as lemon juice. I was concerned the nutmeg and cinnamon would be too much although recommended amount was fine. Lastly, after 30 minutes in oven it did seem a bit dry and was concerned 3  1\\2 tbl of water would be to little! As per other comments I thought apple juice would be  more advantagous than water but alas I did not have that handy so...Lightbulb! I did have apple sauce and mixed that with water 3 to 1,  little over 1\\4 cup. Poured that over the top and mixed it all up! Then covered with foil for another 15 minutes. When I pulled it out it was a bubbling masterpiece!  How bout that!  Served over vanilla ice cream, whipped topping would also be good! One more idea, I think on top of a waffle would be scrumptious! Yum yum. Thanks for the recipie and Bon apitite!
1095	30	DELICIOUS! Nothing really fancy, but easy enough to make. I added a little more butter just because I like butter... Next time, I'm going to crumble some graham crackers on top just for some crunch.
1096	30	I would use less nutmeg
1097	30	This recipe did not turn out well for me. I used some Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples. The whole thing was just over spiced and came out dry and mealy. I was so hoping it was going to turn out well but it did not. Oh well. I'll look for another baked apple recipe.
1098	30	Looks & tastes great, smells fantastic!
1099	30	It definitely needed more water or some type of liquid but the spots that weren't dried out were really tasty.
1100	30	Apple pie, baked apples ECT have never really been a favorite of mine but i had an abundance of red apples that i needed to use up so i gave  this a try. Because i was preparing my apples prior to baking, i soaked them in lemon water until ready to assemble my dish. I followed the recipe except i added about a fourth cup of water mixed with a fourth cup of caramel ice cream topping. I buttered an aluminum pan and put in my apples, mixed them up with the dry mix then poured my water caramel mix in and mixed that up. I covered with foil and put it on my grill on low. Stirring occasionally to make sure the bottom wasnt burning. They came out great. Served with some vanilla bean ice cream while they were still warm.  I grilled because i happen to already be grilling but this would be great in the oven too.
1101	31	My mom made this when I was a child but she made it with Miracle whip instead of the sugar and lemon or the salt. I wouldn't do it any other way.
1102	31	This was perfection!  I did add 1 T lime juice in addition to the lemon juice.  I have used grapes, raisins (my favorite), and chopped up dates (which adds a toffee-like flavor).  This is a winner and it's quick to put together.  Thank you, Penny.
1103	31	Very good! I did not have lemon juice but still good! Some people use whipped cream in the recipe
1104	31	Easy and delicious!! Add more lemon juice to the dressing 👍
1105	31	6-2-22 used pecans instead of walnuts, added 1 cup of green grapes. Yummy.6-14-22 made without the grapes, still delish but better with the grapes.
1106	31	Made it exactly as written and it was lovely and yummy.  Now I can play with it a little for different flavors or make it just like this again.
1107	31	This is pretty much the same way I've made my Waldorf salad for years. This time I substituted apple cider for the lemon juice, and it was awesome. Will continue to do this when I have cider available.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Sometimes I add green grapes, too. Such a good salad in winter.
1108	31	It was good!  I didn't add the raisins as the apples I used (SweeTango) are plenty sweet already and I had to substitute pecans for walnuts, but everyone liked it.
1109	31	Excellent!
1110	125	Delicious I am so glad I tried this thing. It is sweet buttery.
1111	125	Easy and delicious. Follow the recipe and get a quick desert.
1112	125	Microwave for an extra 2 mins
1113	125	Great and easy.  98 outside so microwave was perfect.
1114	125	Recipe is great love them
1115	125	So easy and very delicious -- to serve one or more -- a super fast dessert!
1116	125	GIRL...i have been OBSESSED with making desserts in my microwave, I've made everything you could ever think of in my microwave..BUT THIS...IS THE BEST ONE IVE EVER DONE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
1117	125	This recipe was just the thing for "something different" for a side for dinner with pork chops.  I followed the recipe  adding more specific information as follows:. (ignore the picture which shows a peeled apple. )  I used gala apples, making sure, as stated, not to remove the entire core, used a glass loaf pan and covered the dish loosely with a paper plate for exactly 4 minutes.  (We have about a 1000 microwave.). The only change was cutting the nutmeg in half.  It was perfectly cooked and delicious.
1118	125	Worked great! I halved the apples after peeling, added chopped pecans, and I tossed the apples in the mix first to coat the peeled outsides, before sprinkling the rest on top. Then adding the butter
1119	126	No changes, loved it.
1120	126	I love this recipe!! I’ve used it for years and I’ve even used it as my base when I  used other Dutch Baby Pancakes recipes because it works better.
1121	126	Yummm! I used vanilla almond milk which I thought turned out fine. I also subbed brown sugar and I wouldn’t recommend that- it made it a chewier glaze effect. Overall, I’m glad no one else is home so I can enjoy alllll to myself! Thanks for the recipe
1122	126	Loved this! Perfect Christmas morning breakfast!
1123	126	This recipe was absolutely delicious. Are used a cast-iron pan and the edges are so wonderfully caramelized! Will definitely make this again!
1124	126	Best ever recipe.  I used brown sugar. Upped the amount of cinnamon.  I always get raves when I make this.
1125	126	I made this just as written. It was wonderful! The only issue I had was getting it out of the pan. I made it in my cast iron pan and it stuck in one small spot. I would recommend this highly! Great flavor! Very little syrup needed on this.
1126	126	Followed recipe to a “T”, but used brown sugar instead of sugar and omitted the nutmeg.  This is my favorite recipe for GermanApple Pancakes.  Turn out delicious every time.  Highly recommend making in an iron skillet.
1127	126	This recipe is out of this world. So delicious, not too sweet.  I drizzle fresh lemon on to it as soon as it comes out of the oven , then I sprinkle powdered sugar on it once it cools. Delicious with a little bit of caramel sauce. SOOO YUMMY . I also transfer out of the cast iron skillet for a nicer presentation.
1128	127	Simple recipe with great results!
1129	127	These were very bland, no sweetness at all. They were 1/2" high on the edges and 1" high in the middle, I won't make these again.  After writing this review, I made the last bath of muffins and filled the muffin cups to the brim. These muffins were 3/4" high and did not run over the brim while baking. Still, I won't make again.
1130	127	They were delicious! I did change 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 c stevia.
1131	127	This was delicious.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 C, added 2 medium apples.  I diced one and shredded the other.  I also added 1/4 C of melted butter.   Didn't add any topping,  They were sweet enough but not a dessert.  Had 2 for breakfast right out of the oven with butter and they were delicious.   Next time I'll increase the cinnamon for more flavor.   These changes reduced carbs even more.
1132	127	I like simple plain muffins but not ones that are super plain I like chunkymuffins to eat for breakfast and these are exceptional for that.thank you!
1133	127	This was a tasty, light, and easy to put together muffin. Used a large Royal Gala apple because they soften quickly and baked at 375 for 23 minutes on convection bake. My only complaint is they had a bit of an oily taste. I will replace oil for melted butter next time.
1134	127	This was delicious!! I made the apple sauce from scratch because all of my applesauce pouches were expired :( but it was super easy! Two apples cut up, a few quick squeezes of bottled lemon juice, about a half cup of water and some cinnamon. I put it in a pan and simmered for about 15 mins adding some more water when I saw it was dry. Then I pureed it in a small portable blender I have and voila! It was just a little over 1/2 a cup - which was perfect for this recipe! Since the apple sauce was hot, I folded it in after I mixed the wet and dry ingredients and folded in the cubed apples afterwards. A few other adjustments I made (but weren't necessary! just felt like doing it) was sprinkled some pumpkin spice blend (I'd say about 1/4 tsp) into the dry mix and I used two cut up apples for the fresh apples at the end - mainly because I wanted to get rid of them all before everything started to rot ;) Thank you so much to the maker of this recipe! It's very versatile and I think adding things like mini chocolate chips or walnuts would add to the texture nicely! I also was able to do this super fast - which was great for my sweet tooth! haha Saving this gem for the holidays!
1135	127	Flavourless, dense the batter was very dry (impossible to mix, i had to increase the milk). Definitely increase the sugar and applesauce if you make them. Shredding the apples will probably be nicer too.
1136	127	These came out beautiful and delicious. My family has a new favorite recipe for apple muffins. I'm making my second batch today. Btw- they freeze great.
1137	128	Cooked 1" boneless pork chops according to the recipe except reduced oven time to 20 minutes. Brown them for a minute or two on high. Otherwise the pork chops will be cooked before they go into the oven. The pork chops were perfectly cooked, juicy, and tender. For the apples we used  Granny Smith apples and they were perfect for this dish.
1138	128	For my family, we would like it a little spicier.Going to try that next time.
1139	128	Tasty and simple to make. I sometimes like to sub pears for the apples.
1140	128	After reading all the ingredients I felt the need to change a few things.  Less sugar, more mustard, less applesauce and shorter cooking time.  "Searing" is always a challenge with pork and I did it for a longer time than necessary.  Because of that I shortened the cooking time to 20 minutes (no need for chops to cook for 40 minutes at 375).  They came out nice not dry but a tad tough.  Hubby loved it.  Served in with a cabbage/apple/onion side.
1141	128	Made this several times always comes out good.  I even made it with 16 large chops for a big family dinner.  It was really easy.I had potatoes and gravy with it.  They ate everything so I believe they liked it!
1142	128	very easy to make. very good.
1143	128	I've made this recipe several times and the only change I've made is doubling it to get 2 meals.
1144	128	I've made this twice, last time I doubled the apples. Very tasty dish.
1145	128	I've made these several times and I'll let you in on a secret... add 1/4 bbq sauce to the applesauce mixture and they turn out EVEN BETTER!
1146	129	Made this last year and my MIL said it was exactly like her mommy used to make when she was a little girl.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. It’s a keeper!
1147	129	This is the best Apple butter I've ever tasted but I tweeked the recipe a bit. Instead of cloves, I used nutmeg. It's so good!
6412	815	Added some garlic powder and it was perfect
1148	129	I loved it.  I added 3 cups of sugar in layers to each crockpot and a few of those red hot cinnamon candies.  Also, since I wasn't sure what kind of apples I was using (we have several different trees), it was a little chunky this morning so I was lucky enough to have one of those hand mixers that has a whisk attachment.  A quick minute of whisking each pot and the jars were ready to fill.  So smooth.  Easy and tastes delicious.
1149	129	Used gala apples I peeled, cored and pulsed in my food processor a few times. Cooked them per the recipe except I forgot to turn the temp down all night. Wound up being just fine. After a few hours uncovered, I used my burr mixer to smooth it out. Canned it in my canner and was able to make 7 beautiful jars. Delicious!
1150	129	This turned out great!  I was even able to speed up the process by cooking it on high for 5 hours instead of all day.  Yum!
1151	129	Loved this recipe! Except I made some modifications, instead of cloves I used apple pie spice. Also did not add any salt to my batch. Turned out great both times.
1152	129	Made it as is just cut in 1/2. Husband loves it too on English muffins with his morning coffee.
1153	129	Excellent base recipe! Definitely a keeper! Used Gala and Pink Lady apples- 3lbs each. Chopped up apples into bite size pieces- added 1 3/4 cups light brown sugar, 2 Tsp ground cloves,   1TBSP cinnamon, 2 tsp apple pie spice. Mixed and using a food processor chopped into smaller bits- this had to be done in small batches. Placed back in crock pot, covered and cooked on low for 10 hrs- checking to mash down larger bits. Removed and put in processor again and processed til a smooth consistency. Returned to the crock pot and cooked on high for 1hr mixing occasionally. Consistency thickens as it cools. Canned in 1/2 pint jars- yield 4-6 jars.
1154	129	It turned out great , I put them in sterilized jars and put them in a hot bath to seal, will make again , so easy
1155	130	For some reason, I made over double the muffins. I guess I used much smaller muffins cups but they are delicious!!!
1156	130	Was perfect as is
1157	130	These muffins were excellent!  I make them often.  I think next time I will cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and try 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.
1158	130	Our favourites with a few modifications. Less sugar 3/4 cup (sometimes brown sugar); less oil (2/3 cup) added 1/2 cup each of unsalted sunflower seeds and pepita seeds. Also have to bake about 5-10 minutes longer.Paul
1159	130	I lost my very favourite morning glory muffin, so opted to try these.  Simplify by buying your carrots already shredded, plump your raisins and toasting nuts brings out flavour, although I didn't with the walnuts.  Jury is still out on this recipe, they really look flat topped when taken out of the oven.
1160	130	Excellent recipe. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce, cut walnut to half and topped up with unsalted sunflower seeds. Perfect breakfast muffins. Just my preferences, but awesome recipe to take off from! Thanks. 😊
1161	130	I’ve made these twice and they turned out great both times. I substituted pecans instead of walnuts and used cranberries instead of raisins. Also used half cup apple sauce half cup oil. Will make these again and again!
1162	130	These are delicious, and they are now a stable in our house.   We tweaked a few things to make this healthier without changing the flavor/texture:used half regular flour, half whole wheatlowered sugar to 3/4Cinstead of 1C oil, used 1/2C oil + 1/2C applesauce
1163	130	The muffins taste good but they collapsed in the centers. I would not use this recipe again.. baking soda and no baking powder makes collapsed muffins. I can’t give them away like I was intending to.
1164	131	This was good, but a little dry.  I made a syrup using butter brown sugar an a little white sugar, and added some cinnamon.  Mad it in microwave.  Poured the syrup over top and it made it just right!
1165	131	It was dry, as some have noted.  Agree with mixing the sugar and cinnamon with the apples instead of sprinkling on top.  Next time I will try a different recipe.
1166	131	The ingredient amounts are way off. Not enough mix to cover an 8 X 8 pan. Double the oats and flour.
1167	131	Delicious with any fruit as a base. Poured out a jar of blueberry pie filling and then I put all the crisp on top instead of making it a sandwich. Will be trying my peach pie filling next!
1168	131	I followed the recipe to the T. They taste good but did not rise at all. It was not the yeast; it had a good date on it.
1169	131	Exactly how I've made it for 50 years! Ice cream or whipped cream and it can't be beat!!
1170	131	I made it by instructions, but with about 4 cups of apples chopped.  Was wonderful!  Next time will try with some raisins.
1171	131	Way too sweet and dry and not edible. Very disappointed with it.  However, I made my own adjustments and was happy with the results.
1172	131	Simple and very tasty! Will be a go to for our family.
1173	132	I made these this morning and they were fantastic! Easy fast recipe. Pancakes fluffed up nicely. Just the right amount of apple flavor and not too sweet.
1174	132	I just shredded and mixed this mostly in the food processor with peeled cored fuji apples and it came out just what I was hoping for.  I added soaked dehydrated pecans, and mini dark chocolate chips.
1175	132	Added a pinch of salt! They were a big hit with the family.
1176	132	Claggy and wet. No rise. Bland.
1177	132	These were by far, the best pancakes that I have ever made.  I replaced the flour and the baking powder with 1 ¼ cups of Birch Blenders Organic Original Pancake Mix.  I also increased the cinnamon to total of 1 teaspoon and  the sugar to a total of 2 tablespoons.  These results came out perfect and not too sweet.  Plus, the pancakes even looked as good as they tasted.
1178	132	I altered this recipe based on the prior reviews I doubled the cinnamon and used brown sugar instead of white. I made a nice light apple compote for the top . It was a definite crowd pleaser
1179	132	After tasting a tester, quadrupled the cinnamon and added a half teaspoon of salt to balance the sweetness. Came out great!
1180	132	So easy to make!!  The texture is a bit different but reminds me of apple pie.  I added 1/8 of a teaspoon of nutmeg to really make the "apple pie" idea pop.  Great for gifts: put dry goods in a jelly jar and put an apple on top with a bow.  Will make again!!
1181	132	the first time i made these, last autumn, i thought they were pretty bland - but i had a cold and figured it was from that.  Made them again today and they were still bland.  They need some salt and some more cinnamon and maybe some other spices -allspice, nutmeg, ginger...  We made some apple compote to have with them and that made them pop.  They're quite dense and filling - we did not eat anywhere near as many as we thought we would.
6413	816	Great!
1182	133	I think this is a very flexible recipe. I've used it as the basic, but altered it by using chocolate chips, lemon and coconut, replace part of the flour with cocoa powder, added nuts, spices and other things (it's called imagination). Highly recommend this recipe and play with it! That's what baking's all about!
1183	133	I made it as the recipe stands and I should have read the reviews first. The bread is very moist and has a great crumb, however the flavor is very insipid. Both the amount of spices and a little edge are needed  - whether through adding lemon or vinegar - to make this really good.
1184	133	Excellent recipe. I used my homemade applesauce so cut sugar in half. I also doubled the spices just because I like the flavors. Bread is moist and very tasty. New family favorite.
1185	133	Perfect! It's super-moist and has the perfect texture. I only had 1 egg so I used 1/4 cup Greek yogurt as a sub for the 2nd egg.  I used coconut oil and I used half the amount of sugar because my homemade apple sauce  was very sweet and didn't want a very sweet bread. Definitely a keeper!
1186	133	Just amazing. So yummy and great recipe for fall. Thank you bunches.
1187	133	Very good as is & you can add to it!!
1188	133	It smelled so good cooking and was very moist.
1189	133	Delicious. Next time I make it I might use a sweetened applesauce.
1190	133	I gave this recipe 5 starts.....the flavor is just delicious.   Although, I did tweek it just a bit.  I added 1/4 cup bran and walnuts instead of pecans.   I did also dust the top with a cinnamon/sugar sprinkle.   Great recipe!
1191	134	Came out perfectly! Baked at 375 for 40 minutes with foil on top the entire time. Really helped to keep the color and prevent the apples from browning. Also important to leave a lot of the apple slice sticking out when you fold your pastry over, otherwise it won't look like petals.
1192	134	A bit doughy on the bottom, but generally okay.  Better looking than tasting.  Not as tasty as a great piece of apple pie, or a bowl of decent apple crisp.  I split one with my husband because it's very filling.  I also lowered the oven temp to 375, and it cooked fine.
1193	134	What an elegant and simple desert. Very nice presentation for entertaining.
1194	134	Awesome Chef John!!! Love these
1195	134	A little Mardi Gras theme with purple, green, and golden colored sugar on top.
1196	134	Great Gluten Free! Apple Roses. Excellent with hot tea and friends.
1197	134	Fun to bake. I took kabob skewers taped leaves to them and then put the apples on top and put them in a vase. Made an absolute beautiful bouquet. They were very delicious
1198	134	Video well done! I laughed and was delightfully entertained.  Thanks chef!
1199	134	I made these apple roses today. They are yummy! I will make again and again. See my picture of my Apple roses.
1200	135	this recipe is spot on yum -a- licious
1201	135	Don’t use the recipe as is. Try the recommendations from the first comment.Otherwise, runny
1202	135	Modified this recipe, as most others did. I used cinnamon-raisin bread as my bread cubes and omitted the extra raisins. Turned out great!
1203	135	Good flavor, but it is way too sweet and way too moist. Adding the sauce would make it worse. Still, the flavor of both is good. Also, I wish I had used apples that were little tangier.
1204	135	This is an absolute Keeper that everyone enjoyed!  I decided to serve with a vanilla bean ice cream instead of the sauce but will try it with the sauce the next I make it. Yum!
1205	135	I wanted to add to my review with this suggestion. I used my apple corer/peeler. It made it easy to just cut up the apple after running it through and less apple is lost in the peeling.
1206	135	I've never been a bread pudding fan, but I had a few crusts of bread I needed to use and I figured hubby would like it.  I just made a half a recipe, but it was quick and easy to prepare. It was very tasty by itself, but the vanilla sauce brings it upto stellar! I used half and half for the milk, and butter in place of margarine. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!
1207	135	Thank you for the inspiration as I love bread pudding! Because  I want to eat this I had to make some substitutes.  I used Trader Joe’s gluten free Brioche bread, and cashew nut milk, although I still used eggs. I doubled the amount of the sauce.  I happened to have frozen wild blueberries I got at Costco so used them instead of raisins & apples.  The result was beautiful and yummy.  Someone suggested using melted vanilla ice cream so I told that route.  Oh My...it was diViNe!
1208	135	This recipe has potential but MUCH too sweet the way it is! Even my kids said so! It could have done with 1/2 c brown sugar in the bread and apple mixture. I made it with leftover brioche which was very nice. Baked for 45 min, perfect consistency.  I used half the amount of sugar for the sauce and 1/4 cup heavy cream + 1/4 cup milk which added a richness to the sauce!  Will try it again but with half the amount of sugar next time.
1209	136	Made to recipe everyone really enjoyed it.
1210	136	bake pie crust for 5mins prior to filling with apples, increase flour to 3T, added 6 cups apples, omit allspice.
1211	136	Very good taste very moist would recommend it to other people
1212	136	Amazing
1213	136	i didn't like the oatmeal streusel.  I think i like it better without the oatmeal.
1214	136	Came out very good. Im not a big fan of apple pie's, but the streusel topping is a big plus.
1215	136	I make this pie every year for thanksgiving at the request of my family. It never lasts 24 hours which is saying something given that we are a family of four. I change nothing. The recipe is wonderful as is!
1216	136	Love this recipe!!
1217	136	Very delicious!!! Thank you for your awesome recipe!!
1218	137	I use the same recipe the only difference is I use crushed Cinnamon toast crunch and it makes it really good
1219	137	Really good.  Made no changes.  Had to cook longer than suggested.
1220	137	It is really good! I used stick butter and the butter was not melted by the time the 15 minutes was up so I put it in for 3 more and then in the microwave for 2 more. Then it melted. But it is really good!
1221	137	Simple and delicious, thanks Lucynda
1222	137	Meh. If I make this again I will make them open-faced for more of the oat mixture to get crispy. House does smell amazing though.
1223	137	This was good cause what’s not to like but it seriously underperformed. I think with a little more effort, longer cooking time and some addition spices like ground clove, ginger, nutmeg, maybe some nuts, this could be really outstanding. I’d give it 2.5 stars if I could
1332	150	This wasway, way too much salt in the recipe. Clearly, somebody messed up.
1224	137	Perfect for a quick dessert - I prepared the apples in their own individual ramekins, and as soon as dinner was out of the oven I popped them in. By the time we were finished dinner they were ready - a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and voila!
1225	137	Quick, easy and delicious!
1226	137	Pretty doggone good!
1227	138	I used 1 apple and 1 pear, 1 cup golden raisins, and 1 cup diced candied ginger because I'm not that fond of currants, raisins, etc.  After the addition of the brandy the mixture seemed much too soupy.  I will wait to see how it looks in 10 days' time when I bake my mince pies, but I may opt to cook off some of the liquid.
1228	138	This is a brilliant recipe! Do NOT heed the naysayers and nit-pickers who want to make substitutions. It’s perfect! And thank you, supply chain, for forcing me to make my own. I will never go back.
1229	138	Thank you for sharing!  I made it, thought it looked a little runny after adding the orange juice, didn't have any brandy, but it thickened up nicely after cooling a bit more and tasted amazing.   I will be making this again.
1230	138	Soupy, not a good balance of ingredients.  One apple to a whole cup of brandy!  Also note the amounts given serve 24, which would be like a square inch of pie.  After cooking, I added 2 pears, more raisins, and a bit of minute tapioca before baking in a pie.
1231	138	had to play with the butter a little
1232	138	I've never made mincemeat before (it's always been easier to buy it back in the UK), but I've been in the US for three years now. So for Thanksgiving I'm making a load of British treats for my american roomies. This is, hands down, the best tasting mincemeat I've ever tried.  I had to replace the currants with dried cranberries, and I'm using orange juice rather than booze, but it's totally worth making for yourself.
1233	138	I used 2 big green apples.  Used dried cranberries for currents and vanilla brandy
1234	138	Just not for us. I used the best ingredients, so it wasn't that. It's an acquired taste. I  was disappointed.
1235	139	I love allrecipes! I typically read through reviews and adjust the recipe hear and there. This recipe had very few recommendations so I stuck pretty close.  I used panko because it's what I had and added about 1-2 TBS fresh chopped parsley because it needed to be used.  Doubled the sauce.  I used a bundt pan (with 1 C water in pot) instead of loaf shape in foil. Cooked for 25 minutes and NR.  Drained the grease off and flipped it out of bundt pan onto foil lined pan and broiled as directed. I put half the sauce on top and half the sauce heated in a pan on the stove for anyone who wanted.  Huge hit!!!
1236	139	Flavor great! But not sure I like it cooked in insta pot rather then oven.
1237	139	The only thing that I didn't like was the glaze, I will use a different one next time but otherwise it cooked great in the instapot and 4min on broil came out awesome.
1238	139	I used half ground beef and half Turkey. Yummy
1239	139	Yum. So delicious. My husband loved it. I love the sweet and sour taste combination so it’s a winner here. I did it according to the recipe.
1240	139	Very good! I had 3 pounds beef & adjusted the ingredients according, with 28 minutes pressure cooked.  Seemed dry going in but the apple & onion added the wonderful moisture and flavor.  My 2 Childcare toddlers loved it and they're usually picky with meats.  Served the bbq sauce on the side but I know it would be fabulous broiled as described.
1241	139	Excellent. I thought that doing the "pre-broil" was brilliant! It allowed the surface of the loaf to brown and dry just out enough that the glaze (which I will double up on the next time) really adhered to the loaf well.
1242	139	Liked the flavor a lot AFTER I had to finish baking it in the oven. Like another reviewer, my ends were done, but the middle was raw and I used less than 2 lbs of meat. NBD I'll just add more time next time, or make 2 small loaves. But it was delicious!
1243	139	Made the recipe exactly as written, and it's great except that the cooking time is not enough. Add another five to eight minutes and you should be good.
1244	140	This was wonderful!  Perfection in cinnamon and nutmeg.Everyone enjoyed!  I used MacIntosh apples.  A cooking apple.For those that say it's too runny, do your research!  All apples are used differently.Read.  Understand.  Then you will enjoy!
1245	140	I made it according to the recipe, but it didn't work for me.  I used a juicy sweet apple (Macintosh), and my apples didn't cook through, my pie was soupy, and my crust didn't brown.  The flavor was almost there.  The ingredients and cooking need some modifications, which I will attempt the next time I make it. Maybe add more flour, some lemon juice, adjust the oven temp., etc.  Again, this was my experience.     It might work better for others using different apples.
1246	140	This was an easy recipe (and very similar to the recipe on the pie crust packaging)… we opted to skip the nutmeg. Also, we took the recommendation of one of the reviews to increase the secondary baking temp to 375°f.
1247	140	it was soo good i ate it like 8 times this week
1248	140	I followed the recipe and added 2 Tblsp of corn starch. It turned out pretty good, but it was still too watery and it needed to bake for over an hour.  The picture is of when it was just finished and before I cooled and cut it.
1249	140	I Baked this pie for my Brother in law. He loves Apple 🥧 pie. He said it was Awesome! It's what he wanted for his Birthday from me. The only thing I added was more cut up apples for the height and about a teaspoon of cornstarch along with the flour.  It turned  out so Delicious 😋
1250	140	I folllowed the ingredients and used Granny Smith apples.   I started off at 425 degrees for 10 min  then turned the oven down to 375.With all the complaints of a watery pie I figured ithe 300 degrees recommended was not a high enough temp to thicken the sugar and flour.  Turned out perfect.
1251	140	It came out very watery, even after added time in the oven. And even with Granny Smith apples, it was too sweet for my taste. So if I made it again, less sugar and more flour.
1252	140	This recipe was good although I did it a bit differently. I tossed the apples in the mixture that was to go over the top. I did a cinnamon and sugar sprinkle on the top of the crust and my family loved the pie. I made the everything as the recipe said but put it together a little differently.
1253	141	This recipe was very tasty.  I especially liked the comment about cooking apples first with reduced sugar and cinnamon.  No leakage  in my strudel and left over filling is yummy applesauce.   I have made this 2 times with great results.  :)
1254	141	There seemed to be way too much filling. I just used the extra as a topping for ice cream. Absolutely delicious!!! And easy!!!!
1255	141	Yes, I used Apple pie filling as I had decided to make this at the last minute. Made my own sugar topping with raw sugar and 1 packet vanilla sugar mixed sprinkled over egg wash.
1257	141	This is a fast and simple recipe.  I precooked the apples with the sugar (reduced to 1/2 c.) until tender and juices were reduced.  Allowed to cool, then mixed in raisins, cinnamon (only 1 teaspoon), and walnuts.  Precooking the apples kept the juices from making the pastry soggy on the bottom and assured that the apples were cooked completely.
1258	141	Yummy! Yummy! Easy to make and tastes great. There was so much apple filling that I made a second strudel.
1259	142	they were great only thing i changed was I didn't mash the apples
1260	142	This was the first time I’ve ever made fried pies. Only problem I was into was not having enough dough. But now I know I’ll make more next time.
1261	142	I did not have shortening but used plant-based butter for the dough. Despite how they look, for my first time I think they came out ok. They taste really really good though.
1262	142	Very yummy but had to make more filling!
1263	142	This recipe is so supper yummy!
1264	142	Made this mainly for the crust portion. Of course I had to include the apple portion!
1265	142	So good!! Thank you for the recipe! The only change I made was to double the apple filling. I got 9 pies out of this! I made the filling and dough the day before. Assembling the pies and cooking them was easy! What I thought would be a big task and messy kitchen was very manageable! I’m going to make some people very happy!
1266	142	The recipe is awesome... Loved every bit of it. I used butter instead of shortenings and half tsp of cinnamon.. But thank you so much for the recipe
1267	142	Brilliant! I only half-way mashed the filling, leaving it a bit more chunky. It was a hit!
1268	143	I think it's good!!!! Yummy.... Only changes I made was I added a little more cinnamon and two or three tablespoons of amaretto and let it marinate for a couple hours.
1269	143	Yum
1270	143	Really good for such a simple recipe. The only change that I made was to cut back the sugar.
1271	143	Delish!!  My only comment is : Peel your Apples people!!  ????
1272	143	Only thing is I added 1/4 cup of water because my apples were dry.  I halved this recipe with no problem.  Will make again.
1273	143	So I did this with a twist, I cooked them in my well-seasoned cast iron skillet with peaches and plums thrown in too. It took on a slightly savory aftertaste and I’d highly recommend it! It would go really well with some lamb chops the way mine came out.
1274	143	Followed recipe. Almost as good as my grandmother's.
1275	143	This was very good. The family really loved it. I made the following adjustments I tossed the apples in 1 TBLS corn starch and added a dash of cloves. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Absolutely delicious and had a perfect cinnamon caramel sauce. Thank you for such a quick and easy recipe.
1276	143	Tasty and pretty easy
1277	144	It was pretty easy and delicious! I have made a lot of apple pies, but never in a cast iron skillet. I’m always afraid that food will stick to  it, but so many people swear by their cast iron so I’m trying to get over the fear lol. This recipe didn’t stick at all. 😊I have an easy recipe for pie crust so I made my own, and I used a 12” skillet since I don't have a 9” one. It took a little longer to cook than the stated time but it turned out beautifully. I had two pieces. Yum!!
1278	144	Really delicious recipe, only used 2 pie crusts and 6 apples.
1279	144	Back off on the sugar and add rum soaked raisins,was delicious.
1280	144	this is an amazing recipe, i sometimes try different things as cooks do but the base recipe itself is unbelievably delicious. the reviews giving less than 5 stars arent doing the actual recipe they are doing the changes they made
1281	144	I used a bit less white sugar and a little more cinnamon. Baked it 10 extra minutes. Easy peasy recipe . Delicious!!!!
1282	144	So, while we liked this pie as is, I have altered the recipe a little bit.1. I only used 1/2 stick of butter in the skillet, rather than a whole one.2. I only used 1/3 cup brown sugar with the butter in the skillet. The rest goes in the dry mix.3. I only use 3/4 cup white sugar, plus a tblsp to sprinkle on the top.4. I add the following spices: 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp ground cloves.5. I mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and then coat the apple slices before filling the pastry.The cloves really add a little something that people really like, but just can't quite identify, until I tell them the 'secret' ingredient.
1283	144	Delicious and EASY. The brown sugar was stuck to the bottom under the pie crust. It wouldn't dip out. Not sure I'll ever get my skillet clean again. Only used 2 crusts. Used 4 granny Smith and one red apple. Used apple pie spice instead of plain cinnamon.
1284	144	It's great! I cut back on the sugar by 1/3 because I used 7 medium-sized really sweet Gala apples that were about to turn, and as I sprinkled sugar, and saw it pile up, it seemed to be too much. Everything else went super well, just as per recipe!  Wish I had 4 more apples in the pie! I will use this recipe again and leave the apple slices bigger for more body.  Beautifully flaky, sweet, sticky and delicious!
1285	144	This is my 4th year to make this. It’s become a family favorite. The first year, the nephews and nieces asked me to bring another the next day for breakfast, so now I just make two. I make it as written, although I could probably cut back on the sugar a bit.
1286	145	I had to bake all day!  finally left them in the oven overnight and they crisped up.  Not worth it!
1287	145	My kids absolutely loved them. They were gone in less than 5 minutes.
1288	145	Fast and easy!! Love it!!
1289	145	So, so good! I made them as the recipe said - they were great! But, I like a little heat - so for the next batch, I added Cayenne Pepper to the Cinnamon Sugar Mixture - Wow! I added about a teaspoon to the mix.  If you like heat, add as much or as little as you like - YUM! Thanks for the recipe! Next time I'll add more heat.
1290	145	i only used cinnamon and not sugar
1291	145	So easy & healthy & yummy! I didn’t add sugar because I used really sweet apples, and I first cooked them for two hours, flipping halfway through. I sent some with my daughter to school the next day, and she said they were very chewy and she couldn’t even eat them. However, I re-cooked them and let them stay in the oven overnight at 200 degrees, and now they’re extra crispy and delicious! I did the same thing with the skin from other apples I peeled, and they turned out great too! Just lay out the apples in single layers and sprinkle w/cinnamon & cook.
1292	145	Best ever recipe for apple chips.
1293	145	The first time I made these I sliced the apples too thin. They all stuck so bad to my metal pan I had to scrape them off. It was a total loss.
1392	156	No just like recipe
1393	156	Awesome recipe. Delicious and super moist. It went fast! Will be making again for sure.
1294	145	Here are my notes: 1: parchment paper lining helps with transfer and removal once they are baked. 2: the thickness of your slice will determine the baking time—check the progress every 10-15 minutes!
1295	146	Used Dolgo crab apples.  Put the small apples whole into the pot and boiled, macerated and filtered as instructed.  Did not need pectin since  the crab apples have enough.  Turned out perfect.
1296	146	Way too much sugar.  If you're cooking whole apples with the core and skins, no added pectin is required. Butter? Don't think it's necessary if you're spooning off the foam.
1297	146	Huge mistake on my part to not think ahead - do NOT put the pectin directly into your fruit mixture!! My pectin turned all globby. Even when trying to fish them out and chop them up in a food processor, my jelly still looks funky.
1298	146	Easy to make..well know if it set in 24 hrs..added cinnamon
1299	146	First time ever making Jelly. It was an easy recipe to follow.
1300	146	Followed the recipe exactly as stated & I too have syrup instead of jelly!
1301	146	I love it, tastes so good. I did have to add 2 packets , 1.75 oz each to get the proper consistency of Jelly.  Highly recommended, it really tastes delicious! The juice processed is really good too. I made 2 extra quarts of it because it was so good. Great recipe!
1302	146	Turned out perfect. I'm sure I made a few modifications I can't remember now, but the basic recipe is what I used. I tried different combinations of apples. I had the best luck with Jonathan apples. I did three batches.  Two batches with winesap and one with Jonathan. (My said Jonathan apples had to be good for something.) Turns out he was right.
1303	146	For all of you that have runny jelly, note that one package of iSure Jell is 1.8 oz, and NOT 2oz. If using Sure Jell than you must add more than just one pack.
1304	147	I made this for Easter today. I wanted to get ahead so shredded cabbage (first salting and draining), shredded the carrot and chopped peppers and mixed it together the day before. I made the dressing but kept it separate. A couple hours before serving I sliced the apples and put in veggie mix and added the dressing. I then put it in the refrigerator til time to eat. All of the adults thought it was delicious. There was a-bit too much liquid which I needed to drain - perhaps from settling in the fridge. Enjoyed with tacos!
1305	147	Excellent as written. Next batch I made added pecans, celery (to add to the crunch factor & to use up the celery on hand.  Plus a tablespoon of dried mustard pow?der to counter the sweetness level. This just just my version. The original recipe is excellent. Next time maybe raisins?
1306	147	Loved the bright flavors in this.The sweet, sour… Perfect for early Spring!!!
1307	147	This was my first attempt at homemade cole slaw.  This is one of the best slaws I've ever had.  I doubled the dressing amounts for a more creamy slaw.
1308	147	We LOVE this slaw recipe. Today when I made it, I had to use dark brown sugar, and since we like slaw a little tangier, in addition to the lemon I used 2 Tab. of apple cider vinegar, and we loved it plus it thinned the dressing some.
1309	147	This is a great recipe for any gathering. My husband and I loved it. Lots of taste and texture.
1310	147	Sooooo yummy!  A perfect side to BBQ pork.
1311	147	It's a good jumping off point, but I found it to be a little bland. I added salt, pepper, and some apple cider vinegar and that was a big improvement. Next time I might add cilantro and jalapeno.
1312	147	Awesome. Added the pecans and cranberries. Not necessary but good. Husband put minced jalapenos in his. If course. Little less sugar, too
1313	148	Made this today - turned out really well. I used Gala apples instead of Granny Smith and cut the sugar in half. Also threw in a handful of sliced almonds. It was nicely golden brown after 30 minutes.
1314	148	I used Phyllo Pastry and it turned out Awesome. It was so easy to make. I was second guessing myself on this. But I will be making this from now on.Thank you all for the help.
1315	148	This is my husbands absolute favorite. It's his "special" birthday dessert... but I make it sugar free by using swerve. I also cook it on the stove top for a while until the apples are softer then add them to the pastry. Really tasty!
1316	148	It was delicious.  I added a little nutmeg & Cinnamon
1317	148	Very easy absolutely delicious!!!Love it
1318	148	Yum!!
1319	148	Very easy. I would just recommend to check the oven after 30 minutes. Mine got burned after 35 minutes. I just removed the burned area
1320	148	Flavor is OK, that gets it two stars. The bad news, have spoon to eat it with. There will be no classic crust, or light flaky crust. No need for fork or knife, nothing to cut or poke at, unless you are trying to strain the apples from all the juice.
1321	148	Great and Easy to make
1322	149	Tastes great. Instructions were a bit unclear at times but that's probably my own reading comprehension problem. Will be making this again.
1323	149	Doubled the spices as a reviewer suggested, but it was still very bland. Tasted okay but needed something to give it a distinct flavor.
1324	149	Don't use pre-seasoned tenderloins, overpowers these flavors.
1325	149	I used pork loin roast, not tenderloin. As long as I kept an eye on 145 degrees, I felt it was cooked as written. Either way, this is a keeper and glad I used grannies.
1326	149	Fantastic recipe! My husband and adult son really raved about how good it is.  I did add cooked sweet potato chuncks which added a different taste and texture.  I will make it again.
1327	149	Easy preparation and terrific result.  It's clearly a fall classic. I cooked it for an early November dinner --  freshly harvested apples and onions are abundant this time of year. My guests loved it and so did my wife and I.  This will be part of our regular rotation.
1328	149	This was delicious! Best pork I have ever made, as good as a restaurant. Will be adding to my rotation of dinners.
1329	149	This recipe is so delicious and will be a go to in our house! Very easy to make and ingredient amounts are spot on. Wonderful compliment and balance of flavors in the entire dish. I used a gala apple as that’s what I had on hand. I also cubed a sweet potato I needed to use up and tossed them in the skillet about 2 min before adding the apples and onion. My pork tenderloin was just under a pound and my cook time was less, as expected. Served with steamed green beans. Thank you for this lovely recipe, Bibi!
1330	149	I served it with asparagus and noodles.
1331	150	We used to have a stall sell these at our local rotary markets and always loved them. These were a pretty close replica. Think after reading reviews that I’d agree to reducing the salt amount and reducing the amount of dried fruit added in. But overall yummy ??
1333	150	I moved to America when I was four years old and we always made Oliebollen.  My mother made the dough and my father always fried them up using my mother's metal knitting needles as probes to turn them and skewer them out of the hot oil. This tastes just like I remember and they always had currents and raisins unlike what some other posts have said.
1334	150	Made exactly as recipe directed .  Too salty, and no matter how small I scooped them, they were raw and doughy  on the inside.  I have made oliebollen every year but lost my recipe, so I quickly went to this site for a new recipe.  I will lose this one and hopefully find the original.
1335	150	These are AWESOME!!!
1336	150	These turned out great!! I've never made them before and was so stoked with the outcome!! I did need to use about 1/3 cup or so more milk to get the right consistency. Saving for next time!!
1337	150	I cut the salt to 1/2 tsp,  added 1/4 cup granulated sugar to dough and also added a. tsp of cinnamon to the powdered sugar and THEN, these were amazingly good! Best eaten warm. We aren't Dutch but I think, based on my 2 yr.  old grandsons reaction of "yummy, yummy" we have decided to adopt this tradition as well. Seriously good!  Rated a 5 with these changes.
1338	150	As a real Dutchie I can recommend this recipe to everybody! I haven't had oliebollen since I left The Netherlands and now made them myself with this recipe and I love them. I did cut back on the salt, currants, and raisins. 1 tsp salt, 1/4 cup currants, and 1/4 cup raisins.
1339	150	After reading a few review, I added 2 tsp of sugar  and decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. Also my dough needed a 1/4 cup of more milk. Otherwise mine was the same as my Dutch neighbour's. Thanks for the recipe!
1340	151	I scaled down to serve  2 and had trouble getting the brandy to ignite at that scale; I also replaced the cherry extract with vanilla. Overall the results were still delicious, though for me it was a little too saucy for the amount of cherries (I might add less water next time). I also want to try crumbling Graham crackers on top! Or pour this sauce over cheesecake.
1341	151	Found that I had to add more juice/water as it was gooing up in the saucepan. Hard time lighting the brandy. Was yummy just over vanilla ice cream!
1342	151	Not difficult, served over ice cream to top off Christmas dinner.  Delicious and festive!
1343	151	I used lemon rind instead of orange.
1344	151	Great Classic Cherries Jubilee recipe...Made it several times
1345	151	My hubby made  this for me on Valentine’s Day fir dinner. He is a non cook!  I got all the ingredients out and printed the recipe for him.  Then he served me a glass of wine  whilst he cooked, sauced and flamed away!  It was delicious and apparently easy too!
1346	151	Very good and easy to make.   I did not flame my dessert after adding brandy and still tasted great.
1347	151	Taste is awesome! Hard to get the flame though. Be ready to serve, the ice cream melts quickly
1348	151	Made it last night for some out of town guests. Everyone was wowed!!
1349	152	I have made this recipe multiple times with different types of fruit: strawberries, mixed berries, apples and cherries. I have alsoused fresh or frozen fruit. It is an excellent recipe and very easy.
1350	152	i thought it to be very simple ty
1351	152	Ugh this was horrible!!! I only halved the sugar and kept everything else the same. I didn't over-mix it, but it came out rubbery and greasy. It was not at all like a cobbler. Very disappointed.
1352	152	I would use less sugar the next time I made it—very sweet. However I did not use sour cherries so that could be the difference. Otherwise it is a very good recipe!
1353	152	I made this with a mix of sweet red cherries and sweet yellow cherries, and only the ingredients given in the recipe, but definitely added more than 2 cups of cherries. It was a perfect way to use cherries picked by my grandkids when I took them cherry picking this week.Having just had my first taste of this dessert, I would definitely recommend it! It was easy to make (after the cherries were pitted), and tastes delicious!
1354	152	So easy and so good! I went cherry picking, and ten pounds of cherries later, went looking for a good recipe. This one was great!
1355	152	I kept trying to think of what this reminds me of. Another reviewer nailed it. Pineapple upside down cake. It was interesting to watch how the cherries and biscuit layers swapped placed. I used 3 cups of cherries. Could definitely used more. I liked it and I'm not sure if I'd make it again as I'm curious to try other recipes. All in all, very easy prep and it was quite tasty.
1356	152	I did add more cherries.  The guys at  work liked it so much I had to make another batch for them.
1357	152	pretty good but a tad sweet. also I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla.
1358	153	Oh my goodness,  this was so easy. Thank you. I made it with mangos and sprinkled pecan short bread cookies on top. I will never have to buy pies from the restaurant again.
1359	153	I needed to double the recipe in order to fill my 9" pie dish and used frozen cherries.  It came out wonderfully-thicker than canned cherry pie filling.  I found it to be much too sweet.  I would halve the sugar next time I make it, but otherwise this was spot on.  I did not find the need to make a slurry with the cornstarch.  The lumpiness you can get depends a great deal on how powdery the cornstarch is to begin with versus clumpy when you dump it in the pan.
1360	153	I used frozen, unsugared sweet cherries.  I added a little water to cook the cherries.  I removed and cooled 1 cup of the cooking liquid/juice.  Then added 1/2 cup Splenda for baking product and 1/2cup cornstarch plus 1capful of almond extract and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  Once everything was dissolved, I added it to the warm cherries and cooked until it thickened.  I put cold pie filling in my homemade crust and baked.  Yummmm!
1361	153	I added almond extract and made a slurry of cornstarch (using the extract and cold water). My first attempt at this recipe resulted in clumps of cornstarch, which no one wants.
1362	153	This cherry pie filling is delightful I have always used sour cherries but our sweet cherry tree had a bumper crop this year.
1363	153	So easy to make!! I followed one of the suggestions from a previous reviewer (suggesting to put the cornstarch in a bit of water beforehand and stir it up), and it worked perfectly.I made oobleck without realizing so I added a bit more water so it was all stirred in smoothly :)Tastes yummy!! :)
1364	153	This pie filling is perfect. I didn't have fresh or frozen cherries, so I used a quart of canned tart cherries. I mixed the sugar and cornstarch with only the juice. After it  boils for a minute, stir in the cherries. It thickens up beautifully!
1365	153	I followed the recipe to a t and it turned out perfect!
1551	176	So delicious!  I used long grain jasmine rice and doubled the recipe,.
1366	153	This seemed too easy to work, but it does! And it is delicious! I halved the sugar, though, since that was one reason I wanted to make my own cherry filling.Everyone loved it.
1367	154	i made it and baked it in two loaf pans.  absolutely the best, moist, delicious fruit cake i have made
1368	154	My family enjoys this recipe. I have made it for the holidays several times. I never use citron, I use a different blend of dried fruits and fresh lemon orange zest. Very good!
1369	154	The best recipe ever! I have used this recipe for 15 years and still love it!
1370	154	This is a good basis for a fruitcake!  I used raisins, dried apricots and cherries, dates and a few prunes.  I didn't have the usual fruit used in fruitcakes ( I made this one COLD spring day that seemed more like winter than summer).  I love the flavor and will make a more conventional fruitcake combo in November adding some of the candied fruit.  I've been looking for a good recipe for fruitcake for a long time and I think this is it!
1371	154	I was very excited about this recipe, but it didn’t work for me. The flavour was great, but the cake seemed too dry. Not at all what I was looking for. The boiled mixture looked like a nice smooth caramel, which lends a nice flavour and smell to the cake, but it is too dry.
1372	154	I have made this particular fruit cake for the last two holiday seasons. We love it! I have varied the types of candied fruit, even making my own to add.
1373	154	Like most others, I give this recipe 5 stars.  All the reviews had good ideas that I wanted to incorporate, so I printed the recipe and jotted down various ideas.  I soaked my chopped fruit in Captain Morgans Rum 3 to 5 days in advance.  I really like lots of pecans in my fruitcake, so I added 2 cups (not chopped) vs. 1 cup.  I also used 1/4 c. molasses and cut back 1/4 c. on the sugar and milk.  I baked at 325° for 25 minutes and then 300° for 42 minutes.  Next time I will line the bottoms of the loaf pans with parchment paper.  Had a little trouble with one sticking to the bottom.  Before I wrapped these up in waxed paper and cling wrap, I basted with rum.  Now I'm basting with rum about every 5 days until I'm ready to giving these away.  When I pull them out to baste, I have a taster loaf that I've tried a couple times now.  Oh man!  Is it ever good.  I think the recipe could be renamed Fruitcake Crack or Fruitcake Addiction!

1375	154	Excellent
1376	155	I’ve recently become fond of a Southern Comfort Old Fashioned
1377	155	This is a awesome stiff drink. Takes me back to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in the air plane scene. Enjoy
1378	155	I’m a booze wimp, so I used 2 sugar cubes in mine, but most love just one. Really yummy. It has become my new favorite cocktail!
1379	155	Love this drink! Best with rye whiskey which has a unique flavor. Nice to find a refreshing whiskey drink!
1380	155	I omit the lemon and the cherry and add 4 dashes of orange bitters with 2 dashes of Angostura bitters. Then I burn the edges of the orange rind before dropping into the glass for a little smoke flavoring
1381	155	Solid recipe. Don't forget to make xlarge ice cubes. Definitely worth it.
1382	155	Solid recipe.
1383	155	Very good. Can also substitute simple syrup for sugar cube and water.
1384	155	I’ve gained ten pounds because of my beloved whiskey sours. I’ve switched to this to save calories. Delicious!
1385	156	Change nothing! This recipe is exactly as it should be.
1386	156	I loved it. My first time baking a cake since a highschool classroom, over 25 years ago, and I'll definitely be baking more. I followed the directions as is, and it came out great. The only difference I did, the store didn't have yellow cake mix, so I used white. For the pudding mix, I used lemon. Again, I loved it, and thank you for the recipe.
1387	156	Perfect 🍰 CakeNothing but praise 🙌🏾🥰
1388	156	I tried to follow this recipe as written as so many said that they did and it turned out wonderful.  First, the recipe calls for an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings. It appears by most photos that everyone used a larger can by how many pineapple rings are on their cakes.  I could not find an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings so purchased a Dole 20 oz. can (in heavy syrup) and measured out what would be 8 oz. which turned out to be 4 pineapple rings and about 1/3 cup of juice. (That kinda makes no sense because now I needed 2/3 cup of milk and she calls for 1/4 cup or as needed - this seems like a big leap but that's ok - I did use 2/3 cup of milk to bring that to 1 cup). I did decide to use another couple of pineapple rings from the  can because it looked too sparse just using 4 which didn't seem to make any difference in the end anyway. Secondly, the recipe calls for an 18.25 oz boxed yellow cake mix.  What I found was 15.25 oz. Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. Could this be the reason why so many cakes are coming up with too much moisture?  Maybe. Thirdly, like many others at 40 minutes a wooden skewer showed that my cake was still not baked through.  I left it another 10 minutes (a total of 50 minutes) and then it was done perfectly.  Making those changes though - made an absolutely terrific Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt® Cake! Couldn't give it the 5 stars I wanted to for all of the diversions I had to make to the original recipe buts it was 5 stars after my changes.  I hope that helps some others!
1389	156	This was great! Easy! I cooked it for 40 minutes @350°    I substituted raspberries for the cherries. I did find that letting it sit for about an hour made the cake less fragile when I cut it. I also served homemade whipped cream on top with 4-5 fresh raspberries on the side.
1390	156	A couple of notes about this recipe; first the baking time is off, most bundt cakes need at least an hour of bake time. Second, I think the amount of butter for the topping needs to be reduced, maybe 1/4 cup would work better as this is not being baked in the traditional cast iron or 9x13 pan. I dried my pineapple and cherries before putting them in the pan. Hope this helps. I will definitely make it again, it’s delicious and look beautiful.
1391	156	Beautiful and delicious!  I think I'm going to use the same basic recipe and make a lemon upside down Bundt cake.  Love the caramelized butter/pineapple/cherries.  Made the cake look quite elegant.
1394	157	A tasty and functioning recipe. Nice cake. After reading reviews I used my 12" Calphalon skillet which worked well. For me, it was cloyingly sweet. I will try again sometime cutting sugar in the batter by 1/3 and topping butter and sugar by one half.
1395	157	This recipe was great!  Using a 10" cast iron skillet I would reduce the butter and sugar slightly.  Using the recipe as is in a 12" cast iron skillet would have been perfect.  Next time I'll try separating the eggs first and add whipped egg whites in at the end for more fluff.
1396	157	This is the recipe I use for my son- in -law's birthday cake. He loves pineapple upside down cake. My daughter who professes not to like  pineapple upside down cake, even loves this one. I can't imagine how many tries it takes to develop and perfect a winning recipe that works so well and I wouldn't think of changing one ingredient, or measurement making this cake.  Well done!
1397	157	Best pineapple upside down cake I ever made. Like baking in cast iron. Followed recipe exactly…. Let sit 10 minutes before flipping. Excellent, only recipe I’ll ever use….sold!
1398	157	It's great! The cake is light and fluffy like a box mix.I used maybe only 4 tbsp of butter instead of an entire stick for the bottom/top.I reduced the brown sugar to about a 1/2 cup instead of 1 and 1/2 cups and added 2 tsp of Jack Daniels.Reduced white sugar to 1.25 cups instead of 1.5.Used buttermilk to activate the 1 tsp of baking soda I substituted for 1 of 2 tsp of baking powder.Substituted 1 tsp of Jack Daniels for 1 of the 2 tsps of vanilla extract.
1399	157	num num
1400	157	This was delicious!  Based on the reviews about what pan size to use, I used a #8, my largest cast iron, and cut the recipe in half.  The pineapples fit beautifully in the #8.  As you can see from the photo, it ended up being a rather thin cake.  Next time I'm either going to try cutting the recipe in half again and using my #6 pan or doing the full recipe in my #8.  The only reason I rated this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 was because there's no pan size listed.
1401	157	This is the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever eaten.  Getting ready to make it again.
1402	157	Looks Great! Happy Birthday, Sally!!!
1403	158	I'm not a huge fan of chocolate covered cherries, but my husband is.  We've been married 20 years and I've always given him this candy at Christmas, but it has gotten nearly impossible to find the "good" kind, so I thought I would try this recipe.  WOW!  I found organic (no artificial color added) cherries but they didn't have a stem so I used a toothpick and drizzled a bit of the melted chocolate to cover the hole.  I made them three weeks in advance and the filling turned a nice liquid just like the good brands used to be.  I may become a fan of this candy yet!  Thanks so much to the cook that posted this!  Note to those finding the process messy, it is important to dry the cherries!!
1404	158	Easy easy! I don’t use corn syrup for anything so I replaced with water. I only used a tsp of water and with the butter I still made a firm dough.  Very yummy, was a big hit with the family.
1405	158	use cherries with stems and do half corn syrup and have cherry juice
1406	158	I microwaved chocolate.  Other than that, great recipe.
1407	158	I changed the chocolate to white chocolate
1408	158	This was fun and easy.
1409	158	great recipe, better than store bought !   Will be making these every Christmas!
1410	158	These turned out well,
1411	158	These were AMAZINGLY GOOD!!  I did have to make 2 batches of the white creme part to cover all of the cherries.  Make sure to get the cherries w/stems the recipe calls for!  Everyone loved these!
1412	159	I use 6 foil loaf pans to bake then and I  use toothpick method, about 50 mins. that way you can put them in ziplock bags for freezer after they cool in their pans. They last a while and you don't eat it all at once. Easier to share. At Christmas, for special friends, I just pull 1 or 2 loaves out of the freezer,  thaw. Remove from bag (if you want) and at that time of year you can usually find decorative plastic bags to put it in as a gift. Make sure you use a plastic that has good closures. I usually present it, in its loaf pan, to keep freshness. Suggestion: maybe you can use bottle style bags to fit the pan in. You may want to put it in Dry ziplock or any proper size freezer bags if using liquor store bags made of just heavy paper. You only need to open the foil a little and it will always pop out, if you greased your pans etc.
1413	159	It is the best & moist cake. My mother makes them every Christmas.
1414	159	This cake was super yummy.  Next time I’m not going to add the raisins or the nuts for personal preference only. Will definitely make again!
1415	159	fantastically yummy
1416	159	I got the starter from a friend and although the final cake is good, it cost me $100 from start to finish! Good cake .... NOT worth the cost! If you have to make the starter, add on another $50! Not so much friendship! :(
1417	159	I am giving this 4 only because I haven't baked the cake yet, but the starter looks and tastes great! My 50 days is up tomorrow and I'm confused by the cake recipe. I know I need to freeze the starter if I'm not going to use it within a week. If I am going to use it within a week, do I put it in a jar on the counter or put in the fridge? I know the starter can be used to make another batch of starter, but how much do you use and what do you put in future starter batches? Thanks. I hope I get answers by tomorrow!
1418	159	I remember my mother making this in the 90's. I was so happy to find this recipe. I had to start the starter so this has been 50 days in the making. I was very worried because towards the end of the process my fruit smelled like bad homemade wine, but I stuck it out and the end product was really good moist, tasty fruit cake. This recipe makes 4 cakes. I used loaf pans. I baked the first 2 at 325 as called for but the center didn't rise and kind of sunk. The next 2 I baked st 350 for about 55 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I've got another fruit starter going now I plan on making small loaf pans and giving to neighbors for Christmas. Thanks for this recipe.
1419	159	We love the cake.  It says you can freeze the cakes for later. Does anyone know for how long?  Also, does anyone know if you can freeze the fruit?  One more question:   what can the starter be frozen in?
1420	159	I have been making friendship cakes for over 20 yrs  & everyone loves them! this recipe is a little different than mine,I add 2 & 1/2 cups of sugar to the peaches  & the  pineapple ,but add no sugar to the cherries.This recipe doesn't mention if you drain the juice from the cherries(I do) on the 30th day my cakes (cause I make 3 at a time)consist of only the yellow cake mixes,eggs,vanilla instant pudding,cooking oil & 1 & 1/2 cups of fruit  per cake.I bake them in a tube pan.at 350 oven for 1 hr.  I am looking forward to trying this recipe that adds nuts,coconut & raisons.Thankyou!
1549	176	Have made this multiple times. I’ve generally preferred using 1/4 cup of raisins going in with the sugar and milk instead of 2 tablespoons of dried cherries towards the end.
1421	160	I did make it... Followed the posted recipe as closely as possible. Unable to find currants, I used a mix of dried dates and dried cranberries as a substitute. Not sure why the recipe calls for reserving the liquid from the sour cherries (then never has it used).Turned out pretty good. Wasn't too difficult. The recipe made enough for two pies. I baked one pie and froze the rest of the mix for another pie.
1422	160	This is a great pie to make, but it takes planning.    A bit of advice for the next baker, for the round steak, ask the butcher to grind it up like hamburger (run through grinder 3 times).  This will save you a huge step and eliminate the chopping after cooking the meat.  I also recommend making your own candied citrus peel.  This is another step in advance that can take 2-3 days for the peel to dry, but well worth it.  I used a combination of grapefruit, lemons, limes and oranges.  There are many recipes on-line and best way to peel the fruit is to use a kitchen potatoe peeler to take the peel off the fruit, otherwise it is a challenge, now that I did it the other way.  Enjoy!
1423	160	I have never had real mincemeat pie before so I wanted to try this, and am very glad I did.  The taste was so much better than the stuff in the jar.  I would recommend serving it warm with whipped cream on top.
1424	160	I have a questions about this pie before making/rating it; hopefully, someone knows the answer.  The recipe says to make the mincemeat several weeks in advance and a couple reviewers said they did so a month ahead.  My question is this:  does the meat get preserved in all the sugar and fruit?  I worry about the meat spoiling from being in the frig that long.  Thanks for any help you can give.
1425	160	In the past, I detested mincemeat because I have only had the kind that comes in a jar. This time, I decided to try to make some from scratch, as my son and daughter-in-law asked me to for their Victorian style Christmas dinner (they are experimenting with old-fashioned meals; they no doubt thought that Mom should experiment, too). I chose this recipe because it was rated highly--I found out for good reason!
1426	160	My husband loves mincemeat pies. I cannot even stomach the thought of one, and almost gagged when I opened a store bought jar of the stuff. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I followed some other reviews and made it a month ahead of time and doubled the recipe. I made no other changes. It smelled wonderful when I would stir it weekly. I made traditional mince pies (mini pies) for Thanksgiving and only made a dozen, thinking no one but my husband would eat them. I was so wrong! They were delish! Hearty, spicy and sweet! I made another two dozen and had plenty of mincemeat left over for Christmas. I froze the rest of the mincemeat and made another two dozen for Christmas. This is now a regular recipe for us. Thanks so much for giving us a new and delicious family tradition!
1427	160	I made this pie for my parents on Thanksgiving.  They love mincemeat pie but. I one has made it since my grandma passed away!  This did not taste like hers but several times that day my dad commented how good the pie was!  It certainly is. Or a cheap pie to make but it. Was worth seeing the smiles my parents had on their faces!
1428	160	I ended up making the candied orange and lemon peelfrom scratch (other stuff full of chemicals). I saved the orange syrup and added 1/2 cup to the mincemeat mixture then reduced the white sugar to 1 scant cup. OMG so deeeelish. This pie has a wonderful full, rich flavor. I can't stop tasting it.
1429	160	I don't know much about mincemeat pie, but I do have to say this recipe was scrumptious!
1430	161	Best ham glaze I've ever had. I followed the directions as written. This one is a keeper!
1431	161	I followed recipe to the letter.  However, my ham burned.  Two hours at 400 is way too much for a 10lb ham.  In fact, my ham was closed to 11lbs. I was able to salvage the inner portion, otherwise we would not have had a thanksgiving dinner
1432	161	super delicious and moist
1433	161	I altered the recipe. Yes I did place quarter cup of water in pan..My glaze was made with mustard, vinegar, pineapple juice, brown sugar and orange marmalade. Yes marmalade. My grandmother always used vinegar and mustard to tenderize the pork. Old southern trick. I used pineapple slices and navel orange slices to cover ham.  Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Turned oven down to 350. Began using second covering of glaze.  It was delicious. My family even tasted the garnish.
1434	161	I flavour was great! I will make it again.
1435	161	Yummy. Did not alter recipe and used a picnic ham. Tender, sweet and juicy
1436	161	Instead of boiling water I used a can of ginglerale..  I followed the recipe and it was sooooo goood!!!  Will make again,,
1437	161	Best Ham I've ever made, thank you!  Moist and delicious.
1438	161	Excellent - Great Presentation
1439	162	As directed, the batter comes out thicker then a pie crust dough. I added some water since I ran out of mil and hoped for the best. I did not measure but I'd say at least a cup. Once I did that I was nervous but they turned out soo delicious. The kids love them. I absolutely love the almond flavor.
1440	162	I hope they taste good! Haven’t tried them yet!
1441	162	I bake muffins all the time and these are now at the top of my list.  The batter was quite thick, but once I added the fresh cherries, they added enough moisture. Delicious Muffins!
1442	162	I used vanilla extract instead of the almond because of an allergy and increased the milk to 1/2 cup. They were fantastic and I’ll be using the basic recipe with other fruits in the future.
1443	162	These are fantastic! The texture and taste is fabulous. I did need to add extra milk to thin out the batter, as other reviewers have mentioned. I used almond milk instead of milk, and avocado oil for the vegetable oil (just what i keep in house). i will say that i even messed up and didn't use enough cherries, because i didn't have as many as i thought i had, and the muffins are still delicious. even the loser muffins at the end that had like no cherries were good. i definitely recommend using the almond extract as the recipe recommends. can't wait to make this again with the appropriate amount of cherries! yum! oh one more thing - i doubled the recipe and got a yield of 15 muffins (i think i overfilled the muffin tin but they still turned out great).
1444	162	I will use less cherries next time, probably 3/4 cup.
1445	162	Made it vegan by using 1/4 cup applesauce instead of egg and almond milk instead of cows milk.
1446	162	Changed up a bit. Used 1/2 whole wheat pancake mix and regular flour. Added one large smashed banana. And 1 teaspoon vanilla.
1520	173	I made these and they were a HIT! I used half and half because I had some on hand. I went light on the cherry juice.Read through the comments and used Parchment Paper and I didn't have any issues with 'sticking'.
1550	176	Chef John!  Thank you so much!  Rice pudding was my father's favorite food (almost) and I'd never made it until now.  I was so happy to have it turn out so deliciously.  Thank you!
1447	162	When I started to make this recipe, I realized that the batter was the same as I use for To Die for Blueberry Muffins with streusel topping - my favorite muffin recipe. This recipe has a foolproof method of measuring the correct amount of wet ingredients which seems to be a problem for some who have tried this recipe. Add 1/3 cup oil to a liquid measuring cup. Add the egg and use a fork to break up the egg and blend the egg and oil. Fill the cup to the 1 cup line with milk and stir the liquid. Add any flavorings you like such as vanilla or almond. This method seems to provide the correct amount of wet ingredients and I have never had a bad turnout with the recipe. This version with sweet cherries was outstanding.
1448	163	Sometimes you just need something fast. I made it twice, once with canned peaches and once with frozen berries. Also, I used Splenda, instead of sugar.Cooked about 6 minutes longer with the berries to assure the batter was completely done.Great with ice cream or with whipped cream.
1449	163	I did a 1.5 recipe so it'd fit in a 13x9 pan. I used 2c of strawberries and 1c blackberries. Made as directed except I sprinkled a little sugar on the berries since they were fresh. It came out beautifully and was festive for the 4th of July! It was quick and easy too.
1450	163	Fabulous with peaches and also blueberries!!
1451	163	Easy one for vacation- put all dry ingredients in a bag, then just had to add fruit, milk (and added 1tsp vanilla like others suggested) and butter to the pan. I accidentally mixed the blueberries right into the batter, and it turned out fine. Everyone liked it and it took no time.
1452	163	Gianna why rate it when you didn’t even follow the recipe. Do the recipe and rate it….. then you could make a comment that you tried it with with tlue berries and wouldn’t suggest it. Or add your own recipe and give it s3.  That rating was unfair to the writer/cook
1453	163	Made it by using canned cherries and adding a touch of vanilla to the batter. I mixed all ingredients into the melted butter to save a bowl, and  also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top. Yum.  Reminds me of Mom’s cherry cobbler.
1454	163	So delicious! can’t wait to make it again!
1455	163	8.10.20  Got a little chewy around the edges, but that’s OK, this still was very good.  Recipe didn’t say whether or not to peel the peaches, so I didn’t.  I had some peaches to use up, threw in a few strawberries, and this was a totally simple recipe to make, almost like a dump cake.  I also think canned peaches would work well in this, as we head out of  peach season.
1456	163	This is just like my mother's peach cobbler recipe from the 1960s. It's perfect without a single change and everybody loves it.  My mother's recipe calls for 3/4 cup flour rather than 1 cup, but otherwise is identical.  I've made it with fresh peaches, fresh blueberries and canned peaches, and all are equally delicious.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream is almost essential!
1457	164	Simply the best ham glaze I have ever made.  My husband loves it  because it's not very sweet.
1458	164	Did just like the recipe but I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. It was a big hit with my whole family. I will definitely use this again.
1459	164	Wonderful and absolutely delicious glaze.  Added a pinch of ground cloves and a dash of maraschino cherry juice.  Reduced on the stove for about 10 minutes.   Used this glaze on a Hatfield boneless ham.
1460	164	my ham tasted excellent with this glaze.  not thick, just a light coating.  justnperfect for the family.
1461	164	It was quick and easy. I stuck cloves in the ham.Everyone had seconds so it was a hit.
1462	164	Excellent Glaze!  Have used several times basting the ham during cooking.  This last time I added some of the maraschino cherry juice to the mixture and everyone loved it.
1463	164	I HAD TO COOK THE GLAZE ON STOVE BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT THICKED.
1464	164	easy and delish!
1465	164	Definitely will make it again .  I put pineapple slices on to with toothpicks,  no other changes.  I used a 9 lb fully cooked smoked ham and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Was ready by 5 hours.  Delicious
1466	165	Everyone loves a bit of this on Christmas Eve!
1467	165	Great! I let this sit four months. Next time I would add more sugar. and maybe some spices.
1468	166	I just used 1 layer of cake and used Byrd's custard rather than vanilla pudding.  Next time I will forget cake layer all together. Loved it.
1469	166	Excellent!  I had lady fingers so used them instead of cake. Either will be great.
1470	166	Easy, delicious.  Used raspberry jam to top 9x12 cake and poured 1/2 c sherry over cake before slicing into 1” pieces.    Everyone raved about it.  Almost missed taking a pic as someone was digging in!
1471	166	It was a lot of work making a cake first, but well worth it.  Great reviews from my cooking club friends.  We all mostly like that it wasn't super sweet... the fresh fruit was perfect.  It would be great for a big crowd too!
1472	166	This was a huge hit at our dinner party. It wasn't too sweet and the fresh fruit made it light and delightful. Will totally be making this again and I think this will be one of my new regular dishes I bring to parties.
1473	166	Great!
1474	166	I used angel food cake instead of the white cake for a lighter dessert
1475	166	Very hard to make defining layers with this recipe. That is the key to a proper English trifle. Though the flavor isn't bad, the banana's melt far too fast. The cost to make this is not worth the expense. Sorry.
1476	166	This turned out great and looks so pretty! I followed the recipe as written and will make it again for sure. Thank you!
1477	167	I hate to be that person but I guess I thought this would be like the smoothies you get at a shop. I like creamy and not too sweet. But these were bitter and not creamy at all even after I added cream to the recipe after tasting them.
1478	167	Made it exactly as said and was good. Also tried it as a base recipe and added different fruits. Turned out great.
1479	167	I followed this generally, but would make it again!
1480	167	It came out really good! But I used plain tillamook yogert instead of the vanilla yogert and I also didn’t use cherries but I used strawberries, blueberries, and bannanas! And added ALOT of ice to it so it becomes like how I imagine smoothies to be like!
1481	167	Very tasty. I made only 1 serving of this. Using water, plain Greek yogurt,  no honey and added a scoop of Vanilla protein.
1521	173	The recipe was easy to follow, and the cookies turned out great. I actually got 23 cookies. I covered the cherries with the chocolate mixture and did not drizzle  like some of the pictures showed. I wasn't sure about baking after adding the cherry and chocolate, but they turned out as expected. Only down fall was that I had extra chocolate left over, and I had a hard time not sitting down with a spoon and eating the left over chocolate... :)
1482	167	My banana was also frozen, so there was no need to add ice. I didn'use the cherries but added frozen raspberries, 1 scoop of protein powder and used plain Greek yogurt. This came out VERY thick (blender worked extra hard), so I added additional orange juice and some milk thin it out a bit. (I'm actually eating the first serving  with a spoon right now!) Plenty sweet - no addt'l sweetener needed. It's delicious, refreshing and healthy. Will make again. UPDATE 5/9/16: Today I added a 3.5 oz bottle of vanilla Kefir probiotic to the remaining smoothie.  Yum and even healthier!
1483	167	Forgot to add the honey but didn't miss it. I used frozen raspberries instead of cherries and low fat vanilla yogurt. No ice required since all the fruit, including the banana, were already frozen.  Excellent. Perfect for hot summer afternoon.
1484	167	My husband loved this recipe, he said it was better than ice cream. I would do 1/2 of a batch for the 2 of us next time, it made quite a bit.
1485	167	Its good. I didn't add the honey
1486	168	Mixed 1/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Came out great
1487	168	The best i've had.
1488	168	Used canned pitted sour cherries (my bad), subbed tapioca flour for corn starch (5T) and added a splash of vanilla. Oooooo wheee this is GOOD! I love that this recipe calls for 1/2 cup less sugar than most others, certainly not needed.
1489	168	So easy and best cherry pie I’ve ever made. Made exactly as recipe called for!
1490	168	Great recipe!
1491	168	I will make it again. It was delicious. I used fresh cherries that tasted wonderful in the pie.
1492	168	This was by far the best cherry pie I've ever made or eaten.
1493	168	I added more cherries that it called for and yes I will make it again.
1494	169	My go to cocktail now has a go to mix. Made the recipe as is. Mandarins are small, so I sliced each one into 4 slices. Made a Bourbon OF 2:1, just perfect. Thanks for the recipe.
1495	169	This recipe is amazing. I mixed it 1:1 with Maker's Mark and a dash of bitters (did not add bitters to the mixer). My husband said it was like a party in his mouth.
1496	169	I used Turbinado sugar instead of white sugar (Sugar in the Raw).  However, I would recommend two cups of sugar instead of three.  Still use three cups water. Added a few cloves and an extra cinnamon stick.  Did the two tablespoons bitters, plus one tablespoon orange bitters.  Served OFs at Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe of this mix.
1497	169	Husband has been "collecting" whiskey and likes old fashioneds.  I almost
1498	169	This is the best old fashioned mix I have ever tasted!!! It even muddling the fruit and sugar! I am on my third batch. I did add some maple syrup and then reduced the sugar. Delicious And...yes, I am from Wisconsin!!!
1499	169	Absolutely excellent I use a 2:1 ratio:
1500	169	Fantastic flavor!  I added a lemon and used navel oranges, and a couple tablespoons molasses as another reviewer recommended brown sugar.  YUMMMMM.  So much better than store bought.
1501	169	I made this exact to the recipe and this was fantastic.  Can taste the fruit with out any muddling!
1502	169	Wonderful recipe. I used brown sugar. Taste changes with different bourbons and whiskeys. Resembles apple pie with some original Bushmills Irish Whiskey. Fantastic with Elijah Craig and other bourbons!
1503	170	I just made this using sweet cherries instead of sour. I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and I only made half of the topping. I didn’t change any ingredients or add any, either. I did use an 8x11 casserole dish to bake it in. It really turned out great.
1504	170	Made as written. Definitely too much sugar (almost turned into a hard caramel) and the crisp was double what it needed to be. The flavor was ok but I think could be improved with cinnamon or something besides sugar. Need to spray the pan ahead of time to help get everything unstuck. Was just an OK recipe.
1505	170	Used 4 cups tart Montmorency unsweetened berries from Door County, WI in an 8x8 baking dish with half the amount of topping. Perfect combination of tart & sweet.
1506	170	I omitted the shortening (so just used 1/2 C butter) and used more pie cherries. It was awesome!! Not too sweet at all. But it would be if you were using sweet cherries. But with the fresh pie cherries, it was perfect.
1507	170	I strongly dislike this recipe.  For two reasons.  One: Too much sugar, WAAAYYYY too much butter in the crumble/crisp.  It all comes out as a pan of cherry mush with mushy oatmeal on top.
1508	170	This was a super easy recipe with no eggs or milk needed. I used orchard fresh cherries and this was delicious!
1509	170	Woow put the breaks on the sugar and topping. Cut white sugar to 1/2 cup and topping in half.
1510	170	This turned out really well. I used sweet cherries so decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup. It could have ben reduced to 1/2 cup. My husband gave this recipe an A+!
1511	170	I love sour cherries for pies and crisps. This recipe was easy and did not disappoint. I used about six cups of cherries in mi e and a cup of butter, no shortening, in the topping, then tossed a few more oats on top. It was delish!
1512	171	I love Benedictine and I love Manhattans, so when I saw the Monte Carlo cocktail I had to make it! I might even like this cocktail more than a classic Manhattan. I didn’t have Peychaud’s, so I used some artisan orange and fig bitters I had on hand.
1513	172	I've been making this 40 years. For those who feel it's to sweet, if you mix cherry pie filling and a can of crushed pineapple. It is delicious! I've done many different flavors, very versatile.
1514	172	Because it is just hubby and I.  I cut the recipe in half.  I think it turned out great!  Waiting for it to cool.
1515	172	This recipe was so nostalgic, like another reviewer said. Ours ended up more like a “crumble” than a “cake” like I expected. The batter could have used more butter to add moisture to make it more like a cake. But we topped ours with some soft Breyer's vanilla ice cream and it was delightful to eat once all mixed up!
1516	172	I found it way too sweet. Made my teeth hurt.  I love sweets, but this was not what I was looking for.  Three stars because it was very easy.
1517	172	Everyone loved it.  I made it with cherry pie filling on one half and blueberry pie filling on the other half to give people a choice.
1518	172	Nice and easy.  However, it was so sweet my teeth chattered!  Accompany with unsweetened whipped cream or the least sweet vanilla ice cream.
1519	172	This brings me back to my childhood as this is a recipe my mum would make, except her recipe calls for a yellow cake mix. Regardless, this is an easy dessert and is effortless to make.
1522	173	Worked beautifully! If you're just doing a chocolate drizzle, you can reduce the amount of milk/chips.
1523	173	My 11-year-old grandson doesn't like the chunks of cherry, so I pureed and strained them (after having pitted an equivalent amount of fresh cherries), then mixed them into about half of the frosting part of the recipe, treating that part as if it were the cherry. These cookies were SO perfect when first made, but I was worried they'd become hard and crunchy after being refrigerated overnight. Happily, they were just as mouth-watering. Thank you for a unique treat!
1524	173	We make this recipe every year for Christmas. Originally I always make as written, but eventually made a few changes. Sometimes we cut the cherries in half (if they are larger or we think we might not have enough). If we run out of cherries we just make some without. Everyone in my house (and some family who was here when I made them) agreed that the frosting was too sweet and eventually we decided to omit it completely. (And it does make WAY too much frosting!) We either just exclude the topping entirely or drizzle the cookies with melted chocolate. I've done both a dark chocolate and white chocolate drizzle and both were great. Without the frosting this is a 5 star recipe.
1525	173	These are Fantastic!!!!!!! WOW
1526	173	WONDERFUL!  These cookies are loved by all!  Instead of using maraschino cherries, I picked out cherries from a can of cherry pie filling and did not use the chocolate drizzle!  I've made these several times at requests!  Delicious!
1527	173	This was absolutely delicious.  I used four eggs instead of two and boiled the frosting base for only one minute and poured the frosting onto the cake before the chocolate chips completely melted. The next day is was moister. I will definitely make again and serve it on the second day.  Delicious!!
1528	173	YES. These are absolutely perfect. The only thing I would say would be to cut the chocolate drizzle in half. It made WAY too much. Other than that, I would make these every day if I could!
1529	174	It's so good! I always make it for thanksgiving and everyone loves it, although if you don't like the cherries falling out of your pie as you eat it I recommend mixing a packet of gelatin with about 1/2 or 1 cup of water and mixing it in, I find that it helps keep the cherries together quite nicely and tastes delicious. I also mix softened butter w/ a bit of brown sugar and spread it on the top crust for a nice brown and crispy crust. If you like raspberries you can switch the cherries for raspberries its really good.
1530	174	I've used this sort of recipe before for berry pies. I skipped the extracts. And I would definitely use 7 cups of cherries instead of 4 for a fuller pie.
1531	174	Not sure about the almond extract.  However,  it's still in the oven.
1532	174	First time ever making a cherry pie- and have to say it was easier than I thought it would be. Especially pitting the cherries- I chilled them in ice water for about 15 minutes before, and used a straw to push out the pit from top through bottom. I did this the evening before I made the pie, so the hard work was over. I followed recipe and even latticed the top. Hardest part for me was keeping my son from eating it before it completely cooled!
1533	174	Excellent pie huge hit went with 1.25 cups of sugar and margarine on top of the lattice crust we are non dairy. Will make again while cherries are in season may freeze some too.
1534	174	Followed recipe precisely, but filling was way too sugary sweet. It may have been OK if made with sour/tart cherries but cherry type was not indicated and I used regular sweet/eating cherries.
1535	174	Followed recipe precisely, but filling was way too sugary sweet. It may have been OK if made with sour/tart cherries but cherry type was not indicated and I used regular sweet/eating cherries.
1536	174	Easy instructions, taste was great (I didn’t have almond extract, so skipped that) but mine didn’t set up for some reason. My cherries were from frozen. If I make it again I will add some flour or corn starch and see how that goes.
1537	174	Excellent recipe! First homemade cherry pie I’ve ever had or made.  The texture was perfect like over reviews stated, and sliced wonderful.  Nothing was said about the size of the cherries so I left mine almost whole minus the pit and i could have cut them in quarters and liked it a bit more (personal preference). I also doubled the extracts.  Will definitely make again for family.
1538	175	Wonderful! Soaked cherries with 1T Hennessy. Used two whole eggs, and walnuts. Added to the recipe book!
1539	175	Didn't have veg oil, used evoo store brand, and used 2 (3.4oz ea)probiotic dailies instead of 8oz yogurt used 2 whole eggs. Came out very good!
1540	175	OMG so easy and delish!  I used plain yogurt and tsp. Vanilla, plus two whole eggs.  Yummy
1541	175	This cake was excellent. The only change I made was to substitute the pecans in the topping with sliced almonds. The cake was moist with tons of cherry flavor which surprised me since it only called for 1/2 cup of the cherries.
1542	175	This recipe was amazing! However, I adjusted a few things:
1543	175	We enjoyed this delicious coffee cake, which is a little different from the usual coffee cake I make because of the lack of cinnamon, which makes a nice change of pace from our usual coffee cake.  It had wonderful flavor and texture and has the ideal amount of sweetness.  If you’re looking for a perfect accompaniment to your morning cup of coffee, I highly recommend this recipe.
1544	175	What a wonderful coffeecake recipe. Tender and moist crumb.  Quick and easy to make. Like other reviewers, I used two whole eggs, instead of the egg plus egg white called for in the recipe. I also added a struesel topping to elevate the pecan/sugar topping. Delicious recipe.
1545	175	This was actually much better than I anticipated.  It took longer to cook than suggested but other than that the recipe was good.  It's a tender moist cake that's not overly sweet and the cherries were not chewy but soft like fresh.  Overall this is a tasty cake.
1546	175	7.3.20  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of cutting back a little on the sugar (personal taste preference).  This was extremely easy to make and turned out pretty well.  I baked it in a 9” springform pan and was just a little disappointed that it didn’t rise more.  If I were to make this again, I’d bake in an 8” springform pan and then be prepared to cook longer.  It is plenty moist and tender, the cherries give you a nice pop of sweetness, and they were distributed evenly throughout the cake.
1547	176	This was delicious, so creamy and yummy. I did add a bit more sugar, and I added cardamom powder to mine as well. Oh, and I also used half coconut milk and half regular milk. Very easy to make and we all loved it so much that I’m going to be making more tomorrow ! And of course listening to Chef John is always entertaining!
1548	176	So, so creamy.  Loved it. Doubled the recipe. I used maple sugar instead of white and added Joyajian's maple flavor.  (We love maple.) Also used oat milk since we are dairy sensitive.  Great tip on stirring up the starch. Forgot the butter but didn't seem to matter (except for my waistline.)
6942	877	Easy to make very tasty this is a keeper
1552	176	I made it the way the recipe states. I just didn’t use cherry’s.
1553	176	I think it was good but i would add less salt.
1554	176	It’s a pure delight, creamy dessert that I can’t wait for my family to enjoy.
1555	176	This is, HANDS DOWN, the best Rice Pudding recipe I have made. Thanks Chef!
1556	177	I made this last year.  I didn't have powdered pectin, only liquid.  At first it was like a heavy cherry syrup which was cool because it would be good as a garnish on pancakes, French toast, ice cream n such.I went to get a jar out of the cellar a few months later and to my surprise it had formed up into jam!  I'm certain the pectin was the issue.I'm making this again today, this time using the powdered pectin per the recipe.  It was a HUGE hit at home and at work.  I'll be doing at least three batches. One to keep, two to sell or barter.
1557	177	Very simple and good recipe!
1558	177	Ok, a few things...I added a tsp of almond extract...Fabulous!  And for those who are having "syrupy" and an otherwise difficult time...here's some probable issues...#1 The recipe calls for 2 (2 ounce) packages of Sure Jell...look at the packaging...Sure jell is now 1.75 ounces...That makes a HUGE difference in the recipe.  Instead of using 4 ounces, if you use 2 packages you are only using  3.5 ounces.  #2  The directions ask for 3 cups pitted, chopped fresh cherries...I use a kitchen scale, so when you pit the cherries they will weigh less.  3 cups of pitted Bing cherries is 675 grams...you may be measuring with the pits IN...the directions want the measurement of already pitted cherries.  Pit then measure...If you don't have one, do yourself a BIG favor...get yourself a scale that measures grams and ounces and then some...it makes it much easier in figuring out recipes...  I learned this from bread baking...weights do make a difference in accuracy...Hope this helps...
1559	177	I really liked this recipe! Cooked up very well and preserved nicely. I like that the sugar doesn't outweigh the amount of cherries! It lets the cherry flavor shine. You could use less pectin, maybe 1 or 1.5 packets.
1560	177	Added some vanilla extract, may go a little less on sugar next time. Overall, very good and the cherry taste is powerful. Tried another recipe with another batch, and this one was better!
1561	177	Good flavor, but very runny despite boiling to temperature!
1562	177	Made this jam tonight and while it set beautifully it yielded only five cups of jam
1563	177	I used a food processor to chop. Will make it again for sure.
1564	177	Followed recipe exactly...ended up with cherry syrup not jam!
1565	178	Very good.  I doubled the cherries and apples and increased the mayo to 1/2 cup.
1566	178	If you have chicken ready this is really easy and very tasty.  I like the milk to thin out the Mayo.  I’ll do that now for other recipes.  Reduces the calories and the dressing goes further.
1567	178	Delicious! This dish reminds me of a great restaurant in Charlevoix where I first had chicken salad with cherries. I added about tablespoon of finely diced red onion. Can’t wait to make this again.
1568	178	This recipe for the Cherry Chicken Salad is delicious and I will make it again.  I even shared some of it with one of my friends who also loved it.
1569	178	This tasted amazing!!
1570	178	I didn't have cherries, or pecans (used almonds I toasted in oven) and I added some carrot shreds to give a little color.
1571	178	I love this chicken salad!  I discovered it a couple years ago in a Taste of Home cookbook. For those saying it's too dry, the recipe I have calls for 1/2 cup mayo and 4 teaspoons buttermilk. My husband eats in on bread, which has more mayo on it.
1572	178	wow this was so yummy! Although I did make a few changes. I used 1/3 cup  pineapple tidbits instead of apples and added a teaspoon of dried chives  and a few tablespoons more of mayonnaise with about 3 tablespoons of Marzetti's poppyseed dressing and didn't add buttermilk and also added about 1 teaspoon lemon pepper and then followed the recipe as written and served it on toast with lettuce.
1573	178	Have made this twice.  First time we used cherries as instructed.  This option proved to increase the cost of the recipe significantly.  The second time I used cranberries and found it just as tasty.  Best part, much much cheaper!  Love this recipe for daily lunches.
1574	179	So easy that the next day I used the recipe for peach clafoutis which was also delicious. The ratio of eggs and cream was perfect for a nice creamy custard.  I make my own vanilla extract so I used that instead of the bean. Then, I used the same recipe minus the sugar and vanilla and made a savory clafoutis containing sauteed mushrooms, red bell pepper, soft goat cheese - Chevre, onion, zucchini, and an assortment of my favorite spices.The Blend-Tec food processor made the filling so easy.
1575	179	I added apples because I was limited on cherries.
1576	179	Lovely classic recipe that I grew up with in Poitiers. Any ripe fruit can be substituted in this recipe. The classic variation is to omit vanilla and instead add a 1/4-1/2 tsp of almond extract to the batter. Almonds and cherries are a match made in Heaven.
1577	179	I made this exactly as written EXCEPT that I used vanilla extract because I did not have a vanilla bean, and I whisked it by hand.  Of the three Clofouti recipes I have used, this is now my favorite!
1578	179	I tried this recipe twice and it came out a liquidy mess both times. I made it in two different ovens and with a different fruit each time and it was unappetizing on both occasions. This is after baking it for far longer than the recipe called for and it still was not edible
1579	179	Delicious! A great way to use the cherries that have been in my freezer for a long time. I have never made a clafoutis before, but it was really easy and tastes like baked custard.
1580	179	I love this recipe, I’ve made other clafoutis and was not happy with them. I used sour cherries, and replaced the vanilla bean with vanilla extract, and added more sugar. Fantastic, it puffed up and browned beautifully.
1581	179	I didn't have vanilla beans so added extract instead. It took about fifteen minutes longer than the recipe stated before the middle didn't look jiggly. So tasty! I tried a different recipe last month and it was too rubbery. This one was perfect. Thank you for sharing!
1582	179	I used vanilla extract and some butter instead of the cream.  I also used gluten-free all-purpose flour.  It turned out great!  Really easy, delicious, and not too sweet.
1583	180	A great cake thats not too laden with sugarEasy to make and fabulous with a mug if teaStore it in the fridge
1584	180	I think the texture was off .
1585	180	Was okay.  A bit dry.  Used extra large eggs.  Instead of olive oil on top, I topped it with Demerara sugar.  Used 4 cups frozen cherries.  it needs 4 cups.
1736	197	The recipe is good. I tried exactly what was given and made a very good brownie.
1586	180	Please!, do NOT use olive oil. Use unsalted butter, or vegetable oil but never olive oil. Definitely add more yogurt. In my case, I added a bit sour cream and whipping cream. I did not caramelize the cherries. I added them in the batter and when I poured the mixture in pan I put more cherries on top, sprinkled sugar and poured melted butter over it. Tasted way better this way
1587	180	I made it. It was yummy. Only the colour got darker. I think the reason was baked cherries.
1588	180	this cake is very delicious, but i have made some changes, first i added 1 cup of cherries on the top of the cake and second i added 1/2 cup of ground almonds and reduced the flour to 2 cups,
1589	180	I made half this recipe in an 8" square pan. I weighed the flour out, stirred the ingredients together just until combined and made extra sure to not overbake. My cake baked in 21 minutes. It's dry and I'm really disappointed. I used vegetable oil in place of olive and added salt, but needed more.
1590	180	We really like this cake.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain because the only plain I could find was a large quantity.  Next time I think I will use black cherry yogurt.  I also used about 2 1/2 cups of cherries.  Next time I will use at least 3 cups.  Very good recipe!
1591	180	Please don't call it Polish! Polish pastry is fantastic but this cake is not. I followed the recipe to the point and the cake looks good but the taste not so. It is very dense and kind of tasteless.
1592	181	I’ve used this recipe several times and love how the cookies turn out.  It’s just like my mother made.  I have made it with a regular hand mixer and also used a food processor.  Honestly, I prefer it in the food processor because the dates and other ingredients are more finely chopped and blended together.
1593	181	I chill the dough and then it rolls nicely
1594	181	My husband and his family love these and I just can't figure out why.  It's way too much work involved, so hubby makes them every year for the past 30 yrs.    They are just tasteless to me.
1595	181	These were my favorite cookie 55 yrs ago. My mom send them to me while I was in the army.  She got the recipe from the back of a Kellogs cereal box.  Been  looking for this recipe for years.  I added small bits of pineapple to a few of cookies when I baked them. YUM YUM
1596	181	This is a super old recipe that I believe was originally on the Kellogg corn flakes box. I'm in my 60's and my mom made them every year at Christmas and I've kept up the tradition. My mom never rolled them in the cornflakes though so I've never had them that way and they taste and look great just plain. They work well as a drop cookie and it is a little simpler to make. It is important to add the cherry on top to get that festive look. Oh, and I do substitute butter for shortening.
1597	181	They turned out really well.  Next time I will make them smaller.
1598	181	I found the dough to be too sticky as well, I added about 1/4 more flour and refrigerated for about an hour.   they still spread out  quite a bit.  Next time I make I think I will use less butter.  They were delicious though even with the extra flour.
1599	181	A true favorite in my home. Don't be scared off by the dates . They almost go unnoticed when you eat the cookie.
1600	181	A classic recipe that originally was posted on the back of a Kellogg's Corn Flakes box, years ago.  It is one of my personal favorites for Christmas time, which I have made for years.  It's not a super economical cookie, but its a great gift and they always disappear.
1601	182	Absolutely delicious- a permanent addition to our ham dishes.
1602	182	We do not have ham without this sauce.  Really easy and a breeze to clean up.  I usually prepare it before putting the ham in the oven, bring to a boil and allow to cool down on the stove.  Then heat it up just before taking the ham out of the oven.  The flavors seem to blend better this way.
1603	182	I used apple cider vinegar instead of white and honey instead of corn syrup. I also, almost tripled the spices. I couldn't find my cloves so I ended up using allspice and a half teaspoon of cardamom. Definitely making again.
1604	182	Awesome added a honey crisp apple after it is simmered
1605	182	I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this, it was one of my students recipe choices. Thanks for sharing.
1606	182	I didn’t have white vinegar on hand so substituted red wine instead. Delicious!
1607	182	Cherries are my favorite fruit preserves are even better.  So when I saw this glaze I had to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I would do as one reviewer said and reduce the vinegar by half next time.  For me, it was too prominent.  Also, I will simmer it a little longer to thicken it a bit.  Overall an excellent recipe that I will definitely be making again.
1608	182	An excellent glaze. Made this to bring to my son's and everyone raved. I would never have thought of cherries but will use this glaze again.  The ham was moist and tender - lovely flavour to it.  Added a touch of grenadine to the sauce near the end. WOW!
1609	182	It actually makes an even better sauce than a glaze, especially if you're drinking red wine!
1610	183	My mother used to make this only using graham crackers.  I didn’t care for them but the rest was good.  I started hunting for a recipe and found this one.  I made it; however, after reading a number of comments about it turning out sticky, I decided to skip the coconut milk.  It turned out pretty dry but I packed it 2 loaf pans and refrigerated them. When I tried cutting one, it was pretty crumbly.  After thinking about it for a while, I decided since it wasn’t cooked, I could “deloaf” it back into a large mixing bowl and added 1/2 the can of coconut milk.  I blended it and kept turning it so all would be moistened.  I also added a small tub of candied orange peel.  I packed and mashed it all back into the loaf pans and have refrigerated it.  I think the instructions should be changed to 1/2 cup of coconut milk.  An optional amount of candied orange peel would be a nice added touch!
1611	183	I added pineapple to mine.
1612	183	Haven’t cut it to actually taste...but the flavor is definitely there from the sample I tasted.  I cut my cherries more into quarters.  Used 1 can of coconut condensed milk.  No actual coconut milk.  I used maraschino cherry juice in place of the coconut milk.  I molded mine into a bundt pan which I sprayed with coconut oil spray.  Fingers crossed it slides out in one piece.
1613	183	I don’t like baked fruitcake at all.  But My family has made these refrigerator cakes since I was a girl.  We don’t use coconut milk or coconut flakes and we add a little rum.   Other than that the recipe is the same.  We make it a couple of weeks ahead so it can age.    It’s so good, more like candy than a cake.
1614	183	I don’t like fruitcake. However, this fruitcake tastes really good! It’s not your traditional fruitcake, but the changes make it absolutely enjoyable! Unfortunately, it didn’t set up very well. That’s ok! Spoon it into a bowl or over vanilla ice cream and enjoy!
1615	183	Omitting the coconut milk will solve the 'too soft to cut' issue and the fresh/frozen coconut provide ample coconut flavor.  My Grandmother and aunts made this cake annually for Christmas, packing the cake in small narrow boxes lined with foil to reserve moistness.  Slicing thinly is imperative as it is rich and makes the cake last longer if you can stay out of it, lol.
1616	183	I liked this recipe because it was easy and fun to make!
1617	183	Very quick, easy, and great tasting recipe!  It's a little gooey, so instead of forming it into a lof or in a pan, I would recommend putting it in individual dishes for serving, then mayber top with a little whipped cream.
1618	183	I must give this recipe 5 starts for its wonderful taste. However, it sure comes out looking as something other than a loaf of fruitcake: it's gooey, and that aspect may turn some people off (like it did my husband). I think I'll try adding some more crushed Nilla wafers to it to try and firm it up more. Again, as to the taste, one can't stop eating.
1619	184	Too much cream leaving a dreadful mouthfeel layer of fat on my palate.. Skipped the liqueur.  Next time I'll use one Tblspn corn starch, glucose (no sugar) 150ml cream (whipped to soft peak) and 600ml also 6 eggs making an Anglaise.
1620	184	Awesome recipe.  Took previous reviewers advice and cut the almond extract down to 1/8 tsp.  Was perfect!
1621	184	Delicious! I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still good. Tastes just like store bought ice cream
1622	184	I tried this recipe since I love vanilla cherry ice cream.  It is easy to make and tastes great!  This will definitely get made again.
1623	184	This recipe was perfect! It was so simple that it seemed too good to be true, but it came out creamy and delicious. It was really sweet so I may reduce the sugar a bit next time. I may try putting chocolate chunks in, too.
1624	184	LOVED IT!! I was having some guests coming over for dinner and wanted to whip up a dessert and found this. At first I wasn't so sure about making my own ice cream but then when I finally finished it, it was a great result. I would definitely   make this again if guests are coming over or just for my family. I would definitely keep some extra cherries and keep more than one or two of them on the top.
1625	184	Used canned cherries. Put in a little juice to add color. Everyone loves it.  Great flavor and creamy.
1626	184	What a wonderful flavor! I quartered  cherries so that they would be present in more bites. Loved the almond flavoring!  I used 1% for the milk and it  was a great, light texture.
1627	184	Ok. I have to be honest. I used this recipe and have used this as a base for so many other ice creams!!
1628	185	Yummy & incredibly easy. Other pie filling flavors are also delicious. I use 2 cans pie filling & bake it a bit longer. Coconut & nuts are optional & not at all necessary.
1629	185	My family loved it!
1630	185	I made this, and modified by using 2 21 oz apple caramel pie filling instead of pineapple. I sprinkled 2 c chopped walnuts over pie filling. I used a spice cake mix and with a pastry blender I blended 2 sticks of butter into the cake mix and then put on top of the filling. Baking at 350 for 50 minutes. Everybody liked it, there were no leftovers!
1631	185	I NEVER use melted butter, i put the sticks of butter (in small cubes) all over the top; not melted. and it works perfectly. I've been making this for over 10 yrs - it is very versatile - change cherry for blue berry, peach or your favorite canned pie filling.
1632	185	My cake mix was only 15 oz but I added 3 oz of flour to make up the difference. I also use butter instead of margarine and sprinkle some cinnamon on top of the dry cake mix before adding the butter, coconut, and nuts. It just adds another subtle flavor dimension. I also used pineapple tidbits instead of crushed since that's all the store had at the time. due to our love of pineapple I'm sure it will be delicious. I would love to include a picture but it looks the same as the title picture and my phone keeps freezing when I try to do it. It smells so good in here I have to sit on my hands for the next few hours until it's cool enough to attack without getting lava burn. Not that there's anything wrong with that! ?? Enjoy
1633	185	I made it without the coconut because I didn't have any and it turned out great! I used strawberry pie filling but any fruit pie filling would taste wonderful!
1634	185	Spectacular!  And easy, peasy, lemon squeezy!!!!  The crust with coconut and nuts in delish.  However, it is on the sweet side with the cherry pie filling and the pineapple (in 100% juice).  I also may add the coconut and nuts the last 10 minutes to prevent overcooking them.
1635	185	This was so easy to make and so delicious!!  I did tweak it based on my liking - I used butter in place of the margarine and I only used a 3/4 box of yellow cake mix.  It may not have made any difference, but I used the Betty Crocker Yellow Cake Mix.
1636	185	I halved the recipe, skipped the pineapple and added whatever fresh fruit I had on hand. Served with vanilla ice cream. Delicious and super easy. It is versatile and can be used with apples, peaches, blueberries or cherries. It is great way to get rid of unused fruit.
1637	186	I love this recipe!  I am from central Florida and this recipe was given to me by my grandmother. So delicious and nostalgic.
1638	186	My family loves this icebox fruit cake. My grandmother used to make one every Christmas in the 60's and early 70's and now my mother carries on the tradition. It is easy to make, but we leave out the walnuts and we use vanilla wafers instead of gram crackers and keep it in the freezer and nibble on it as long as it last. Delicious!!!!
1639	186	Definitely mini marshmallows sound awesome!
1640	186	My grandma was from GA and made this for my birthday every year. Instead of vanilla wafers she used graham cracker crumbs. Everyone loved it. It’s just very dense and sweet!!
1641	186	Made this in high school home economics class. I thought this was a clever idea.
1642	186	OMG! My mom used to make this every Christmas! This stuff is awesome. One year she couldn't find vanilla wafers and used Graham crackers and it was delicious, now my entire family makes both versions (Just another reason to gain 30 lbs during Christmas  lol)
1643	186	I added coconut to mine much better
1644	186	My aunt Patricia died without sharing this recipe with anyone!!! After I read the reviews, I am convinced it was how she did it.... She also used graham crackers candied fruit in the little clear plastic cartons with the green cherries and pinapple in it and added a little cinnamon and allspice because you could taste it. She would line loaf pans with wax paper and not use a bundt pan. It wasn't Christmas without one.  I think this is a southern dish too... my inlaws and outlaws from up north never have seen or heard of it.
1704	194	Perfect recipe, easy to make almost  sugar free/lite with SF jello, Coke Zero, and fat free cream cheese. Cuts calories quite a bit.
1645	186	As many have said, Graham crackers are an option in place of the vanilla wafers.  I also add coconut, and just pecans (no walnuts).  It has gotten great reviews so far.  I just finished a double-batch today, and have placed in in the "ice box" using the wax paper and graham cracker boxes. I'll bring it out on Christmas Day! On a side note, I didn't use the whole box of crackers for the recipe, but a bit more than 2/3 of it. I'm thinking this will add a bit more moistness. This second batch I also added a dash of cherry juice from the jar! My Dad said it was just like Mama's - a definite compliment!
1646	187	I made this fruitcake today, and it has a very nice light taste to it.  It is full of fruit, and my husband is going to gobble it up. I did find that it only needed to bake for 1 hour and 50 minutes. My oven appears to run a bit warm, so I am glad that I was checking on it early.
1647	187	Absolutely delicious!  Moist, and a little lighter tasting than traditional fruitcake, and exploding with fruit!  Followed recipe except used 2.5C golden raisins, 1C dried cherries, 1C homemade candied lemon peel, grated orange rind of 3 oranges,  and did not brush with butter on top after baking.  Flavours and results were worth all the fruit used.  Will definitely make this again soon because after leaving the cake to cool overnight there was only 1/3 of the cake left by after breakfast before I even got to taste it!
1648	187	Yumm! I varied the fruit, and it’s delicious.  Will make again.
1649	187	I have made this cake now twice ! my husband I love it
1650	187	I have made this cake for 15 years, I use Malibu coconut rum in it and on it . This cake has never failed to please and is easy  peasy to make .
1651	187	I have made this cake for 15 years, I use Malibu coconut rum in it and on it . This cake has never failed to please and is easy  peasy to make .
1652	187	I have made this recipe for 30 yrs but only use 1 cup raisins, 2 cups candied fruit, 1/2 cup red candied cherries and 1/2 cup green candied cherries. I also put all the fruit in a bowl and cover with crushed pineapple, then cover and let stand overnight. Next morning mix other ingredients and fold into fruit mixture. I like baking in smaller pans so I can share with friends.
1653	187	I have been making this cake as a Christmas cake for about 5 years. It is moist and tasty and I ice it as a traditional festive cake. Like other reviewers, I adapt the recipe altering the fruit to a smaller quantity, adding some flaked almonds and pouring a little brandy over the cooked cake. I've had trouble getting some crushed pineapple this year but made my own out of blending pineapple rings lightly.
1654	187	Moist, easy, delicious!
1655	188	This recipe is great as it is written. Since I like to make some substitutions....  the second time I swapped Ferma chocolate butter for regular, added ginger powder and a mix of diced candied ginger and cocoa nibs. Yum.
1656	188	Our family loves this one and we make it often, but bake time is way off. Have made in different Bundt pans and about 55-60 minuites is hgood. 80 results in very dry crusty cake.Extra cherries and glaze put this over the top!
1657	188	made this twice now, very good cherry pound cake
1658	188	I followed the recipe exactly except I used chopped firm fresh strawberries since I didn't have any cherries.  Used a loaf pan and cooked the full 80 minutes.  It was excellent. Will definitely make it again and always use the strawberries.
1659	188	I have been looking everywhere for this recipe, when I was little my mother made this every year for Christmas. the only differences were that she added fresh pecans along with the cherries, (my Grandfather would send them from Texas), and we dusted them with powdered sugar. She used to bake them in old coffee tins, so they would be straight and tall. We wrapped them in cellophane with ribbons. My only advice butter those tins well if you try it this way. They are beautiful and everyone loved them as gifts. Thanks for posting this!
1660	188	This is a delicious cake! I have made it once and now I have made it again. It was delicious the first time and I had requests to do it again.
1661	188	My new favorite cake! Made just as written. One reviewer wrote that it’s better the next day and I agree. Pair with a scoop of vanilla ice cream = divine! Thanks for sharing!
1662	188	Delicious
1663	188	Absolutely amazing. My family loved it.
1664	189	I never make changes the first time I make something.  This was so good and reminded me of when I was a kid so I think its a keeper just as is!  Thank you.
1665	189	very good!  I used Rum instead of Sherry.
1666	189	Made this for my mother since she enjoys this type of dessert. Turned out pretty well. Omitted the green cherries and doubled the amount of red ones. Nice garnished with raisins too.
1667	190	Filling needed more flour. I used 3 tablespoons with the brown sugar.
1668	190	YUM!
1669	190	We made this with the ground cherries we grew in our garden and had frozen.  A definite keeper...it tastes something like a caramel apple pie.
1670	190	I cut the sugar by a third. It was wonderful and you could really taste the Ground Cherries.
1671	190	Used 4 cups ground cherries. Turned out great, just like moms when I was a kid. Will absolutely be making this again. Thanks
1672	190	I made this pie yesterday and it was tasty but a little bit too sweet and runny so will decrease the sugar and increase the flour.
1673	190	got a couple of pints of ground cherries from my CSA and didn't know what to do with them.  this recipe was enjoyed by the whole family.  really delicious -- reminds me of a peach cobbler almost and it was very easy. i did follow another reviewer's advice and cut the brown sugar to 1/3 of a cup and it was perfect!  Will definitely make again if I get some more ground cherries.  thank you for sharing this recipe!
1674	190	Good.  I like them better in a pie than fresh.  Easy pie.
1675	190	WAY TOO SWEET! Got the ground cherries at the farmers market, they are delicious. I wanted a traditional recipe but the fruit is too sweet on its own for the amount of sugar in the recipe. I'll get more ground cherries if they have them next week but only for snacking.
1676	191	I'm sorry but I found these to be tasteless.  I also added molasses and an extra egg to help with how dry it was.  I don't think I missed anything.  Reread the recipe to make sure I followed it perfectly.  Maybe alter it to your own liking.  I like how they were sugar free though.
1677	191	They look beautiful! I used honey instead of maple syrup, and added some slivered almonds just because I could.
1678	191	First time I made them I added some non-sweetened coconut and replaced extract with 1tsp vanilla and 2tsp almond extract. They were a huge hit at the party!
1705	194	My husband loves this salad so much, we have it for dessert instead of with dinner.
6943	877	We enjoyed the recipe, the chops we used were poor quality..
1679	191	Dang these are delicious! I can't make any recipe without messing with it just a bit so I subbed 1/2 cup of golden flax flour and since I'm not really watching calories or sugar I added a touch more maple syrup. Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb.
1680	191	was nice and quick to do given you have the ingredients. I searched for almond flour dates recipes... this was very intriguing and tastes amazing given no added sugar
1681	191	They tasted good but were quite crumbly. I might try puréed dates next time.
1682	191	I was looking for a simple date cookie recipe that didn't include sugar... and though I don't need gluten-free nor paleo, this cookie turned out amazingly! I followed the baking instructions exactly and the cookies were slightly crispy on the bottom/edges and perfectly flaky (not too dry) in the middle. For the recipe, I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I omitted the cherries, walnuts, maple syrup, vanilla... it was still perfect! I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe!
1683	191	These were delicious. I didn’t have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them! Great recipe to use as a base for other flavors.
1684	191	Followed the recipe as written. These turned out very moist and delicious! I brought them to work and my coworkers raved over them and asked for the recipe.
1685	192	I didn't have a bundt pan or funnel pan, so I baked it in 2 loaf pans.  This is a dense cake, however I added a scoop of sour cream to keep it from being dry.  I always add sour cream to a baked item when someone's review says it was dry.  I made a cream cheese spread to put on individual slices.
1686	192	Another delicious keeper for me. I followed the baker who used less flour and more sugar, and I poured some of the cherry juice in too. I used Marischino 🍒 cherries. I don’t have an angel food pan, so I used a Bundt pan. I also drizzled the top with some white vanilla icing. Next time I’d use more pecans and more cherries. All in all, a very flavorful pound cake with good texture that actually tasted better the next day. Crispy on the outside, perfectly smooth on the inside. Also great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Thanks for sharing!
1687	192	I just added a can of thick cream to this mixture and it was perfect….yummy
1688	192	You can use 1/4 cup less of the sugar and it is still sweet when you add Cherry frosting over it. Yummy!
1689	192	My family loved it! Took the advice from other viewers and added more sugar and less flour. Used dried fig because I didn't have cherries, and just sifted some powdered sugar on top.  Will definitely be making this again.
1690	192	Could I just give this ten stars??  I made my cake very close to the original (but I did substitute maraschino cherries, as an option that the author suggested & I used 2 small jars of cherries, well-drained & halved).  I used almost the same measurements for sugar & flour as in the original, but in order to add some extra sweetness (as other reviewers had recommended) I chose to add approx. 1 - 1½ cups of white chocolate chips to the cherry/flour mixture, coating all well before I added them to the batter.  You'd never guess the white chips were in there, yet they add an extra level of yumminess to this already delightful cake.  To take it "over the top", I added a drizzle of melted white chocolate (with just a tad of veg. shortening) & thinned with cherry juice.  My chocolate-loving husband gave this an enthusiastic thumbs-up & said it would be even BETTER than cookies at Christmas time.
1691	192	It looked delicious! Taste was good, however too dry. I always make a recipe the way it is written the first time I try it. I would definitely make some of the adjustments in some of the other reviews in the future.
1692	192	II made two changes. I divided this into two loaf pans because my husband wanted loaf pans size and I baked it for 50 miinutes. It was moist and delious
1693	192	I made the adjustments suggested by naples. I made them into cupcakes, baking for 22 mins. They turned out good. I coated the  cups with ground almonds at first but decided that for cupcakes they were too crumby and used paper liners instead. I also cut the cherries into quarters.  They were moist and rich, I would make these again.
1694	193	Followed previous advice & used butter Crisco and 11/2 tsp of almond extract in cake batter..baked in 9x13 pan for 30-35 minutes. The big change was the frosting. Used half the powdered sugar. Can’t imagine how cloyingly sweet it would have been following the recipe as written. Instead of adding food coloring to frosting used very small amount of cherry juice & got a nice soft pink color.
1695	193	This cake was so good.  I made sure I sifted the dry ingredients 3 times I also omitted the nuts just because I don't like them. lol I did add a teaspoons of almond extract and I used butter flavored crisco. Cake was moist and light. I used a buttercream
1696	193	I didn't care for it but come to find out, my baking powder was outdated which is most likely the reason it didn't rise properly.
1697	193	I have been making this  cake for many years but never use pecans, I always use black walnut pieces.  I have a few other changes that I do to make it more moist and lighter however, don't want to bore anyone with this information.
1698	193	My Maraschino Cherry cake came out very dry & crumbly.
1699	193	I followed this recipe to the tee and there are some flaws with it. First, there is no way you can get 2 9in pans worth of cake out of that batter.  If you try, the cook time won't be right.  30 min will make the cake tuff on the outside.  Second, there wasn't enough cherries.  There were some pieces of cake that didn't have ANY cherries in it!!!! I'm going to give it another try(with alterations) before I kick this recipe to the curb!
1700	193	The cake was very heavy.  My family of five didn't care for it. I wouldn't make this cake again,
1701	193	This cake was just alright.  Not quite as light as I had expected, but my toddlers gobbled it up just the same.  Next time, I'll make it without frosting - it adds way too much sweetness to an already sweet cake.
1702	193	This recipe is excellent.  It presents beautifully.  I did alter the frosting just a tad.  Instead of the food coloring, I used the cherry juice and some very finely diced marashino cherries.  It gave the frosting a very nice pink tint and the little chunks of cherry gave the frosting a little variety in texture.  I also made this recipe into cupcakes and you do have to be careful not to overbake it.  It can dry out.  All in all, this is as close to my grandmothers recipe that I have found.
1703	194	I read through several of the reviews to make modifications - especially Jan's.  My entire family loved it! We put it in the freezer to make it a frozen salad.
1706	194	I read the reviews and made this based on the advice given. I heated the cherry and pineapple juice with the jello added then poured in the coke. I put this mixture in the frig for 30 min then added the fruit, nuts and "cubed" cream cheese...stirred and let sit overnite. When ready to serve I set the mold in a sink of warm water for a few minutes...this loosened it from the edges  which allowed me to successfully flip it over for a beautifully ,delicious, molded salad! Received tons of compliments on the taste as well as the beauty.
1707	194	My grandmother made this for every holiday. I make it for my family now. We love it!
1708	194	I don't know if I will make this again. Everything was fine until I added the (cut up) cream cheese. It was downhill from there. I used electric beaters to "fluff" the jello and cream cheese, etc.and it didn't happen. I wound up with white speckled jello. Maybe I should have spent more time fluffing the jello up. Maybe the cream cheese should be at room temperature. I think more precise instructions are needed for this recipe.
1709	194	A favorite with my husband.  Have made many times over the years usually at holidays.  The cream cheese does melt into the hot jello giving it a creamy look and smooth taste...
1710	194	We have used a recipe like this in my family since the 50s. This is the closest thing I could find.  We always use black cherry jello and we do not blend in the cream cheese .  We cube the cream cheese and add it as well as the other ingredients to the jello mixture when it is syrupy. This keeps the it evenly distributed throughout the salad.  There is an art to the cream cheese. It helps to have it almost frozen but not quite for the cubes to keep their shape. Too frozen and the cream cheese will turn powdery.
1711	194	This recipe has been in my family for many years. (With only a few alterations.) We just always called it "Coke Salad" for lack of the appropriate name. The only difference is we also add a box of Strawberry Jello along with the Cherry. The key to mixing in the cream cheese is to let it soften before adding. Make sure to chip it very fine before adding. (Or add it while the Jello mixture is still somewhat warm.) Don't know if there is a difference in Bing Cherries and Dark Cherries but we always used the latter.
1712	195	My family LOVES this!
1713	195	Fantastic
1714	195	Have made this recipe for years.  The last time I made it I forgot to add the sugar and no one noticed.  I use 2 packages of cream cheese to 1 carton of CoolWhip.  I also add toasted, sliced almonds to the graham cracker crust before adding the CoolWhip/cream cheese mixture.  I usually use a can of cherries to which I have added almond extract.  Quick, easy and light.  A family favorite.
1715	195	Made once & again today for Thanksgiving with my sweet potato pies as well. You really can't go wrong with this simple, delicious dessert pie!  Enjoy!
1716	195	I didn't have lemon juice but I have everything else.  I'm gonna try  a tbsp of lemon tea and vanilla  . Hey its my only  alternative.  But still  is so  awesome.  I used to make it every Christmas and  take  to parents  my dads all time  favorite and mine  too
1717	195	this came out so easy and tasty! I wanted to make it more low-sugar, so used 1/4 cup Splenda in place of regular sugar; also used Reddi Wip instead of the tub stuff, which only needed about half a can (just kind of eyeballed to the right consistency); then added some cinnamon, clove and ginger to my "no sugar added" cherry pie filling. came out just right consistency and very tasty,  my hubby even requested it again and again! Real simple easy winner!
1718	195	This was wonderful. So easy to make, light and delicious, and  not too sweet. I would have given it 5 stars but I slightly altered the recipe by adding some almond extract to the cherries.
1719	195	This is a light, fluffy cheesecake filling that is Delish!  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar in the recipe.  No one would notice that substitution if you didn't mention it.  This lovely pie would make a great Valentine's Day dessert...or Washington's Birthday!  Have fun in the kitchen and enjoy your dessert!
1720	195	It's OK... It's not WONDERFUL but it's OK for a no bake. It's not bad. It's fast to make. If i ever need a recipe for a fast pie i'll probably make this again.
1721	196	OMG  8 servings at Per Serving: 3565 calories!!!!!!  YIKES, then I'll pass.
1722	196	This was a great topping! Family raved about the extra crunch with the almonds and it paired perfectly with the cherry pie. Thanks Chef John!
1723	196	I have to give this recipe 5 stars!  This pie was very good, I only had Cool Whip to go with it, I wish I would have had vanilla bean ice cream because I know it would have been even better.  I loved the crunchiness of the topping, a bit different than a regular strudel.  I will make this one every year when tart cherries are in season.
1724	196	The crumble topping was delicious. Much better than crust on the top.
1725	196	Very Flavorful and so Easy!
1726	196	Another amazing recipe and instructional video by Chef John! Turned out amazingly, family loved it! I will just say though that I personally felt the topping was too salty and next time I will cut the salt in half. ( I am a salt nut on savory foods trust me, but I personally do not like salty desserts.  So if you don't like salty/sweet desserts, then cut it in half.)
1727	196	I haven't made it yet.  I have a pie cherry (very tart) tree and am wondering if they'd work in this recipe.  Looks like everyone who rated it just used regular cherries.
1728	196	Made this last night and a quarter of it is missing this morning!  Husband really loves this pie.  Tart, yet sweet.  The almonds in the topping add flavor and crunch.  Really tasty. Made exactly as written.
1729	196	The topping was way too salty.  Trying to figure out what I did wrong.  The filling was great.
1730	197	I'm going to attempt the recipe, but you should know that the ingredient list calls for 4 eggs, Step 2 uses 4 eggs, and Step 3 calls for 1 egg. Does this mean that the ingredient list should show 5 eggs? Maybe this caused some of the issues reviewers mentioned?
1731	197	Loved it! Great instructions, easy to follow. They were absolutely DELICIOUS! I did have to bake for 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.So wonderful to find a gluten free recipe that tastes amazing.
1732	197	After almost 25 min over the max cook time it remained lava cake like. Taste is ok, nothing too exciting. Will not be making this again. Very disappointed
1733	197	A couple notes. 1) There's a lot more of the cheesecake topping than I expected, and it covered more of the top than the promo pictures show. 2) Don't get rid of all the jelly stuff from the cherry pie filling. Use some of it on the brownies. 3) I needed to bake this for about an hour rather than the 35-45 minutes stated in the recipe.
1734	197	The first time I made these brownies, they did not turn out well.  Original recipe is gluten-free, with no specific instructions for making conventional brownies.
1735	197	real easy to make
1737	197	Wow! All I can say is Super Yummy! Had to bake for one hour and they turned out even better than I imagined. I’ll definitely be making these lots more.
1738	197	I will make this again. It was very easy to make.
1739	198	I made this exactly as written, no variations. It tastes exactly the sweet & sour sauce at my favorite Chinese restaurant. I have saved the recipe and will definitely make this many times again. I have looked everywhere for this sauce to make at home and I am so happy to have finally found it.
1740	198	So easy &  fast great on everything. Tastes just like a restaurant made it.
1741	198	I did cut back on the marachino cherry juice and subst. ketchup for color...this was by far the best sweet and sour recipe I've found so far.  Thank you!
1742	198	I would omit the cherry juice altogether. I had to dump it out and start over because I couldn't get it to not taste like cherries.
1743	198	With Yellow fruit punch and cranberry juice (what I had) it was exceptional, will do it again with those juice, didn't taste totally like sweet and sour sauce but was more unique I really just try it!! With eggrolls was perfect
1744	198	not exact same taste this way but I used apple cider vinegar for this and it came out soooo good!
1745	198	I really like this recipe.  I added a little Sriracha   sauce and pineapple bits and cherry bits.  It is superb!
1746	198	Thank you! This was exactly what I was looking for. Just made it and it is perfect.
1747	198	Just a shout out to the two "most helpful" reviewers. I actually hate the ketchup based sauces and was offering an alternative. There are plenty of ketchup based asian sauces on Allrecipes, if you like your sweet and sour to taste of ketchup, feel free to use them. The whole point of this recipe however, was to provide a lighter, thinner, fruitier alternative to the ketchup based sauces. Thanks for the feedback though. Sparklers
1748	199	I did not have high expectations for this recipe and I am so glad I was wrong! My niece and her two daughters absolutely loved this and I did too. I used white marshmallows and maraschino cherries because that's what I had. Thanks for sharing this addictive recipe!
1749	199	This was one of my favorite recipes as a child and now I make it every holiday season. A big hit in our home.  The only thing I changed was reduced the amount of nuts in half.
1750	199	Awesome! Just like Aunt Flo used to make....thanks so much for posting.
1751	199	What can you say?  Its a good, easy sweet and tasty treat!  I served some and froze the other half.  Held up great in the freezer, so handy.  Thanks!
1752	199	I've been making this Christmas "cookie" ever since I was teeny-tiny. This recipe works with almost any kind of grahams you have on hand and it really dosen't have to be colored marshmallows. It's really up to you. I do suggest you don't chinze out and use cheap sweetened condensed milk because you'll have issues getting it to come together and for me, it just dosen't taste the same. This is also good if you use half coconut/half chopped pecans to roll the log in OR add about a half cup to the marshmallow mixture.
1753	199	This is what my mom made every year for my birthday parties (but without the nuts and cheeries!).  I have a bag of coloured marshmallows and decided to make some for my little girl but couldn't find the recipe.  Thanks for posting it!
1754	199	Didn't go as fast as I expected it to. Just wasn't to my family's liking.
1755	199	When I made these for my fiance, she agreed to marry me.
1756	199	This is a recipe I have made every Christmas for the past 23 years I have been married, and was handed from my Grandmother before that.  It is a "must" at the holidays, and will keep in the freezer, ready to be sliced, for months!
1757	200	I really liked this recipe! Its a very light sauce for canning the cherries, so it lets the flavor of the cherries be the star.
1758	201	This was delicious!  I used boneless chicken breast, pounded thin, and fresh bing cherries, halved, pitted, and soaked in about 1/4 c water and a tsp of sugar (used a little less sugar in the sauce because of this). Because I used breasts which didn’t yield much liquid, I added a little butter to the pan when I removed the chicken to sauté the cherries in the drippings.  Aside from these small changes, I followed the recipe exactly. A keeper!
1759	201	I tried this but with a variation, I used pork ribeye instead of chicken, used more cherries ( fresh) & orange ( actually used mandarins instead) than the recipe called for. Also added some fresh herbs, some thyme, lemon thyme, basil & purple basil. Also added about 1/2 cup red mascato to the mix. Simmered for about 10 minutes, then poured over the pork, simmered another 10 minutes then served with rice. Yummy! Will try with chicken next time.
1760	201	My husband and I loved this dish!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used only chicken breasts and legs because my grocer doesn't carry cut-up chickens anymore (go figure).  It truly does taste like it's restaurant-quality.  I served it with wild rice and asparagus.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.
1761	201	My husband couldn't get enough!  I used fresh bings also. Otherwise I followed the recipe except for using slightly less sugar. Will definitely make again
1762	201	made with half sugar, fresh cherries lightly simmered, flour instead of cornmeal, and coconut instead of almond. was awesome! will definitely do again!
1763	201	loved it, loved it !!!!
1764	201	Very good, the flavors go well together. The almonds are wonderful in this dish. I used boneless skinless chicken breast and just used a little more oil. I served it with rice on the side and will make this again.
1765	201	Totally awesome. Everyone went back for seconds
1766	201	I had to abort the first attempt at making this recipe because I had never used canned sweet dark cherries.  After opening the can and tasting one of these mushy tasteless things- I was not about to ruin my chicken.  Second time I used dried cherries heated in water till slightly softened- oh sooo much better -more flavor acutually taste like cherries and a little texture-  FInished the recipe as written- using a half the sugar
1767	202	Excellent!!  Light and fluffy.  The only changes I made were adding a brick of cream cheese, due to the reviews of being thin and runny.  I also used a 10" Graham cracker pie crust and switched out pecans for the walnuts.  Be sure to strain your pineapples in a strainer for about 10 minutes and pat dry with paper towel.  Complete hit.  I will definitely be making this again!!
1768	202	Delicious one of my favorite
1769	202	This is an easy pie.  Make sure all your fruit is drained completely, the cool whip is thawed out and your pie crust has cooled down before filling and you won't have any problems with the pie being runny.
1836	209	I added 3 oz. Apricot Greek yogurt from Trader Joe's.  My wife will not eat Figs and she absolutely enjoyed this recipe.
1770	202	I made this tonight thinking I could serve it after I made dinner but, that wasn't the case. I didn't use any nuts since my family doesn't care for them. It still hasn't completely set up yet and I did drain and squeeze out the juice. That's ok though I just had to invite my brother back over for dinner again tomorrow.  Hopefully it will be ready then. The filling tastes very good,  sweet but good :) **UPDATE ** I had extra filling leftover and since it wasn't setting I put a cup of it in the freezer. It made delicious ice cream!! I highly recommend saving some to freeze!
1771	202	Great easy & simply recipe! Used pecans instead of walnuts and used a ready made graham cracker crust. There was a lot of extra so we ate it in a bowl w/o pie shell. Was nearly enough for another pie!
1772	202	I made this and my family loved it.  Making it again this week.
1773	202	Very tasty!!!! I also added 8 oz of cream cheese and mixed it in with the sweetened condensed milk!
1774	202	This was delish! The only changes I made was swap the walnuts with pecans and didn't add the cherries. I chilled mine overnight so that way the filling will settle before I cut into it. But I got a lot of compliments on it!!
1775	202	This is my favorite pie from childhood. Love it! I used a graham cracker crust.
1776	203	Added cinnamon, lemon zest and lemon juice to the batter. Cut back some of the sugar. It was delicious!!!
1777	203	Just like the recipe my mom had. Easy to prepare. Will cut the recipe in half for six people instead of 12 next time.
1778	203	Followed this recipe pretty closely this first time. Family liked it and looks forward to having it again.
1779	203	I made this for a family lunch and everyone loved it.  There were eight adults and this cake was gone before they left!  I did get a small piece and agree it’s a keeper and is included in my favorites file.
1780	203	Been struggling to use sour cherries and this is a tasty and very simple cake. My sour cherries were frozen so I strained them and used four cups. I used 3/4 cup sugar in cake batter and 1/2 cup sugar in cherries. Also used vanilla extract instead of almond. Cooked for about 4O minutes. Cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was yummy.
1781	203	Very close to Grandma’s cherry Kuchen. Use a can of sour/tart cherries. Reserve the juice and combine with 1/4 c sugar and 2-3 tbsp of corn starch to create sauce.  Cook sauce about 10-15 minutes over medium heat until it thickens. Cut and place cake portion on plate and Spoon sauce over cherry cake. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
1782	203	A friend gave me several pounds of frozen tart cherries and I was looking for a good recipe that wasn't cherry pie, cherry pie is too syrupy for me, but this recipe makes a a crazy good coffee cake. I tried it warm with ice cream on top but I liked it better the next day when the ingredients meld together. The cake part didn't harden, it stayed soft and moist. I didn't refrigerate it so it wouldn't dry up. Just covered it with plastic wrap. Next time I make it I want to try baking it with oatmeal crumb crisp or streusel topping for a yummy brunch cake.
1783	203	Made as directed.  Excellent!  Will definitely make again!
1784	203	Very bland, sticky on the bottom (uncooked dough in parts, with sides and top all browned, isn't the same as pudding imo), way way too sweet (and I used very tart cherries from my yard).  You're better off making pancakes and tossing cherries in the batter and it'll be tastier.
1785	204	This was delicious!! I used the dark chocolate oreo cookies.
1786	204	This is so delicious and soooo easy!  I also love that these are made as “individual” servings!! I will be making these again soon!!!
1787	204	A huge hit!
1788	204	Amazing! Make anytime of year. No changes needed.  Super big hit with my friends. Definitely on favourites list.
1789	204	I used the larger sized muffin tins, so I added a bit more cookie crumbs to the bottom.  I used 6 more cookies and just scraped out the middle cream so that I could crush just the cookie part.  I also had to bake them about 10 minutes longer.  They came out fabulous!  This made ten total.
1790	204	Easy and delicious!  They only had double stuffed Oreos and the bottom of each was kind of hard.  I think it was probably just too much cream filling.
1791	204	Made these as per the recipe and they were divine!  So yum!
1792	204	I made these for my husband's birthday. They were amazing. The only change I made was leaving off the whipped cream. (Not a fan.) They are the perfect little individual-size portions. Perfectly chocolatey with the texture and taste of cheesecake and, of course, the cherry topping. Yummy!
1793	204	I have made these several times and they are always a big hit !I make them according to the recipe as written. They can be made a couple if days ahead of time and hold up very well in the fridge.
1794	205	Followed the receipt
1795	205	It was so amazing
1796	205	Very delicious.......Please visit at: https://www.healthyfoodcare.co.in/
1797	205	I have a fig tree so love this recipe which utilizes the figs in two different ways.  I followed the recipe except used a 15x9 pan and put the filling on top which was gorgeous.  Delicious, rustically pretty and simple. Thank you!
1798	205	It was ok.  I followed the directions exactly.  The cake texture was similar to a coffee cake.  It was best warm.  It just did not have a lot of flavor.
1799	205	The only changes were parchment paper lining pans, and decorating with fresh Figs on top! I love Figs! It pairs well with a Sauvignon Blanc!
1800	205	I was given a basket of fresh figs and came looking for a recipe. I was drawn to the simplicity of this one and also the good reviews. Because I have a tiny kitchenette in which to cook, I used a food processor rather than a standard mixer. I only changed a few things—I puréed the figs, I omitted almond extract, used half and half instead of evaporated milk and added a handful of chopped pecans. The batter was delicious and I had high hopes. I used my silicon muffin “tin” (1/2 cup per muffin; made 8). I baked for 45 minutes at 350. The muffins came out brown on the outside and doughy in the inside. Not good. I don’t know exactly what went wrong.
1801	205	Doubling the recipe worked well for 9" cake pans. As a commercial grower we store many frozen figs that thaw to be very soft and this is ideal for mashing rather than chopping in this recipe. The filling requires a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to avoid over cooking to proper thickness. Really a splendid cake!
1802	205	Made in a 9x13 pan instead of layers. Easy to make. Icing taste great. My figs were a little sweet to start with. Haven't cut the cake yet... Still hot. But I'm sure it's going to be delicious... Smelled yummy baking.
1835	209	Good way to use up frozen figs from summer.  I added flax seed to bump up the nutrition.  I've also used hemp powder and put some plain yogurt in in with a bit of honey.
1803	206	First an important note. Lemosn naturally contain pectin, so they are absolutely necessary to help this gel nicely.  I slice mine paper thin on a mandolin so they cook down to nothing, but leave their bright flavor and geling qualities behind.  I also shop the figs coarsely after draining from their boiling bath so I get more of a jam and not so much whole fruit. Love this with a scrape of vanilla beans and a cinnamon stick or star anise cooked in the jam. Process as usual for jams and itis a huge hit.
1804	206	Ripping Good Recipe. Super easy to make.
1805	206	Very good. Need to work on getting the sugar and lemon balance better. May try honey next time. I also didn’t use as much water because my figs were thawed from when I froze them back in August (now November), but I also didn’t want the jam to thin. It was perfect!
1806	206	Love it!  It’s really easy. Costco carried Fig Jam at one time and we fell in love with it.  And after a run they discontinued it.  I had no  idea it was so easy to make, so when figs are in season I make fig jam
1807	206	This is delicious and so easy!  I make it exactly as written, but I also add a dash of cinnamon.  Almost as good as my grandmother used to make.
1808	206	This is the best recipe I've found for Fig Preserves like my Mimi and MaMaw used to make when I was little! I sometimes leave the lemon out. The figs come out sweet and plump!
1809	206	I added 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger. Cooked 1 1/2 hrs and added two mandolin sliced thin lemons. Very nice recipe. They look delicious. And they aced all the taste tests along the way!
1810	206	I fixed this recipe yesterday.  I helped my Mom, Aunt and Grandmother make all types of jams and jellies, vegetables.  Unfortunately I have forgotten all I learned from them.  Your recipe was very helpful.
1811	206	Now I won't be wasting given figs ever. Never liked the taste of fresh figs. Followed the recipe and results are delicious. Excellent recipe. Thank you for sharing!
1812	207	This elegant and delightfully presented dish is a treat to serve and to enjoy as one hears the inevitable sighs and compliments of "Delicious!" The mixture of honey with the balsamic vinegar drizzle is an outstanding combination! Excellent! I highly recommend it!
1813	207	I have a fig tree and have been looking for a simple recipe to use my fruit in an enjoyable way.   This recipe is the ticket.
1814	207	This was very popular.  Some notes: The  recipe should list  "salted" almonds, not just almonds.  Watch the almonds closely under the heat, so they don't get burned.
1815	207	Made exactly as directed. Thought pretty bland and boring.  Same night also made the recipe with arugula and figs (and substituted  the pArmesean cheese with goat cheese) and it was a much bigger hit with everyone.
1816	207	A wonderful appetizer recipe. If you don't like figs, you probably won't like this but for us fig lovers, this is the bomb!
1817	207	Delicious! Easiest thing in the world to make!
1818	207	These are heavenly. Made exactly as written. I set them up a few hours before the party and left covered in the fridge. I baked them once my guests arrived. Easy as can be and everybody was so impressed to have a "fancy" appetizer.
1819	207	I really liked these, they were even better the next day after they'd soaked in the balsamic/honey sauce..just plopped them on top of my mixed green salad for lunch...
1820	207	We love these ingredients separately but together they really didn't work for us. Sorry to say. Easy to prepare though.
1821	208	This is a delicious Fall salad when fresh figs are in season. I use Fig Balsamic vinegar. It’s been a big hit with my family.
1822	208	Substituted red grapes for figs as no fresh figs available, figuring 4 grapes = 1 fig.  Used chopped walnuts as another reviewer had suggested.   It was delicious!  Doubled recipe to serve four people and all loved it.
1823	208	Yummy! Very good. I added a little red onion.
1824	208	Delicious and simple salad.  A little too sweet as is for me so minus one star.  My changes to make it a 5 star - grill or roast the figs first so they are nice and soft.  To the dressing I added about 4 TBSP olive oil and a dash of salt and pepper.  Whisked the dressing up first before pouring it over the salad.  I used feta instead of parmesan and that was very nice.
1825	208	I started making it and turned out I was out of figs.  I tossed in a dried fruit medley of cranberries, white grape, and blueberries. It was all I could think of in a pinch.  Everything else was the same.  I loved this salad.  I will have to pick up some Figs, so I can have it as recipe states.  I love it already, so I am sure it will be off the charts with Figs!

1827	208	This is super healthy, easy and what's not to love about arugula and figs :)  I have a fig tree so this is a keeper for me.
1828	208	Delicious!  This is now one of my favorite salads.  Thanks for sharing!  The first time I made it I used arugula but found the arugula to over power the figs.  The second time I used baby spinach and it was perfect.  Tried a couple balsamics and liked the white balsamic wine vinegar the best.  I used a less expensive Parmesan but next time it would be worth splurging for the harder more aged cheese.  Wonderful flavors together and very refreshing!
1829	208	I didn't have any parmesan cheese but I did have honey goat cheese....took it to a family dinner, it was a hit!   I will make it again
1830	209	I just made this for breakfast for hubby and me. What a great way to use up some of the plethora of figs that we currently have! I don't usually have OJ so I added a couple of fresh peaches, added some chia seeds and ground flaxseed and it was just the right sweetness. Thank you!
1831	209	Great way to use fresh figs — I used 1 c. puréed figs. Subbed orange/strawberry/banana juice for plain orange and 1/4 c. milk/1/2 c. vanilla Greek yogurt. Delicious, nutritious treat gIr grandkids.
1832	209	Yes I would make this again. It was delicious
1833	209	The only thing I would review is the frozen banana part. It makes it cold but that's hard to unpeel and it wasn't necessary for me and my mom to cut it.
1834	209	Love this!!  I have a huge bag of figs from last fall in the freezer, so I searched for a smoothie calling for frozen figs. This is the closest I found. Changed it up a bit to improve the nutrition and lower the calories. Mine is only 275 calories for all this:  ½ banana, 4 frozen figs, 1 small orange, 1 cup of coconut-almond milk, a little cinnamon and ground cardamom, and 1 tsp of maca powder. Yumm!!!!
1837	209	I liked it! I would consider adding more fig and a bit less banana.
1838	209	Delicious!!! I used coconut milk instead of cow's milk. Thank you for the recipe.
1839	210	East to make. Great taste. If I had not made it myself I would have never known if was made with figs
1840	210	I doubled the recipe and added 6 cups of fresh strawberries that I had picked earlier in the year from the berry farm and had kept frozen until my figs became ripe on my tree. This made 10 half pints and 2 pints in wide mouth jars.
1841	210	I had 5 pounds of cleaned figs frozen in my freezer for years. I needed freezer space so I thawed the figs in a zip bag and warm water, chopped them up,  and made your recipe. I made a batch with strawberry jello AND one with raspberry jello also. One thing, when the figs-sugar-jello mix is cooking it tried to scorch so I added 3/4 cup of the fig juice left in the bottom of the zip bag. Made things a lot easier. I've been using my jam on cinnamon/raisin toast with cream cheese for a breakfast treat. I'm a guy and I've been canning since I was a kid.
1842	210	Do I need to peel the figs? Can I substitute crushed pineapple and pineapple jello for the strawberries? My grandmother  used pineapple to stretch the recipe but I don't have her recipe.
1843	210	Good way of using some really nice figs!
1844	210	I really love the taste. I put about 3/4 cup local honey in instead of sugar   Sugar I put 1 1/2 cup.  Made5 1/2 pints. Total. Used only one packet of strawberry jello
1845	210	Sounded to simple so I had to try it. Worked great and tastes good. It is a clear, simple flavored jam.
1846	210	this is the same recipe my grandmother used to use. best jelly ever
1847	210	This was a very easy recipe for fig preserves, I added Splenda instead of sugar, my husband is diabetic and he loved them. Irma Dark
1848	211	Was trying to use up some brown figs that had dried themselves out on the tree pretty well. And I only had yellow onion.  But I'm very happy with the results; just needed to add a little water along with the figs.  It's like jam if you don't like simple sugary fruit jam.
1849	211	So good!  I made it to the recipe.  Then I spread it on flatbread and topped with goat cheese and baked it for 15 minutes.  It was amazing!  Thanks for this great use for the fresh figs I was never sure what to do with.
1850	211	Great recipe! I used figs from my own backyard tree rather than black mission but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cook times were a little different for me, but I could tell by the descriptions when it was time to move on to the next step.  Served on crostini with goat cheese and felt fancy. Yum! Will make this again (maybe tomorrow).
1851	211	Delicious!  Used Turkey Figs and sweet vidalia onions because that’s what I had on hand. Nice flavor, texture, and color. served in a cracker with a smear of cream cheese.
1852	211	Super good and easy to make, only needed one tablespoon of sugar :)
1853	211	Very tasty. I added a Tbs. of honey and a little Red Pepper flakes . Great on cream cheese!
1854	211	NO sugar needed if you use a very good Balsamic vinegar.(i.e. there is no caramel colour!)  Red onions must be fresh and when they caramelize down, they sweeten up. So good.
1855	211	I replaced the white sugar with brown sugar! Delicious and so easy.
1856	211	This is so delicious!   I'm having it right now on crackers for my breakfast    :~D
1857	212	This was absolutely a delicious appetizer! I used fig preserves instead about 6 tbsp. and cut down simmering by 5 min.  Definitely a dish to make again!
1858	212	Enjoyed this with figs right off my tree.  It is a bit sweet and I think I may try without the vanilla next time to take the sweetness away and the Brie was till hard in the center so I’ll add more time or figure out how to test for softness better - but overall I will make again.
1859	212	This was so good! I only had an 8oz round of Brie, made the topping as stated but using  3 or 4 extra figs. I used water crackers because I didn't want to alter the flavor of the cheese. We ate the last little bit of leftovers with lunch today and I think I prefer if fresh. Thank you for sharing, I will totally do this again!
1860	212	This was delicious!  Very rich - will make again.
1861	212	This is delicious!  Everyone loved it so much there was none left over!
1862	212	I used toasted pecans. Came out delish!!
1863	212	I loved this!  So yummy!  It is a bit on the sweet side, but I have absolutely no problem with that.  Appetizer or Dessert (hehe)!
1864	212	double the nuts and figs. delicious!
1865	212	Fantastic!!! Didnt change anything, except this was ready after 5 min in the oven... Guests asked for recipe naturally :) So easy to make... once you find the fresh figs. I finally found some at Whole Foods.
1866	213	halved the sugar and used half whole wheat half white flour and used half applesauce half oil
1867	213	This recipe is easy, very tasty. They stay moist stored in a food bag. The flavor is best after these are completely cooled. This is a favorite for me!
1868	213	Great recipe for figs! I used whole wheat flour and added an extra teaspoon of baking soda with a pinch of salt. I doubled the spices for our personal preference and a stevia blend for the white sugar. Low fat and high fiber — perfect for breakfast with yogurt!
1869	213	We all loved them. The oatmeal & fig seeds added a nice texture. Will certainly make again.
1870	213	This recipe is so easy and the muffins so tasty! Love them!
1871	213	A friend gave me some figs, so I thought this recipe would be a great way to make them.  I didn't have the flax, so I added extra oatmeal.  The first batch was bland and dense, so I added baking soda and walnuts to the second half.  This improved the recipe, so I would recommend changing the recipe to 2 teaspoons baking soda and a teaspoon of salt, as well as a cup of chopped walnuts.
1872	213	PS - unsweetened applesauce is just fine in this recipe.
1873	213	Good way to use my figs.  Next time I’ll add some nuts.
1874	213	They were good, but they were little denser than I thought. That is probably because I'm not used to cooking with oatmeal and flax seed powder.
1875	214	So easy and so good.  Tastes rich but it isn't.  Passing this one on to all my friends with figs
1876	214	Easy and delicious! I used bone-in chicken thighs successfully.
1877	214	I was so pleased to find a recipe that would utilize my home-grown figs and Rosemary. The recipe was easy to follow and it was a real crowd-pleaser at our house!
1878	214	Substituted dried Sunkist dried figs soaked in water for 4 hours for fresh.  That added to the sweetness.  Served with a nice pinot noir.  Delightful!
1879	214	It was delicious and very easy as well. It was a great way to use the fresh figs I found recently.
1880	214	Really good
1881	214	I cut the recipe to two servings, but added extra figs because mine were small and I have a LOT on the tree and he LOVES  them! After looking at it, I really wanted color so I added sliced red bell during the browning of the chicken. Made a beautiful dish with roasted potatoes and fresh broccoli. Thank you !
1882	214	So easy and absolutely awesome!  I used a fig balsamic as well and it was off the charts with flavour, a new family favourite!
1883	214	I've made this dish several times now, and it's always a hit. I've served it to my family, and for company and it always earns some compliments.  I recently tried changing it up a little by switching the figs for cherry tomatoes (added during simmering instead of pre-boil) and switching the rosemary for fresh oregano.  It's a versatile, easy, and delicious meal.
1884	215	I think the recipe calls for too much water.  In order to make it less soup like I had to boil it an additional 30 mins.  I don’t have an immersion blender and didn’t want to put the ‘goop’ in my Kitchenaid blender… that’d be a pain to clean out.
1885	215	I made this recipe with cold pressed avocado spread instead of butter to make it vegan. It turned out perfectly fine and delicious. This recipe made about 6 cups of fig jam. I put it individual containers and gave away 5! Kept one for myself & it is smooth. Making a second batch tonight and added Mort figs this time - about 6 cups. I blended in cusinart after cooling for a few minute.
1886	215	I made it like the recipe except I had to add a little brown sugar to make the equivalent of 2 cups of honey. I used Marseille figs from my young tree. I wasn’t sure if they were ripe. I had frozen them until I got around to making it. It turned out delicious. I am canning 4- 8 oz. jars. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
1887	215	delicious. cooked for 2 or 3 hours. did not thicken until i used the immersion blender
1888	215	Yummy! Used almonds.
1889	215	Delicious!
1890	215	Fantastic recipe! Had about 30lbs of Figs off my bush this year, needed to find a good recipe and this one is excellent. My variety is Turkish Brown, and they are a meaty fig.  Didn't have any problems with the preserve being too thin. It cooked, jarred and water bathed very easy. Will use this again and again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe
1891	215	The taste is wonderful but it's too thin. I actually cooked longer than the recipe called for. I'm going to put in hot jars and process is a hot water bath.  I'll give as gifts as a sauce/salad dressing rather than preserves
1892	215	Pretty easy recipe and tastes great.
1893	216	This was my first time ever making jam or jelly. I read all the reviews thoroughly and decided to take all the advice and pull it together. I definitely used the little food processor or chopper to chop my figs. Also, there was not a packet of liquid CERTO pectin to be found in the store.  ?? I ended up purchasing the powdered sister-product to CERTO - Sure-Jell.  When I mixed in the sugar and the Sure-Jell, I also found that the sugar was not dissolving and mixing in well. I put it on a low heat until the sugar was dissolved and it made a thick jam. I reduce the sugar to approximately 3 to 3 1/2 cups as I definitely didn’t want it too sweet. At first taste it’s a bit too much lemon so I’m hoping that will meld together as it cools and sits for a bit and that the sugar will continue to dissolve well.  It’s nice and thick, the way jam should be. Also not icky sweet. I am using this on an authentic Italian bruschetta with brie, prosciutto, and arugula, so you want a bit of sweetness, but, not overpowering. I’m excited to try it I did put it on a cracker with some laughing cow Swiss cheese and it was delicious! ?? ????? ? i’m super excited to share it with our friends this weekend and hear what they have to say. You can see my picture it perfectly filled four of the small canning glass jars!
1894	216	I added vanilla, cinnamon & cloves in small amounts. It gives it a nice kick. I only used 4 cups of sugar rather than the 5 in the recipe and even reducing it by a cup it’s too sweet. I cooked it at a low temp to get the sugar to dissolve completely. I put in both packets of pectin as recommended but it’s a little runny. Maybe because I reduced the sugar it didn’t set up. No matter, it’s so delicious I could eat the whole jar!
1895	216	I actually haven't made it, but the directions don't say to cook it but most of the comments say that they did.  Which is correct please
1896	216	This was very easy to make and tastes heavenly!!! I only used half the pectin and still turned out lovely. Made 7 small jars.
1897	216	Easy
1898	216	I have been making fig jam for a few weeks now and I find that there is NON NEED to use pectin. It cooks down to a cohesive, jam like mass.
1899	216	This was very good it turned out better than I hoped!!
1900	216	It turned out great, but I did make a couple of changes.  At the end I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon to it and cooked before I froze it.  My reason for cooking it was that I was trying to make it thicker.  It made it a little thicker, but the greater benefit for letting it cook awhile is that it blended the flavors together beautifully.  I froze them in smaller containers because I plan to put the jam on kolaches.  Thank you!
1901	216	This one didn't firm for me and the sugar never dissolved.  I ended up having to cook it a little bit to get the sugar to dissolve and for the jam to 'jell' together.  The flavor was perfect after cooking.
1902	217	This was outstanding!  Rich, moist, perfection.   Took 60 minutes in convection oven at 350 degrees, but just one part of the loaf was not cooked on top in the middle at the highest point just about equal to a tablespoon.   Didn't want to bake it any longer because the ends would be too dry.  Next time I may add 5 more minutes.  Only substitutes I made were I used butter to coat pan versus nonstick cooking spray and when it cooled it was a just a bit tough to remove, but I slid a flat serving utensil on all sides and then lifted it a bit with two utensils.  It was still warm after a half hour of cooling, sooooo good!  The other thing I used was a very good vanilla extract versus almond extract.  Not a big fan of almond flavor as it is in so many Italian cookie recipes.  I added a photo and you will see where it cracked a bit when I took it out of pan because I didn't coat the pan enough.  I definitely waited the 20 to 30 minutes to remove it from pan!!  Oh I added a few extra figs, as we have a fig tree in our back yard for years and years that my husband tends to and covers it every winter!
1903	217	I have made this recipe twice and both times I got rave reviews! I will be making it again for Christmas. It reminds me of a similar cake my mom made when I was a kid. I added more figs than what the recipe calls for and omitted the powder sugar. Very delicious cake!
1904	217	Very good!  Much like pound cake with fruit.  I did not use powdered sugar. Sweet enough.  I did add a few more figs.
1905	217	So moist!  I used part of the batter to make muffins also.  I skipped the powdered sugar.
1999	231	This recipe is great! I did leave the skins on and just chopped them smaller as someone else suggested. So delicious.
1906	218	Was super easy, I added some ground clove along with the cinnamon and I used roasted pecans instead of walnuts. I couldn’t get my cookies flat though, even with making the 2nd batch smaller.
1907	218	Just got done making the cookies. I put the cookies in the middle of the oven at 375 and they started burning at the 10 minute point. So I pulled them out . I lowered my next batch to 350 and that seemed to work out better for me. I did not have the walnuts so I doubled up on the Fig. I also added nutmeg. Not very sweet like you said but tasty just the same. I will definitely make these again.
1908	218	With an abundance of figs this year, these cookies were a hit at our house!  Only change I made was adding more cinnamon - 1/2 t, and increased the salt to 1/4t because I use unsalted butter.  Delicious - thank you!
1909	218	I enjoy the taste of these cookies. These are not overly sweet. A great compliment to morning coffee. It takes some patience to work with the figs - but it is well worth the effort and the time. Not a recipe for a quick & easy process.. Great for me as I enjoy projects with a bit more detail.
1910	218	Really enjoyed. Followed other reviewers recommendations to add more figs and a little ground Clove and glad I did. Will add more nuts next time too (pecans). Not too sweet. Nice and moist. Cake like texture. Will make again.
1911	218	Absolutely delicious!! Subbed pecans because I didn’t have walnuts. Almost skipped the fig on top, but so glad I didn’t- that added a yummy figgy goodness to the cookie!
1912	218	Absolutely loved it! I used frozen figs instead of fresh and used a cup of diced figs and no nuts.  Otherwise no other changes.
1913	218	It was an easy recipe and tasted more like a sugar cookie than an august fig cookie. We also needed to chop our fig to get chunks of figs and we needed to chop our nuts too. Other than that they were delicious, not too sweet but not too fig-like.
1914	218	I love this recipe. It’s so easy to make and really a good way to use the figs that your coworker gives you.
1915	219	Very good.  Will use fig jam next time for ease.
1916	219	Everyone loved this! We used fig spread instead of chopped figs, which was much easier.  I would suggest chopping the basil into pieces instead of strips, it makes for easier cutting of the final product.  Also sprinkled some chopped basil on the top since the finished product looks like raw meat and isn't very appetizing, but sure tastes good!  We quadrupled this recipe to get two logs that were about 12" each.  It fed 15 people as an appetizer.
1917	219	Excellent! Because it isn't "fresh fig" time of the year, I used fig preserves instead and it came out just fantastic. My friends raved (and then asked for the recipe.) Thanks!
1918	219	Easy and Tasty
1919	219	Delicious and impressive appetizer.  Fig preserve works well if fresh figs are not available.
1920	219	Very simple to make and very tasty.  I couldn't find any honey goat cheese so I just added a bit of honey to regular goat cheese. Worked well and you can adjust it to your own tastes.
1921	219	I love this combination of sweet, savory, salty, and smoky. I'm going to try this with fig jam instead of fresh figs and see how that turns out, too.
1922	219	Yes!
1923	220	I added more figs and I didn't have nutmeg, so I used ginger, as that's still a complementary spice for this wonderful seasonal dessert.
1924	220	Full of flavour!! I added lest cloves (cloves usually take over the flavours) and it does taste like a spice cake, but the figs are a great addition
1925	220	I live in a remote location off grid, with no local access to a grocery store for recipe ingredients, so for this I substituted walnuts for pecans and powdered for condensed milk, and I made no frosting. The result is the most delicious cake I have ever made, very moist, with a bold texture and nicely accented with cinnamon and nutmeg. I used fresh figs from my garden.
1926	220	Love this moist yummy cake.??????
1927	220	Great cake.  Made it as an upside down cake and it wowed the guests.  Served it with whipped cream  Yum.
1928	220	Really tasty, and a great way to use up my fresh figs. It freezes very well also!
1929	220	This cake was awesome! I have a fig tree and every year need to find things to make with figs, so a friend of mine and I gave this a try last night. We didn't make the icing. We tried it while it was pretty hot, so the flavors didn't immediately come through--- but by the third bite, we were hooked! Will definitely make again!
1930	220	This cake is excellent.  My kids and husband all loved this.  I agree with other reviewers that the figs are not a big part of the flavor, more of a moist spice cake.  I did not change anything except to leave out the pecans as my family are not fond of nuts in baked goods.
1931	220	Very good....very moist.  I added about 2 1/2 cups of figs, and probably could have added a bit more flour, it is moist and very good.  I think its a little sweet, though my figs were very sweet too....taking that in mind, I'd cut the sugar a bit next time...frosting was delish.  Alot like caramel....very yummy overall!
1932	221	Love it....had to cook a little longer to gel however great results and easy to navigate the recipe.  I emulsified my fruit and added a few blackberries too! Yummy and no additives ❤
1933	221	I try to avoid sugar, so used Bocha Sweet in this recipe.  Unlike some alternative sweeteners, it doesn't crystallize in the fridge.  Cooked and cooked this, checked for gelling, and finally decided it won't happen unless you use real sugar.  However, it tastes amazing and my husband will be thrilled to swirl this into his morning yogurt. Might try throwing some pectin in if I make this again.
1934	221	I made jam for the first time with this recipe and I followed it exactly, except that the cooking time was longer than 25 minutes to get a thicker consistency. It is really tasty!
1935	221	Oh my gosh! This is fantastic! The only thing I did differently was to add twice as much berries because I had two “fat”cups of figs that we pick off the tree this morning. Kept everything else the same using lemon vs lime, just seemed a better fit. I didn’t smash the berries first because I figured the immersion would do them in anyway. I also simmered ten or fifteen minutes longer to get a thicker consistency. Thank you so much for sharing!
1936	222	This was a really nice salad! I did pretty much stick to the recipe, with the exception that I only used about half of a small red onion rather than the whole thing, and only 2 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar instead of 3. We served this with grilled steak and grilled bread, and everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!
1937	223	It's much better than I thought it'd be. The dried fruits really create this sweet and savory experience that is enhanced by the texture the almonds create. I went an hour and 20 minutes at 325 degrees for a 4 pound leg of lamb and it came out pretty medium rare in the middle!
1938	223	I did not stuff the lamb, but made the glaze.  The kids (teens) LOVED it!  They took the left over glaze and finished it off on top of sliced italian bread!  I'm not sure that I would ever stuff the lamb as the family likes it as is, but I make the glaze for both lamb and pork loin.  It's amazing!
1939	223	Was  a true success with our guests.  Lot's of flavour.  The "stuffing" and the sauce were a great compliment.  We would have preferred the roast to be more rare than the 140 degree recommendation provided
1940	223	This recipe was absolutely delicious! A show stopper with beautiful flavor! You won't be disappointed! Make this for company and holidays or just for a nice dinner! Yum!
1941	223	Wow. I LOVED the seasoning. I had a 5 pound lamb but the way it was shaped after we unrolled it we decided to cut it in half so it was now only 2.5 pounds.  We cooked one in the instant Pot and one in the oven as directed.  After 25 minutes at 400  in the oven, it was not done at all so I added another 10 minutes and it still was only 100 degrees inside. I cooked it a little more and then decided to take it out because the Intant pot one was done. I doubled all the seasonings and I was very happy with it. I probably didn't need to double the fig sauce. I used some dried figs that were not the figs mentioned. I also found a bottle of the liquor that was the size of an airline bottle for only $3. My kids gave me 8.5 and 9 rating. Husband said 9, so this is really high so I will make this for an occasion and now know to  cook it longer in the oven and lesss time in the instant pot. 25 minutes in the inlant pot would have been fine.  Then glaze in the oven.  I should not have cooked it more in the pot.
1942	223	I followed the recipe with no substitutions.  AMAZING!!!  I will make it like this from now on!  I cooked it at 350 degrees, checked it at 40 minutes, then another 20 minutes, and then another 10 minutes until it reached 135 degrees.  It was medium well in the center.  I wont cook it as long next time as I did let it rest the 15 minutes, so I feel it was just a little over done.  EXCELLENT Recipe for lamb!!
1943	223	Wonderful recipe especially for those who say they do not like LAMB! The creme de cassis liqueur makes a huge difference! Highly recommended!
1944	223	I made this last Christmas and it was such a hit, they refuse Christmas dinner this year unless I make it again (how boring- but ok).  It was easy enough to make.  I definitely would triple the herb recipe and use the currants and cassis if you can find it.  I also would suggest only the first 25-30 mins at 400 and then lowering your oven temp to 325.  Lastly as other posters have mentioned- TAKE IT OUT OF THE OVEN AT 125-130.  Over cooked lamb has no flavor- let it rest under foil till temp hits 130-135.  I promise DEEEELISH!! oh  and make extra balsamic dressing- it goes fast!!
1945	223	Just a comment that the video doesn't load...Looks like a fabulous recipe!
1946	224	Just added a little water at the end to get the consistency right.
1947	224	Turned out really good. I served it with garlic, rosemary chicken.
1948	224	I had a sackful of figs to get through so I quadrupled this recipe. Very tangy! I'll probably add less balsamic vinegar next time. Great with butter and toast. I have some to a friend who plans on using it to cook chicken.
1949	224	This was rather dry. I had to add water to really moisten the figs and try to get the mixture more syrupy. The bourbon flavor really disappeared. I thought it was just okay, but husband really liked it. We had it on sliced baguette with chevre. It was especially good when the fig jam was still warm.
1950	224	Super easy to make! Used it over my Thanksgiving baked Brie instead of the lingonberry jam I traditionally use. Followed all the directions and ingredients to a T. Set off the Brie really nicely.
1951	224	Tastes very good, sweetness of dates plus the bourbon flavour makes for a great match
1952	224	This was a great little treat!  I bought some beautiful fresh figs, thinking of some sort of appetizer but found this recipe and gave it a try.  It's delicious and also a way to impress your guests when you tell them you made it yourself!  Don't tell them how simple it was!  Yummy!
1953	224	I had tons of fresh figs from a tree out back, so I used about two plus cups of fresh diced figs. I also have some fancy balsamic vinegars: traditional balsamic, black cherry balsamic and Sicilian lemon white balsamic which I used in 3 parts. I used a sweeter scotch since I didn't have  bourbon. I reduced on low for quite a while, maybe 40
1954	224	This is so delicious.  However I didn't have whiskey so I used coconut rum. Great with cheese and very addictive. It also tastes better and better as days go by.  Thanks for sharing @JSchubert
1955	225	Made just the sauce to serve over leftover chicken legs and loved it.  Definitely make again, next time in pan drippings from cooking chicken which would make the sauce even more flavorful.  I had leftover sauce and ate it the next morning on my bagel and cream cheese -- yummy!
1956	225	It took me longer to prep- I’m not fast with mincing and with measuring several different things, but once I was ready to cook, it was easy!  This was an absolute hit with my teenage children and my husband.     My son said it tasted like something from a restaurant lol.  I will make this again!
1957	225	Rich and savory with just the right amount of sweetness....yummy! I didn't have figs as they are hard to get in Alberta.  Substituted dried apricots and added a bit more honey.
1958	225	Pretty tasty. Did some substituting due to lack of ingredients. Added chicken broth to add to sauce volume.
1959	225	Very tasty. I used chicken thighs sliced to tenders size. Only found dried figs so heated slightly in water to soften. Turned out well.
1960	226	These are not scones. The batter was runny, like cake batter. I added an extra 1/2 C oats, but that did not help.  I used an ice cream scoop to place blobs onto the pan - they ran together.  After baking, these look like big, chewy cookies.  Not scones.  Flavor is fine, but not good enough to want to make these again.
1961	226	Very, very good.
1962	226	While it had great flavor, not easy to bake. Dough too wet even after adding extra flour. Took 20 min just to get it scored without a doughy mess. The edges cooked faster then the middle. Not a technique I’ve ever used when making scones. I will try again with a drier batter and cutting before baking.
1963	226	Wow! These are tasty. I had a scone pan so used that and the cook time was less but they were so yummy!
1964	226	Pretty darn good.  Batter is perfect after the diced figs are added.  Could still taste the fresh fig chunks in these scones
1965	226	only used 2 T of sugar on figs. made it a different time with dark molasses instead of honey. it was good. tasted like gingerbread
1966	226	I enjoyed the flavor of the sweet figs to which I added slivered almonds.  The scones were rather crumbly.
1967	226	I enjoyed the flavor of the sweet figs to which I added slivered almonds.  The scones were rather crumbly.
1968	226	I only had about 1 tsp baking powder left so I used baking soda and corn starch (equal amounts).  I also had to double tHe recipe because I had 2 cups of figs. I used maple syrup in the figs. (The turkey brown figs tasted bitter, I also had black mission figs). It's hard to rate when yoU changed it.  I had to bake it longer too.  I think I may have burned it a little.
1969	227	Use plenty of the oil/balsamic on each piece!
1970	227	Yummy!!!!
1971	227	Oh my.  Never would have done this without the inspiration.  I took it a step further and smeared Burrata on Crostini, topped with Grilled Fig quarters/halves, and drizzled with Balsamic Glaze for a baby shower.  MOST popular - definitely will be doing this again - and the grill mess is a small price to pay.
1972	227	Made exactly as written. Loved the grilled figs! Loved all of it except ... the Burrata cheese was sort of underwhelming. The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such.  This was good, just not quite perfection for me.
1973	227	I made this with fresh figs from the garden.  I did substitute fresh soft mozzarella cheese and used a crusty bread.  Wow, was really nice, well flavored and fast.  Enjoyed it prior to grilling a fillet with fingerling potatoes.
1974	227	So lovely.  I'd never had grilled figs before, but holy whoa, they were DELICIOUS.  I didn't even have a grill--I just used a cast iron skillet.  My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it.  The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild.  Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here.  The figs are what make it.
1975	228	only used 1 cup of sugar and baked in individual Bundt cake pans for 40 min. did not do frosting only dusting of powder sugar.
1976	228	This is a delicious cake. I used a bundt pan the first time and made two dozen muffins with the batter the next time. Used fresh figs in both. No icing either time.  Didn't need it.
1977	228	I'm fortunate that I have nice neighbors who allow me to pick figs from their trees. I made this cake last fig season with the fresh figs and, instead of using the icing recipe, I dusted the top of the cake with 10X sugar. Everyone loved the cake. It's fig season again and I picked a lot this morning. I'll be making the cake again tomorrow.
1978	228	The cake is fabulous, but I did not care for the topping.  I think I will try a cream cheese frosting on the one I have in the oven now.
1979	228	Very good!!  Agree with others:  very moist, tasty, and plenty sweet without icing.  I excluded the icing and followed recipe otherwise except replaced half the oil with apple sauce.  I will make again and will try reducing sugar a bit.
1980	228	Everybody loved this cake!!  I followed the recipe as written, but skipped the icing.
1981	228	So moist and delicious! A huge hit!
1982	228	Yummy! Doesn't even need the icing if you don't want it
1983	228	This cake was delicious I made a few substitutions based on what I had available. I used a jar of figs I canned last year (more than a cup) so I cut the sugar down to a half of a cup of coconut sugar, toasted chopped almonds instead of pecans.. I mixed the figs into the batter quite a bit and added extra nutmeg. We ate it without the frosting and it was moist and well  spiced!
1984	229	I forgot the honey.  I'll try it with honey tomorrow but I did not suffer for the lack of it. Easy and yummy
1985	229	We make a similar version at our house. All the same ingredients minus the honey.  But most important we serve it raw!  I usually cut the prosciutto into strips and wrap around my 1/4 fig with desired amount of goat cheese. I've made them with light and dark figs and plain and herbed cheese. It all comes down to taste. I say skip the oven!
1986	229	Great taste! I whisked honey with equal parts of aged Balsamic vinegar for a sweet/tart finish and, being Greek, I used Feta.
1987	229	6:30 a.m.  Just read this and had fresh figs on my kitchen counter (from my tree).  Also had soft, mild cheese, bacon, honey.  I immediately put everything together being as quiet as possible and enjoyed this little bit of heaven.  And Deeli's honey/vinegar mix is genius!
1988	229	I made this recipe last night for dinner guests and it was a huge hit! Even those who have never had figs or thought they wouldn't like figs loved them. Three minor changes I made were 1) to use Panache Tiger Strip Fig 2) topped with diced thick sliced bacon instead of prosciutto and 3) I didn't drizzle with honey as the figs were juicy and sweet on their own. Truly delicious! Shared the recipe with friends; will definitely make this again.
1989	229	The addition of prosciutto sounds wonderful! Being that my paternal grampa was from Greece I highly recommend trying this recipe with Feta instead of goat cheese ;-) They taste awesome grilled too! One more tip for those who might like to try an additional flavoring is to whisk together an equal amount of honey and red wine vinegar for drizzling.
1990	230	This is delicious. I substituted arugula for the romaine because I like the peppery with the sweet. I used an olive oil/blackberry balsamic vinaigrette. My husband and I both loved it!
1991	230	Delicious!  Used a Balsamic
1992	230	I altered the type of lettuce and cheese used. My husband told me that he didn't like the fresh figs I brought-so I was looking for a different way to present them because we have a fig tree!
1993	230	Great mix of flavors in your mouth , made for easter was a hit!
1994	230	Delightful salad.  I made my own vinaigrette dressing.  Since the dressing is mixed in at the beginning, it probably doesn't serve well a second time, and as such, you may consider serving the dressing on the side unless you're sure it will all be consumed at the first setting.
1995	230	I have to admit I wasn't sure about this salad while reading the recipe.  But for anyone who wonders about the mix, it is wonderful!  We have eaten this salad for the last 3 nights.  We love it!
1996	230	I planned on making this recipe as is, but ended up modifying it a bit.  The grocery store I went to didn't have fresh figs so I used golden raisins instead.  I also accidentally got a blood orange (don't ask me how I didn't notice) but ended up loving it in the salad.  I also substituted arugula for the romaine and added some candied walnuts for a nice crunch.  The combination was delicious!
1997	230	A nice, new salad combination to keep things fresh.
1998	230	I've been eyeing my dad's fig tree waiting to get the perfect fig to make this salad...delicious! I didn't have any fresh oranges, so I used mandarin oranges, and they worked out fine. Topped this w/ raspberry vinaigrette...all of the flavors went wonderfully together. I think next time I'll add a bit of red onion too. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
2299	274	I omitted the olives and red onion and it was  still delicious!
2000	231	*Incomplete review submitted. Here is the full review. I give this 5 stars because it is an excellent “go by” recipe. I used what I had on hand. I rehydrated dried figs and crystallized ginger in some water and port, and then made the preserves from there. It is excellent with sharp cheddar cheese. Next time, I might add some jalapeño.
2001	231	Smells and tastes good, but turned out very thin and watery. I cooked it over 20 minutes and it reached the 100 Celsius but I should have let it simmered longer.  Hope to use it as a sauce.
2002	231	I read the other comments regarding the preserve to be bland. Accordingly, I left the skin/peel on and chopped the figs a bit finer. I did find it to be a bit bland so added 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves. Very nice. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar as well. It turned out beautifully.  Love the recipe and will make it again!
2003	231	I used green figs from my tree...and left the peel. So technically I changed it. But the flavor was wonderful. I love the small batch concept.
2004	231	This was bland for us.  I missed the flavor that comes from the peel.  Texture wise it was perfect!
2005	231	I used 1/2 less sugar in this recipe and it came out perfect.
2006	232	I will be making this again. I think I'll make some Popsicles out of this as well.
2007	232	Perfect for lactose-intolerant folks!
2008	232	this is a fantastic recipe.
2009	232	Flavorful smoothie without the tang of yogurt. I subbed some frozen raspberries for the strawberries and also added a few scoops of protein powder and did not add the figs. Perfect natural sweetness with no additional sweetener required. Thank you Soup Lover-Sue for a nice smoothie recipe!  UPDATE 5/1/20:  Wanting to use up what I had in the freezer, I also added raspberries. Sampling it, I didn't like the texture from the seeds, so I strained the whole thing, and it was better.
2010	232	It's so good and easy. My husband loved it.
2011	232	I used home made cranberry juice to cut some sugar.  Upped the watermelon  and figs  (  6 figs :0) to use them up.
2012	232	I used a large chunked frozen banana and omitted the figs only because we did not have any. Even missing the figs, this smoothie was delicious.
2013	232	This is a lovely summery drink.  I did leave out the figs (personal preference), so I upped the amount of banana.  Thanks, Sue!
2014	233	I grabbed this recipe in a hurry as I had dozens of ripe figs coming off of my trees.  I changed nothing...it was easy and simple and soooo delicious.  I made this tonight and will serve over warm baked brie with crackers as an appetizer tomorrow.  Excellent recipe that we will be making often!
2015	233	The only change I made was to cut sugar back to 1/4 cup as suggested. Also my figs were already super sweet and very ripe. Excellent recipe. I can see how easy it would be to add citrus zest depending on what you are in mood for.
2016	233	added dried orange peel to mixture.
2017	233	Made this per recipe, AWESOME! Very sweet, I served mine over toasted cream cheese and toasted goat cheese. I REALLY liked it over the goat cheese- the sweet figs over the savory goat cheese was amazing on a thin & crispy rosemary cracker. This is my new favorite fig recipe!!!!
2018	233	Too much sugar, imho. Maybe cut sugar in half. Figs are naturally sweet. I would use less water, too. I like that the recipe was purist: no added citrus, nor liqueur.
2019	233	Loved this, delicious!  Followed to a T.  Added 1 T of Fig preserves that I had on hand.  I only did this as not all of my figs were quite 100% ripe, and thought this might help.  It was absolutely delicious.
2020	233	Made as written.
2021	233	I made this with some fresh figs that I got in my Bountiful Basket.  It was the first time I have ever had fresh fig and we LOVED it!  I didn't have any good buttery crackers, so we ended up putting it over vanilla ice cream and it was so good.  I only had a few figs so had to halve the recipe.  I will definitely make this again (when I can get some fresh figs)!
2022	233	Really good! I made the compote the day before and refrigerated it, then when I was ready to use it I poured it over the cream cheese. This would also be great over vanilla ice cream. The figs I had weren't the best, but this recipe made them yummy. I think the brown sugar could even be reduced a bit w/o compromising the flavor. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
2023	234	I had leftover fig and pine nut puree from the Dolce Pesca recipe on this site. Since I happened to have ricotta in the house, this was a perfect way to use it up. I did half with the puree and half with diced figs. On all of them, instead of just putting "a few ribbons" of basil, I covered the whole piece of bread with basil, which I think added a lot of flavor. The ones with the puree had more flavor, held the vinegar better, and you could put a lot more topping than with the diced figs. The diced fig ones were noticeably less flavorful, probably because they didn't hold as much vinegar. If I make this again, I will do the puree, and add the vinegar to the puree instead of drizzling.
2024	234	This is my recipe.  It's important to note that the ricotta should really be fresh ricotta, from a cheese shop, as it has a much different texture than the kind you buy in the dairy case.  Hope you like it!
2025	234	Not as much vinegar!
2026	234	I agree with some others - this is rather bland. Maybe some cinnamon mixed into the ricotta would liven it up?? Any other suggestions welcome as I would like to see this idea work.
2027	234	A delicious, but different appetizer. Also works nicely substituting pears for those anti-fig eaters (what is wrong with them?)
2028	234	Elegant and impressive.  I made these for a family dinner and there were none leftover.  I followed the recipe exactly except I put the figs into a processer and pulsed until chopped fine.  It made this so much easier to eat these two bite crostinis.  Use good balsamic vinegar, it makes all the difference.  LOVED this recipe.
2029	234	Wow! Talk about an easy but impressive appetizer. This blew everyone away.
2030	234	I recommend this to everyone. I just had a cocktail party for 45 people and everyone loved these. The basil leaf sliver added the perfect taste to this.
2031	236	I love this recipe.  We were also at Menwith from 1999-2002.  Jann
2032	236	A big hit at thanksgiving. I reduced the sugar by half but added some maple syrup. Very easy to make.
2033	236	I loved the idea of combining the figs and cranberries. However,  I reduced the amount of brown sugar a bit in order to substitute a good quality maple syrup for the maple extract without making it overly sweet. Will definitely make this again for the holidays!
2034	237	Simple and good tasting. We never have made anything with our figs. This turned out great.
2300	274	Loved this! Slightly reworked the recipe...
2301	275	So delicious!
2035	237	The strawberry jello and lemons made figs taste so much better!  I have a tree full of figs and will be making many more pints of this to last a few seasons.
2036	237	It was very good!  I used Splenda instead of sugar, and sugar-free jello and the recipe cooked up just fine.  With 4 cups of fruit and 4 cups of sweetener, it did not, however, make 3 pints.  I ended up instead with 3 8-oz jelly jars.   I'll make it again, but I'll plan on making larger batches next time.
2037	237	Follow ed recipe except I used cherry jello because thats what I had on hand. Served with hot homemade biscuits.  They were a big hit and loved by all!
2038	237	It turned super thick for us super quick.  I over cooked mine so I thinned it out with a sweet vermouth.  Everyone loved this jam!
2039	237	This is the best fig preserves I have every made.  The preserves have the flavor of the Jell-o, I made strawberry, blackberry, and raspberry. I only used 2 cups of sugar and be sure not to use sugar free Jell-O.
2040	238	I made the recipe exactly as indicated.  My family loved it. I may add a couple more figs next time to increase that flavor. A very savory dish. Will definitely make it again.
2041	239	This was a quick, easy and tasty recipe. The sweet, salty and tartness all blended together so well. We liked it a lot and will be making it again!
2042	239	I really wanted to like this recipe and high hopes. I am a white sauce freak and I love prosciutto. To be fair, I used dried figs (the kind that come in a foil bag, like Sunmaid raisins) because I couldn’t find fresh anywhere. I was surprised my husband said he liked it, but I did not and won’t be making again.
2043	239	The combination of lemon and milk tastes terrible.   The lemon flavor is overpowering, maybe try less to no lemon,  personally staying away from this dish
2044	239	Only two reviews so I feel compelled to leave one.
2045	239	Delicious! I had to make a couple subs based on what I had on hand. I used dates instead of figs and used pre-cooked crumbled bacon - did not use the lemon pepper.  I had doubts about the white sauce as a stand-alone with added zest but it was fantastic. The topping of dates/bacon (in our case) was amazing. So so good. Definitely will make again! Thank you for  such a yummy and creative recipe!
2046	239	Without a doubt the most creative, incredible recipe I've found in forever. The figs, prosciutto, and white sauce with just that touch of lemon make this outstanding. This is a definite keeper, fit for company. Thanks for sharing. I was very impressed.
2047	240	This recipe was easy to follow! I found it was ready after 1.5 hours of cooking and I did use my hand blender to purée the chunks! My family loves it and it’s smooth and easy to spread!
2048	240	We love this fig recipe! We have a tree that produces so many figs that I make a batch every other day! I cut the figs in half because they are a smaller variety and hubs likes the larger chunks. Will be making this for years! Thank you!
2049	240	Grandma would be so proud!  Delicious sweetness made for sharing with family and friends!
2050	241	The flavour is very interesting! I just tried one warm from the oven with a bit of butter and it was very good. I think the cream cheese icing will go perfectly.
2051	241	These turned out fantastic! Great flavors, very unique and moist. I cheated on the icing, used a full tub of cream cheese icing but still beat in the fig mixture....plus a little extra bourbon for more of a kick for card night. Will have to do these every fig season!  Thank you so much for sharing
2052	243	Great flavors, not too heavy. My family loved it.
2053	243	An absolute keeper!!
2054	244	Delicious on crackers with cream cheese.
2055	244	Oh my gosh, this was so good! I could just eat it with a spoon and nothing else! I ended up only using 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes because I wasn't sure how spicy it would be, though next time I think I'll use a a whole tsp, as it wasn't particularly spicy. Once the wine reduced and thickened, I ran everything through my mini food processor, just to make it more spreadable. I served it on table water crackers with mini slices of Dubliner cheese. It was an absolute hit! Everyone raved about it. I can't wait to make it again! Thanks for the recipe!
2056	244	Such a good combination with crackers and mozzarella cheese!
2057	245	Had to use dried figs and cranberries.  Liquid was a bit thick and I didn’t have any more juice so i added a splash of Coke.  My husband is extremely picky.  He enjoyed it!   Served over white rice but would be just as good with buttered egg noodles.
2058	245	The pork chops were very dry! Overall, good flavor. I think next time we will do a pork roast or find more fatty chops. It has the potential to be phenomenal!
2059	245	Delicious! I came across this recipe because I had bought some dried black mission figs for holiday baking, but never used them.  I just added a bit more apple juice, three cloves of garlic (left whole, just kind of smashed) and I used country style pirk ribs.  Very tasty!
2060	245	We like pork with spiced apples so thought we'd try this. Used a pork roast instead of pork chops. Drizzled sauce over slices. it was really pretty and tasted soooo good! cooked on low for 6 hrs. Thank you Krista.
2061	246	9.1.18  My figs were very ripe, and I was concerned that if I put them in the blender, they’d turn to mush, so I chopped them as well as the pine nuts.  Honestly, I did use the ingredients in the recipe, but I didn’t measure, just eyeballed everything.  Definitely would roast the pine nuts in the future, but the nut-fig filling on the nectarines (yes, I used nectarines, not peaches) was very good. Super simple to make with nice presentation, actually a little elegant in its simplicity.
2062	246	Really flavorful, but we topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (husband) and/or a spoonful of greek yogurt (me).  Perfect.  Next time I dont think I will process the pine nuts and figs in the food processor, though.  Needs a little contrasting texture and crunch.
2063	246	Holy moly this was good! Needed to find a way to use the fresh figs I had picked at my best friend's house. The combination was wonderful. I didn't use the food processor to grind up the figs and pine nuts, just cause I didn't have one available to me...but I think that it gave it a great textural element. Next time I might toast the nuts prior to combining them with the figs. Thank you Laura for sharing this recipe; this was a great way to end our Italian feast.
2064	246	I used nectarines instead of peaches. I liked the baked nectarines in the alcohol, but not the topping. If I make it again, I will reduce the amount of nuts and add a little honey to the topping. Also, based on DILLORDONEZ's review, I cut the alcohol in half, and it was still too much, so I'd cut it down even more.
2065	246	Absolutely delicious. Next time, though, I'll cut the alcohol by a lot. It was way more than needed and I felt like I was just wasting good wine.
2066	247	I made this smoothie with peach yogurt, blueberries, almond milk, ice and of course cantaloupe.   Couldn't believe how tasty it was.  All ingredients used was what I had on hand.
2067	247	Delicious I added one right banana
2068	247	It is easy to make.  Though I would add more cantaloupe. Love it.
2069	247	A great way to get rid of leftover cantaloupe. I made it with just greek yogurt and cantelope with a tiny bit of lime juice to substitute the orange juice.
2070	247	Added strawberries
2071	247	Super good!
2072	247	It is a very good smoothie to wake up with!
2073	247	It was delicious, though it was a little too cold for me.
2074	247	I used orange Greek yogurt and milk because that’s what I had, and it was delicious!
2075	248	Wow so refreshing and easy to make! Made this for the fourth of July and it was delish!!!
2076	248	Insanely good! I think I might get addicted to this. I skipped the part where you heat up the water. I just added the sugar straight to the watermelon and lemon juice mixture, and it dissolved quickly enough.
2077	248	I guess our watermelon wasn't as sweet as yours... ours didn't need any water!!!
2078	248	Easy and very yummy. We used it for Vodka also, or just plain juice.  I did not strain it so I could get the full benefit of the pulp. I used a hand mixer
2079	248	This was not too sweet for my family as some of the reviews have said. I pureed the watermelon until I had 4 cups of watermelon though, so I may have used significantly more than intended which may have cut the sweetness. Its perfect, however, so I’d make it again the same way if and when I do make it again.
2080	248	It is hard to make this if you want to make like a whole gallon of it, because this tells you to put it into individual cups. But other than that it’s great!
2081	248	I don't know what the vodka would make the drink taste like. I think it's good as is.
2082	248	I used Meyers lemons and added an extra one. I did strain the melon purée but not sure that is necessary. I mixed altogether and poured over ice .  Added mint sprig too. Awesome!
2083	248	I used sparkling lemon water in place of regular cold water, and served the whole concoction in the hull of the watermelon I used for the drink. It was awesome!
2084	249	I didn’t use any water as the watermelon was watery enough. Used lime juice instead of lemon. Very tasty.
2085	249	sorry, I followed the recipe exactly but didn't think these were that good. the lemon separates from the rest of the mix, going to the bottom of the mold in the freezer so that when you eat it, you get nothing but a sort of lemon honey flavor the first 1/3 of the popsicle.
2086	249	Thank you, this came out great.
2087	249	Easy to make...
2088	249	I used especially sweet watermelon but still put in the honey. My family LOVED this and asked me to make more.
2089	249	This came out great next time I will use a little less honey and sugar just for my tastebuds
2090	249	I just made this recipe 2 days ago and my girls loved it. I had to Google it again today hoping and praying that I would find it and I did! It is now saved as a favorite :) I'm sure I'll be making a lot of this during this summer. Thank you
2091	249	It was easy and taste great! It’s an awesome way to use up watermelon. Thank you for sharing.
2092	249	Very simple to make because of readily available ingredients.  I didn't have any lemons so used lime instead but they turned out great!  My kids love them!
2093	250	This was outstanding! I did make a few substitutions because of what I had on hand. I subbed the feta for goat cheese and used an apricot White balsamic vinegar. This will be my go to summer salad.
2094	250	Awesome salad!  This is a keeper!  Letting it rest in the fridge for several hours will make it meld and taste even better!
2095	250	Awesome salad!  This is a keeper!  Letting it rest in the fridge for several hours will make it meld and taste even better!
2096	250	Delicious! I just added more mint and used cherry tomatoes.
2097	250	This is a new family fav!  Everyone liked it and asked for seconds or the recipe.  I did make one small change.  I swapped out fresh Thai basil for the mint.
2098	250	Great combination!  I used green onions, rather than a sweet onion.  Did not have mint on hand, but I imagine that would make it even better!
2099	250	Made a smaller amount for two, and we ate it all!  The only change was dark balsamic vinegar--not as pretty, but as good.
2100	250	Super tasty! I used fresh basil and a pinch of dried mint leaves.
2101	250	I used lemon cucumber vinegar; it was delicious and well-received by our guests. Definitely will make again!
2102	251	This is more of a melon slurry than a smoothie....there's nothing smooth about it.  I made this with honey instead of the sugar and slightly less as honey is sweeter. However it was still too sweet, and the lime gave it a weird sour taste. I tried adding water, which turned it into a cooler/agua fresca but it still had a strange puckery taste. I used the other half of my melons to make a "milky melon" smoothie by simply adding a cup of coconut milk and it tasted much better...creamy like a real smoothie!
2103	251	Absolutely delicious! Prepared exactly as described and I will definitely make again and again! Thanks for the awesome recipe!
2104	251	This was really refreshing! I used a melon ballet and then froze them. The finished product was way too thick to drink, so I added some water. It was wonderful and my kids liked it too. Thanks for sharing!
2105	251	Delicious! I halved the sugar because my fruit was pretty ripe and used a splash of lime juice because I didn't have a fresh lime on hand. Will make this one over and over.
2106	251	The recipe is perfect. It has a great taste and I would recommend it to anyone with leftover melon.
2107	251	Pretty good. The lime decreased the sweetness. It wasn't necessary nor did it make the smoothie taste bad.
2108	251	I do not like cantaloupe, but I loved this recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing!!
2109	251	My goodness, this had so much flavor for so few ingredients. This is a wonderful go-to recipe whenever guest come over... or not. I think I will also try to freeze this as popcicles for my dear children.
2110	251	So refreshing! I made it without adding sugar and added ginger instead.
2111	252	I felt like the recipe was more of a smoothie, so I made a few revisions-
2112	252	Ok, so after reading a bunch of reviews I decided to try a few different things.
2113	252	I tweaked the recipe...I used just a dash of milk because watermelon makes it's own juice ...and little less sugar..is a very good smoothie.
2114	252	I tweaked the recipe...I used just a dash of milk because watermelon makes it's own juice ...and little less sugar..is a very good smoothie.
2115	252	Really good! Added 1 cup ice cubes and it was a little thicker
2116	252	Not much flavor and runny. Don't think I will make it again.
2117	252	its nice
2118	252	Three stars meaning "Good, but average" in my book, I found this not quite up to that. It is watery with not much flavor, and certainly not what one would expect from the title - therefore, two stars if prepared strictly sticking to the recipe.  I guess a good word for it might be "wimpy." So I made it a second time, this time substituting strawberry yogurt for the milk, adding more watermelon than called for, and a handful of ice cubes.  Still thinner, of course, than what one would consider a milkshake, but much improved - very refreshing, not too sweet  and with a lot more flavor.  Four stars with the tinkering.
2119	252	Yummy!
2120	253	After reading other reviews, I also cut down the sugar to about 1/3 cup. After cooking the simple syrup, I tossed in Thai lemon basil to steep while it cooled. Then strained the syrup into my blender with the cubes of watermelon and lemon juice. I am lucky enough to to have an ice cream/sorbet machine, so I processed then chilled in freezer. The color and flavor were wonderful! We have several types of watermelon in the garden. We will be feasting on this all summer!
2121	253	I was worried at first when it wasn’t freezing up. But after the 20 minutes in the ice cream freezer it was perfect. I used only half of the sugar and it was just right. Maybe a little more lemon juice next time.
2122	253	I was worried at first when it wasn’t freezing up. But after the 20 minutes in the ice cream freezer it was perfect. I used only half of the sugar and it was just right. Maybe a little more lemon juice next time.
2123	253	The only change I made was to put it in a container into the chest freezer, set the timer for an hour, take it out and mix it up, return it to the freezer and repeat two times, then let it freezer over night.  Turned out yummy!
2124	253	Great way to use leftover watermelon.  Agree with others about the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup but will cut it down even more next time.
2125	253	Rather than adding a cup of sugar I added a half cup of honey.  It was great!
2126	253	Cut back the sugar to a bit less than 1/4 cup.....was too sweet.  2nd time was perfect. And, added bonus ? No sugar crazy
2127	253	Turned out well.  My food processor worked better to puree the chunks of watermelon than the blender.
2128	253	It's a nice basic recipe and while I halved the sugar, the flavor is good. The only thing I'd suggest is, after sitting in the freezer overnight, bring it out to let it thaw just a bit, (maybe 10 minutes), before serving. Mine was like very dry snow, until it melted just a bit.
2129	254	Awesome!!  Delicious, refreshing summer salad!The mint was a great accent flavor & I threw in some kalamata olives.  Made it last night  & it was gone!I still had everything needed except feta, so I made it again today, with crumbled blue cheese…just as yummy!  This is already a new favorite, thank you!!
2130	254	Boring.  I was really excited to try this but it really lacked anything special.
2131	254	Great summer salad! Everyone had seconds and thirds . The mint and  lime juice made this salad uniquely delicious. I served it on bed of spring salad mix for bulk and used the juices from tossing the watermelon as a dressing! Yum.  I let the salad sit for 20 minutes after last toss for the flavors to meld. Thanks for the recipe.
2132	254	Brought to a picnic everyone loved itI used fresh basil leaves instead of mint
2133	254	I cut the watermelon in half, otherwise it would be too much watermelon. When I was done, the flavor was not good. I used fresh mint out of my garden, and bought the veggies at the market this morning, so it wasn't the ingredients. The lime just didn't pull it all together, I agree with other users that it clashed. I had to make a vinegarette to fix it.
2134	254	Very easy to make and it’s delicious! Light and refreshing.
2135	254	Super tasty and easy on a hot day!
2136	254	Everyone in the family likes all the ingredients but none of us cared for the flavor combination. I followed the recipe except for substituting goat cheese for the feta because that's what I had on hand. I wanted to like this salad but can't.
2137	254	Excellent light salad perfect for the hot summer. I bruised the mint leaves before chopping.
2138	255	Super refreshing! - I skipped the Feta altogether, (though about using Gorgonzola) … shaved the red onions super thin, used half Lime and half Lemon juice,  ...and for SURE a large drizzle of Olive Oil! (Makes it more of a 'proper' salad in my opinion)…and, having the watermelon well-chilled prior to assembling will be beneficial.
2139	255	Delicious!!!! Made it for a dear friend's birthday party and it was a hit. Used key lime juice.
2140	255	Not sure lime juice did anything. Maybe vinegar would be better. But still a good recipe. Had to downsize to 3 servings, due to watermelon available, and we’re only two. REALLY ODD measurements, hubby winged it!
2141	255	Refreshing. Go easy on the onions.  It overpowered the watermelon.
2142	255	Dinner’s Ready!
2143	255	Delicious and refreshing! I followed this recipe exactly as written and it turned out great. Wonderful variety of flavors that compliment each other. NOTE: Marinating the onions in the lime juice is an important step. I will definitely be making this again.
2144	255	Yum! This made a refreshing and light side to BBQ  burgers.  I used fresh basil instead of cilantro because a friend gave me a bag full from her garden. I will definitely make again and try it with the cilantro.
2145	255	I've made this recipe a few times now and it is a perfect salad during summer gatherings!
2146	255	Perfect as is. Too bad some guests don’t have adventurous taste buds.
2147	256	An easy fresh summer salad
2148	256	I wasn't sure what to expect with the combination of ingredients, but I really liked this! I scaled it down to a smaller serving and did not have a chance to let it chill as indicated. After sampling it, I gave it an additional sprinkle of salt and chili powder for more kick. Nice lunch on a hot summer day. Thanks for the recipe!
2149	256	Delicious summer salad, the added kick of cayenne pepper is tasty.
2150	256	I substituted Tajin for the salt and chili powder and used yellow watermelon for a pretty and delicious salad!
2151	256	Easiest recipe but so tasty!!  I probably used more basil then needed.....I looooooove basil...do not be afraid of the chili. Gives it just a hint of spicy which is countered by the sweet basil and watermelon.  Salt... I just ground pink Himalayan over it I didn’t measure. Awesome summer treat!  Thanks for recipe!
2152	256	7.21.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254422/watermelon-basil-salad/ ... Ya know how you like some foods separately, but not together?   I was hesitant to try this recipe because of that.  Watermelon had to go.  Fresh basil outside.  O-kay, I'll try.  What a surprise!  The spiciness was subtle; basil wasn't overpowering.  A really good blend of flavors without taking away from the watermelon.  Thanks!
2153	256	I followed the quantities exactly.  You absolutely have to like salt on your watermelon to like this.  My husband loved it.  I couldn't eat it.
2154	256	What a great combination
2155	256	7.7.16  Had a chilled mini melon in the fridge, so decided to give this a go for lunch today.  The combination of basil with that little bit of lemon, chili powder and kosher salt is almost magical.  And at 10 calories, go ahead and eat your heart out.  WOW, loved it!
2156	257	We loved it; I served it as a steak side dish.  It accompanies well the steak with its  flavour, freshness, and texture
2157	257	This is a great recipe! The only difference in how I made it was I omitted the coriander, only because I didn't have any. This recipe has a fantastic sweet taste with a spicy finish. Yum! Thank you for the super easy and great tasting recipe.
2158	257	Loved this ! Spicy and refreshing!
2159	257	7.21.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/233285/spicy-watermelon/ ... Chili-flavored watermelon.  Yeah, it does seem obvious.   Three steps of flavor:  Oh.  Melon.  Huh.  'Mild level of spice  Leftovers get slimy so just be aware.  :)
2160	257	Four cups of watermelon not two! This recipe makes enough seasoning for a whole personal watermelon.
2161	257	Tried it but also used other fruits as that is how I used to buy it in Nogales, AZ.  Besides watermelon, try papaya, strawberries, cantaloupe, mango, raspberries, and jicama.
2162	257	So good! Very refreshing!
2163	257	Sorry, we didn't care for this. I'm a huge fan of chili lime (Tajin seasoning) on fruit - mango, pineapple, melon - it's one of my favorite snacks, so I thought for sure I'd like this. The cumin was overpowering and the combination of lime with the spices gave everything a bitter flavor.  I tried the next bowl without lime and that was better. A sprinkle of salt improved it. If I make this again, I'd definitely leave out the cumin, and possible the coriander too.
2164	257	Neither the children nor the adults liked this at all.
2165	258	absolutely LOVE! I got distracted and let it run too long in my churn so it melted again, but I went with the granita method and it is FABULOUS!! Thank you :)
2166	258	This was easy to make and it's tastes great. I used ¾ of a personal watermelon. It's sweet but also refreshing.
2167	258	This recipe was incredible. I didn't have any gelatin so I left it out. Still fabulous. Next time I will half the sugar and double the lemon. The watermelon is plenty sweet as is.
2168	258	I doubled the recipe and just fit into my electric ice cream maker.  It was awesome!
2169	258	I made this just using my home deep freeze and it turned out great! I will make this again by popular request
2170	258	This was good but not great. Maybe I was expecting the wow of the reviews but it was very sweet and not a lot of favor. I didn’t taste the lemon at all. I was hoping for a lighter fruit flavor but it is  a creamier flavor. I’m going to try it with raspberries and lime and see what happens
2171	258	Hmmmm.... not sure what went wrong! Tasted delicious, but did not harden in my KitchenAid Ice Cream maker. I followed the directions; only change was to cut the sugar to 3/4c instead of the full 1cup. I’m guessing two things: I had heavy cream and had frozen it to use later. Perhaps it doesn’t whip once thawed (?) Or it was because my ice cream maker wasn’t cold enough - it was only in freezer for 3-4 hours. I also tried putting it thru the VitaMix, but that just made a really good smoothie!  It tasted great, so I’ll try it again.
2172	258	So delicious and refreshing! I did half the amount of sugar as my watermelon was very sweet. Turned out perfect!
2173	258	I made it without an ice cream machine. It was great, I stirred it after 45 minutes, than 30 and 30. My only comment beside that it tasted great is that it's a bit on the sweet side, did it like the recipe with cream and 1 cup of sugar. Will reduce the sugar next time....and might add a bit of lemon zest....
2174	259	This is a company favorite and a nice twist on the original.  To try another twist, substitute mint leaves for the basil.  It is outstanding.
2175	259	Easy & delicious.
2176	259	Great recipe for social distancing.  I used balsamic glaze and it came out wonderfully. Perfect summer app.
2177	259	Made as directed and it turned out great. Very impressive looking little bites!
2178	259	I’d thicken the balsamic vinegar...maybe a reduction would be nice, so when I squirted it on finished skewers, it might make a defined line instead of draining off.
2179	259	Light and refreshing. Salt is a must. I may try this with a slice of jalapeño as well
2180	259	Love this recipe! It was my first time using watermelon instead of tomatoes. Very refreshing and everyone enjoyed it.
2181	259	This was very good and refreshing! And for a non-tomato eater I was finally able to enjoy a caprese appetizer. :-)
2182	259	Everyone loved it.  Great new take an old favorite for a summer BBQ.
2183	260	I too left out the honey, doubled the watermelon used lime, added a pinch of salt and sour cream. Delicious!
2184	260	I too left out the honey, doubled the watermelon used lime, added a pinch of salt and sour cream. Delicious!
2185	260	My husband and I love this soup. Perfect on a hot summer day. It's easy to make and delicious. Please follow the recipe and don't skip the mint!
2186	260	Very refreshing!  Subbed 1 T lime juice for 1 T lemon juice - delicious.
2187	260	Simple and tasty
2188	260	Not what I expected. It’s really minty.
2189	260	My family enjoyed this soup.  The  cucumber flavor comes through so don't add any extra you may have cut up.
2190	260	I'm glad I used seedless watermelon.
2191	260	I made it twice! Everyone loved it and commented how light and refreshing it was. Said reminded them of "cruise soups". Delicious
2192	261	So easy to make and delicious! Tastes like summer.
2193	261	Used all baby spinach instead of arugula-Everybody loved it and wanted more!-
2194	261	This did the trick for watermelon feta salad. There are a lot to choose from. Did not have arugula so I just used Romain. Added a little fresh mint. Rinsed the onions, but not sure if that was necessary. I just didn’t want over powering onion flavor.
2195	261	love it!
2196	261	Lots of summer flavor.  Don't mix together until you are ready to eat.  It doesn't last long, so don't make extras.  (It gets very watery.)
2197	261	Love a savory watermelon salad!
2198	261	Really good. I did not have white balsamic vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and a pinch of sugar as a substitute.  I would make this again.
2199	261	I used only half the onion and that was plenty.  Husband and daughter loved it.  Dressing is just the right amount, not too much like in many salad recipes.
2200	261	This was a good lunch campaign.  I used Italian Salad Dressing, and I added some pineapple chunks and Honey Roasted Almonds with Cranberries.
2201	262	Delicious, easy and refreshing
2202	262	I've made this twice so far, using a good quality regular balsamic vinegar (that's all I had) and chopped romaine lettuce.  Delicious.    Note that if not using arugla, which doesn't wilt as quickly as a lettuce, make sure you add the lettuce just before serving or you'll end up with a mushy salad like I did the first time I made it.  Tasted great, just didn't look very appealing.  Excellent recipe!
2203	262	Very good refreshing and filling salad.  Like other reviewers I used a bag of spring mix greens instead of arugula and crumbled feta.  Also, I couldn't find "white" balsamic vinegar so I used "DeLallo Golden Balsamic Style Vinegar".  I thought the dressing was a little bland so the next time I will add more vinegar and maybe add some diced cukes or zucchini and kalamata olives..
2204	262	Delicious salad! Followed the recipe but used champagne vinegar instead of white balsamic vinegar.  It was a big hit for my Sunday night family dinner! This will be a staple for now on!
2205	262	I had a small amount of a yellow pepper that I needed to use up and spinach instead of arugula. Taking it to a potluck so we will see how it goes over. Smells really good though
2206	262	We tried this an it is a very refreshing summer salad and very tasty.  Would recommend it if you are looking for a different summer salad!
2207	262	Very refreshing on a hot summer afternoon. the red onion adds a welcome slight tang balanced by the sweetness of the feta and watermelon. Only slight changes made was used central market baby spring mix (instead of all arugala), and didn't have white basalmic, so I riffed and used some Sprouts brand regular red balsamic and mixed in some Pompeian white white wine vinegar.  Pretty sure my Doc would approve of this as part of a legit "Mediterranean" diet meal.
2208	262	I've made this before but instead of feta cheese I used halloumi cheese. U slice it and pan fry it to brown. It doesn't melt. Serve it warm on the salad and watermelon. Nice contrast. Also added fresh mint leaves which is great with watermelon.  It will get watered down if it sits, so eat as much as u can.
2209	262	No changes. Delicious combination! Many thanks!
2210	263	I made this recipe as directed and really enjoyed this cool, refreshing margarita. It's important to use the white tequila (also know as bianca) for the full margarita effect. Gold tequila is smoother and sweeter.  You don't want to add sweetness to the already sweet watermelon.  Additionally I recommend salting the rims of your glasses over sugar.  The salt helps to mellow the sweetness and intensify the watermelon flavor.  Salud!
2211	263	Da BOM.COM.  To keep it simple my hubby threw 4 cups (for a double recipe) of scraped-out watermelon into a big blender with the syrup (made with erythritol/monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar BTW!), 3 cups of ice, the lime juice and the tequila, and blended.  DELICIOUS and LETHAL!!!
2212	263	I didn't have tequila on hand but I did have rum so I guess I made watermelon "daquiritas."  I froze my watermelon cubes like all the others said and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  This was fabulous so thanks for planting that (watermelon) seed in my head, JEWEL!!  These are bomb!
2213	263	AMAZING!!!
2214	263	I find these quite sweet.  I used 1/2 of the simple syrup and will try 1/4 next time.  Served on the rocks.
2215	263	I didn't add the simple syrup to save calories, but added more watermelon instead. It was still very good.
2216	263	I would add about half as much sugar or maybe none at all. I blitzed in a food processor and then filtered through a fine colander for more of a “watermelon juice” consistency. I can see why some people preferred to freeze the fruit and make this more like a slushie - I think that’s the way to go if you want to keep the pulp. I had a watermelon I wasn’t totally happy with because it had way too gritty a texture, so I was looking for a cocktail to use juice only. Pretty good but just a tad too sweet for me.
2217	263	Loved it!  Easy and delish!
2218	263	These are insanely good exactly as the recipe stands. It is a lot of sugar fur me so I’m going to try to use Splenda and see what happens. It is really fantastic tho just as is.
2219	264	Followed to the T....but it candied. Tastes good, tho.
2220	264	I would suggest throwing the melon and lemon into the blender to liquefy it prior to cooking? Maybe that would have helped. I ended up with two pint jars of thick weird textured product. I added ginger for flavor that did make it taste better, but still weirdest creation I ever made. I would not recommend it.
2221	264	I used my electric pressure cooker (2 hours on stew (I checked the temp after the first cycle 220 exactly)  to cook the melon and lemon and I used darker natural sugar.   I’ve heard the smell is meh they are right but tastes great!    Next time I’ll add fresh mint as well.
2222	264	Thinking of trying it with strawberries in it too.
2223	264	Please forgive, I haven't made this yet.  Dad was the expert on tasting watermelon rind preserves: his sister Orene always won the blue ribbon, ergo his opinion was accurate.  Pappy (granddad, a farmer) was famous for the best watermelons in New Albany Mississippi area.  Dad:  Rind has to be thick but tender with no green left on - green parts cook up tasteless and leathery.  Which is extremely hard to find because those traits mean melons don't ship well (break easily) and were bred out of fruit in commerce now.   Pappy's melons were so intensely flavored you'd dream of them all winter!  Their rinds trimmed of all green and pink were over 1" thick and snow white.  Today rinds are thin, tough as nails, greenish.  Farmers tell me to hunt out seeded watermelons, especially heirloom types, which are the sweetest and best tasting anyway.  Farmers have to grow some to pollinate seedless ones.  Also, Dad said lemon spoils the flavor completely.  Orene didn't use it.   The flavor should be reminiscent of citron.  Factoid:  a white meat watermelon was grown in the south just for it's rind which was candied and used as a substitute for more expensive citron.  Dad passed 1 year ago, age 96.
2224	264	Did not set, stayed syrup.  Fruit flavor did not come through, I only taste a sweet/slightly burnt taste.  Maybe try another recipe that doesn't cook the fruit so long, and uses pectin.
3537	428	I loved this salad! The flavors were absolutely perfect blended together. Yummy!!!
2225	264	The watermelon tasted like burnt squash after being cooked. (it wasn't actually burned) . The added lemon and sugar did little to flavor it.  I would add a flavored gelatin to boost the flavor and add a little thickness to the gel.
2226	264	My watermelon stayed in chunks that are pretty solid and don't spread like preserves should. I'd suggest finely dicing or pureeing before cooking. I used two lemons and the whole recipe got quite bitter from the rinds - next time I will only use lemon juice and zest. Otherwise, the jam set pretty well after two hours on a low-ish boil. Other reviews say to boil only 1 hour but mine was still soupy liquid at that point. Overall, I'm glad it worked, but I'm not exactly looking forward to eating all this chunky, bitter preserve.
2227	264	Is definitely more marmalade like than a preserve. I found previous reviews very helpful. We halved the lemon as suggested and added 2 small velencia oranges with rinds. Leave uncovered during simmer to reduce until desired thickness. Our first batch produced 3 half pints. The fruit did not break down and the final product is very chunky with bits of candied watermelon among the rind pieces. Overall, very good but the recipe is missing many important elements and hints. Thank u previous reviewers, very helpful.
2228	265	I've made this salad quite a few times. It's a hit every single time.
2229	265	This recipe is a crowd winner and it is so easy! I can't tell you how many times I've had to copy the link and send to friends.
2230	265	I liked it-but did not love it.
2231	265	It was terrible tasting after I added the basil
2232	265	Cut back the herbs to half and skipped the olive oil, perfect!
2233	265	Made it because had way too much watermelon. My boyfriend and I loved t! Refreshing and healthy too. Made as written except didn't have cilantro...it doesn't need it. I will definitely make this over and over again.
2234	265	Added baby spinach (because I didn't have basil leaves and we don't like cilantro). I also added strawberries and grapes. I would wait until just before serving to add the dressing (that I added a few strawberries to) which was the star of the show. (The greens will wilt otherwise)
2235	265	I did not follow your recipe exactly but it came out great!  Thanks for the inspiration
2236	265	I was skeptical as to how it would taste. I’ve heard many reviews and seen several variations of this salad.  A quick taste test before I packed it to go and I was seriously amazed. This salad is dynamite! Just made it for my mother in-laws birthday cookout. I will be making this again. So easy and was able to use fresh herbs from my garden
2237	266	We made this for my kids' Geography club. It was more pulp than drink. We followed the recipe exactly. It was so thick and not as flavorful as you'd think.
2238	266	My husband is Tongan. We make the "skinny version". Using ripe watermelon, take out the seeds( if necessary) & place chunks in the blender. Add at least 2 cups of unsweetened vanilla almond milk & blend to the consistency that you like. It is a nice low calorie treat on a hot summer day!
2239	266	Wow! This tasted great! I bought a really sweet but visually unattractive watermelon inside so decided to use this recipe. I didn't have coconut so I left it out. As soon as I go to the store, I'll have to get shredded coconut to make more.
2240	266	I love this Drink, My Tongan Friend Mele gave me her recipe for Otai, I make it every summer, I make it by the gallons for all my friends to enjoy when they come to visit.In stead of can milk we used Half& Half, you can also use mango instead of watermelon, for adults you can add some rum or brandy.
2241	266	i love this recipe and make it every weekend over he summer , but i like to use primo milk instead of water to give it a milky taste and serve it with ice cream . . . yummy
2242	266	Mine came out... okay. I bought a seedless watermelon, cut it in half and started with that. I blended it and the can of crushed pineapple, added the milk, lime juice, coconut milk (I don't care for flakes in my drinks), water, and evaporated milk. It was thick. VERY thick. So I added the second half of watermelon (blended). Added more water. Added pineapple juice. Still thick. So I strained all of it, and got it to a liquid stated. By that point, it was lime heavy (I don't know how), so I added the sugar (1/2 cup). It's finally to the point that I don't mind drinking it. It was just a lot more work than I thought and VERY time consuming.
2243	266	Made this for an island inspired graduation party. I used really sweet watermelon and delicious, fresh pineapple (crushed it). I followed the recipe to the tee and no one liked it at all. I really expected a quite different turn out. Maybe adding some ginger ale might help?
2244	266	Absolutely delicious! Didn't have coconut so added a can of coconut cream and substitued coconut water for some of the water. Whizzed the fruit with my stick blender. And my husband drank almost all of this great, refreshing drink (I mae it for me, he DOESN'T like fruit drinks!)!
2245	266	Only one star?  This is fabulous!  Very refreshing.  Use as much watermelon as you would like.
2246	267	I liked the simplicity in making it. Just cut up the my favorite fruit that I had in the refrigerator. I used the suggested amount of each fruit. I think the honey and lemon juice topped it off.
2247	267	Didn’t have all of the fruits, so substituted several things.  I did have the watermelon, blackberries, strawberries.  What makes this work is the dressing and the mint.  It was wonderful.  If you don’t have all of the fruits, no worries - put what you have in there.  Keep the dressing and mint the same.  I loved it and will definitely make again.
2248	267	The mint was nice for a change from the traditional fruit salad.  Not a replacement of the traditional recipe but adds a tasty option.
2249	267	A great, colorful fruit salad.  I used Honeydew instead of Watermelon.  I left out the peaches since the white peaches i bought we too hard.  I added 2 Kiwi and used a full lemon's zest.  Finally I added a champagne mango.  The whole salad was enjoyed at a brunch today with 13 people.  Will do this again!
2250	267	Oh no! This was perfect ! My family loved it. Definitely will make it more often & for other occasions.
2251	267	I changed up the fruit (used watermelon, blueberries, honeydew melon, strawberries and white peaches), made the dressing as written using mint from our garden, and this was a hit at dinner! Delicious
2252	267	I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.   Especially good during this hot season.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.
2253	267	You select your favorite fruits. the flavor is really brought together by the syrup. I used watermelon, pineapple, strawberries, and blackberries. I mixed residual watermelon juice  with the syrup and it gave a wonderful flavor. Super refreshing. It was a hit at the dinner party.
2254	267	I didn't use the same combination of fruits. I had watermellow, strawberries, blueberries and pineapple. It was fine, we took it to a summer block party and it vanished. Everyone liked the honey lemon and mint dressing.
2255	268	I made this for a friend’s birthday “cake” and she loved it. It doesn’t take any longer to make than plain fruit salad. The results are worth the time.
2256	268	This "100% Fruit Cake" was a huge hit! I made mine 3 hours in advance and placed it in a pie plate by chance because I was taking it to a picnic. A lot of fruit juice seeped from the fruit, but fortunately the edges of the pie plate caught the excess fruit juice so I didn't have a big mess. I just "drank away" the excess juice with a straw. From now on when I make this recipe I will place the cake in my flan pan both to catch the juices and so I can stack up lots of fruit for garnish. Thank you InTheKitchen for sharing your recipe.
2257	268	I make mine a little differently, but same concept. I cut the ends off the watermelon leaving the center flat on both sides, remove the rind to form an actual cake shaped watermelon and then decorate with other fruit using toothpicks to secure the pieces that need to stay in place.  For the leaves, flowers, stars or other shapes I use cookie cutters or just a paring knife.
2258	268	This was a great alternative to the traditional cake.  However, don't let it fool you, it isn't as easy as it looks!  Worth the effort though.
2259	268	Made it for my friends little brother, hes 6 and loved it. Thanks for the recipe :3
2260	268	laysho!
2261	269	Deliciously refreshing watermelon drink! I will make this again and again. Really liked the lime.  Tasty! Thanks
2262	269	We had a watermelon agua fressca at a street fair on a hot day and it was the best thirst quencher. I looked up a recipe right away. Did not add sugar for our batch - we were very happy with the beverage.
2263	269	the first time , no changes, second time I added blueberry. and I LOVED it!!
2264	269	This was particularly great chilled!
2265	269	So refreshing! Definitely needs to adjust the sugar, depending on how sweet your melon is. I will make this again!
2266	269	I loved this! Substituted the sugar with Splenda. Mixed the liquids up in the blender, then added ice cubes. Continued blending until slushie-like consistency. Next time would like to see if adding mint will boost the flavor more.
2267	269	It's hard to know how many stars to give this recipe because the flavor seems to depend totally on the sweetness of your watermelon. Mine wasn't sweet. We had not eaten it, and rather than just throw it away, I decided to try this recipe. I cut the recipe in half but then ended up adding twice the lime juice and three times the sugar. So I guess you just need to go by taste. My husband loved it.
2268	269	I saw a note in Family Circle where you could sub 3 T of agave nectar for the sugar. Stir in 2 sliced limes.
2269	269	Sugar not necessary at all.  I use a nutribullet or high quality blender to break down all watermelon chunks. Fresh lime juice and a touch of fine grated ginger and/or fresh mint make exquisite refreshing drink that can be stored in fridge for the day.
2270	270	I added mint to mine, and used lime juice instead of lemon to make the vinaigrette. Pretty delish!
2271	271	the picture is different from the recipe. the picture shows bananas and kiwi, and they are not in the recipe.
2272	271	Didn't add banana. Was really good for a hot day and it also served a dual role made fruit rum drink's with it to sip on in the clubs pool!!!
2273	271	I had tons of fruit leftover from this recipe so be prepared to be able to feed twenty plus people.  It was really hot so I froze the watermelon which was just perfect when it was time to put the food out.
2274	271	good
2275	271	Great recipe... but not easy to cut! Had to have my hubby do it! Ha!
2276	271	Loved this recipe! I did use less lemon zest, only about 1 tablespoon. I also added kiwi and cherries. It makes a lot of fruit but it is still good the next day.
2277	271	Blueberries are a great addition!
2278	271	I've been making watermelon baskets for a great number of years.  The only variation is the decision about which fruits to include. I do not add syrup, sugar or any sweetener to the fruit in the basket.  I let the succulent tastes go for themselves.  It is always a hit at an affair - especially during the summer months.  I'm making one in a few days for my church's 131st anniversary!
2279	271	Yummy!
2280	272	This is such a refreshing drink!!! I'm not gonna lie, the 2nd time I made this I added a little moonshine to it, and it was still amazing. My new go-to summer drink!!! 10/10 recommend. I added lime zest to the mix.
2281	272	Do not use bitter cucumbers. Taste first. Try small pickling or English cucumbers.
2282	272	I left out the lime and put mangos & dark cherries.  Real good with lots of ice.
2283	272	more lime juice
2284	272	It was surprisingly good!
2285	272	Loved it. Tried a glass first with just a little salt and pepper added. Great. Then I added a shot of vodka. Even better.
2286	272	Awful. Love watermelon, love cucumber. Something about this drink just does not work.
2287	272	Great juice - one of my favourites! Really refreshing and the lime is such a nice touch. Enjoy!
2288	272	This is so yummy and refreshing, my new addiction!!!
2289	273	This tastes like blended up melon :) I don’t know what I was expecting?? I wonder if a filter step might make it more “juice” like and a bit lighter.
2290	273	Refreshing and so light tasting!  I made with cantaloupe instead, as that is what I had.  I also substituted mango juice for part of the water. 5 Star drink for our girl's luncheon!!!
2291	273	Refreshing, refreshing, refreshing!!! It is delicious and because the honeydew is naturally sweet I didn't have to add more sugar than the recommended and I neither changed anything to this recipe.
2292	274	This is the best!!! Even my son who refuses “healthy food” could not get enough !!!!
2293	274	ok, gets very Watery..Not worth the effort of cutting everything up.
2294	274	Made for a book club meeting and most everyone asked for the recipe. Will make it again but with nicoise olives.
2295	274	This was amazing!
2296	274	This was delicious and refreshing.  I would not change a thing.  Don’t scrimp on the mint — use it!  This recipe is already a new summer favorite.
2297	274	Love this salad!!! All 5 of my children ask for it every week in the summer.  I marinate the onions in a little extra lime juice, but make everything else as written.
2298	274	This was great, it's my new favourite summer salad, wouldn't change a thing
2302	275	Wow! What a find! My family loved it! I increased everything by half to fit in a 9x13, and served it hot with ice cream. Definitely a do-over!
2303	275	Thank you! I was searching for a recipe to use an edible arrangement I was sent during the COVID outbreak. I wasn’t comfortable eating the fresh fruit without cooking it and this was perfect. I made mine using cantaloupe and grapes.
2304	275	Family loved taste like a peach cobbler. Didn't use cake mix. I had oatmeal bar cookie mix . Mix it according except for the jelly. Anyway divided the mixture in 1/2 placed in pie plate then cantaloupe mixture then rest of bar mix. Will make again since I still have cantaloupe but use less sugar it was a little to sweet which probably depends on the fruit
2305	275	A great way to use ripe cantaloupe. I made according to recipe but to the cake mix I added about a 1/4 cup sliced almond to add a little crunch. Doesn't taste like cantaloupe, more like peach crisp to me. My husband thinks it taste like apple pie. If I have a lot of cantaloupe again I would make this.
2306	275	I followed the recipe exactly but it wasn't golden brown at 45 minutes so I cooked it an hour. The butter wasn't enough to make a crust with the cake mix on top and it was both soggy and had pockets of cake mix in it (which is what I expected to happen, honestly, but I wanted to follow the recipe correctly.) I cut the cantaloupe pretty small and it still had way too much of that definitive cantaloupe flavor except for a few pieces which were pretty small. The texture of the cantaloupe was really off-putting in combination with the rest of it. Maybe cooking very small pieces of cantaloupe in the sugar and spice and butter mixture might make this better, as well as actually making some sort of dump cake or cobbler crust for it. As it stands, this recipe is definitely not something I would ever make again, it's going in the trash and I never waste food. Please don't let the positive reviews fool you; this was horrible.
2307	275	This was SO good!  And I don't even like cantaloupe!!! Just follow the directions and it tastes like a peach cobbler - I couldn't believe it! I had cantaloupe left over from a fruit basket and didn't want to toss it, so I took a chance.  I was really skeptical at first, hot cantaloupe??? Really? But when it came out of the oven, wow, it smells great.  Just add whipped cream!!!
2308	275	The reviews are correct...it's definitely hard to tell this was cantaloupe as there was no melon flavor...at all.  Good thing in my book.  Make sure you taste your melon and adjust your sugar amount...I did not add any extra sugar since my melon was naturally sweet and with the cake mix it was really still too sweet for my liking.  Everyone who tired this raved.  I won't use this recipe again but it has inspired me to create my own without using a box mix so I can control the sweetness.  Another suggestion, make sure your melted butter covers the entire cake mix top or you will have powdery spots.  Maybe use more than 1/2 cup melted butter or spread it out with a spatula after you drizzle it over the top
2309	275	This was good, but I did some altering after reading reviews: cut the sugar to 1/3 c. and the cake mix to 1/2 a box [used Jiffy yellow cake, 9 oz]. It was still VERY sweet. Also, I cut the topping butter to 1/4 c. I added 1 c. more melon, 1 more Tbs. of lemon, and 2 more Tbs. w.w. flour.  I'm glad I did, as there would have been very little runny fruit and mostly cake mix topping.
2310	276	I used 1 tsp of liquid peppermint instead. I kept it in the dehydrater for 20 hours.  Loved it.
2311	276	This was okay but it was a lot of work AND time and not one I'd make again. I know this is candy but it was far too sweet in my opinion. Plan on 30 minutes to soften the rinds and because they are so wet, it will take the full 8 hours to dehydrate.
2312	277	Easy and VERY tasty!  Will make again. :)  Since we used frozen watermelon, we did not add ice.
2313	277	I had 4 cups of watermelon so I used it all. It was a wonderful summer drink ,everyone loved them.
2314	277	I love this application for rich sweet summer watermelon.  The recipe calls for a little more sugar than we liked so we cut it back to about 1 T.  I didn't really understand the inclusion of vodka so I left it out and doubled the orange liqueur.  Sipping on these on the back deck while the grill is heating up may be the epitome of a summer evening.
2315	277	tired it but it just didn't taste right. Too much alcohol to watermelon.
2316	277	3.19.17  Had some watermelon to use up, so I mixed up my first watermelon margarita.  It was the perfect sidekick to a Sunday evening barbecue.
2317	278	I did not make any changes except to add some Rum. So delicious!
2318	278	I like it. Thank you for sharing
2319	278	Loved it...but I added tequila
2320	278	Kids loved it - perfect for a hot day
2321	278	This is so good as written. Made it once with lemon juice I had on hand and it was delicious! This is a must try!
2322	278	Delicious watermelon limeade drink. I did freeze some watermelon cubes in advance, instead of using ice. We have made it twice and my whole family really like it! Winner!!!!
2323	278	it does not tase like anything its better to just have the watermelon
2324	278	I don't have the words for it
2325	278	Great straight out of the blender or made into ice-cube-tray popsicles.
2326	279	Delicious! I used a super ripe cantaloupe, vanilla soy milk, poured over ice and yumm so tasty.
2327	279	This was really good-once I added a few changes! It needs more than just a little bit of sugar, so one or two extra tablespoons of honey or agave bring out the sweetness of the cantaloupe.
2328	279	Quick and tasty! No sugar needed, especially if you're using a very ripe cantaloupe. I used non-fat milk, but this would be good with almond, soy or cashew milk too. This recipe made 24oz of "juice". Yum!
2329	280	This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. We always called it pickled watermelon rind. Hindsight; I would have chopped the chunks smaller. I like to eat this on hot, buttered, breakfast biscuits or on hot, buttered, dinner rolls; with sliced pickled JALAPENOS!! The sweet and hot combination is the bomb diggity!! Very easy recipe. Just be prepared for the multiple days of prep!
2330	280	WOW! so seriously yummy and sweet! worth the many days of easy work! If you are diabetic, watch your numbers as there is ALOT of sweetness! only thing I would suggest is for suggestions on easy ways to remove the green from the rind. I used ground cinnamon and cloves instead of whole, mixing it into the end day syrup before pouring into sterilized jars. had some syrup leftover which went on French toast.. SWOON! now I can call out with "grandma" , "bring me some watermelon candy"!!
2331	280	Classic and simple.  Brings back nothing but good memories.
2431	293	super yummy. I changed out the cantaloupe and blue berries for canned mandarin Oranges and doubled the mint since I love mint .
3794	457	Fantastic cake! My daughter substituted olive oil for vegetable oil. Such a satisfing cake.
2332	280	This is almost identical to the recipe my grandmother gave to me about 60 yrs ago (which someone liberated from my kitchen). Thank you so very much for posting this. A nurse friend had never heard of watermelon pickles and when I told her I was going to make them, she asked her Japanese grandmother if she had ever heard of them. The response was very enthusiastic ... "I haven't tasted them in decades ... tell June if she will send me a pint, I'll give her a pint of berry jam." You have pleased more people than you know.
2333	280	Five stars just for putting this recipe up!  Thank you so much for doing so.  My great-grandfather would talk about having watermelon candy made of the rinds when he was growing up in Texas.  As a child, I always thought he was kidding me.  Turns out he wasn't!  I will definitly make this this summer and let ya'll know how it goes.  :)
2334	280	This is the best recipe grandma gave to us.
2335	281	I loved the recipe! It was simple and delicious and very easy to make. One thing I did differently with this was added a touch of honey and that put it over the top for me. Thank you so much for giving me a new summer favorite to share with my loved ones.
2336	281	No need for sugar! The fruit is sweet enough. It is awesome with watermelon, honeydew. Sometimes I will use coconut or almond milk instead of water for a creamier version.
2337	281	I cut the sugar in half and still thought it was too sweet. Also, I just don't think I like cantaloupe blended like that. I think it would be better mixed with some other kind of fruit or flavor in with it. Thanks anyway.
2338	281	I really liked this! It would make a great summertime party mocktail. I did sub out stevia for the sugar.
2339	281	Sweet and refreshing, perfect summer treat. I added a quarter teaspoon vanilla and 2 tsp sugar instead of 6. i would recommend keeping the between 2 and 4 tsps.
2340	281	Substituted sugar with Splenda. Cool and refreshing! Next time, adding mint and rum!
2341	281	Yummy!
2342	281	Delicious! I'm nearly 9 months pregnant and was craving something refreshing. This totally hit the spot!
2343	281	So good , very refreshing drink . Love it .
2344	282	I added a shot of tequila to each glass.
2345	283	This tastes great, the sugar isn't too much. It's a great ratio. I just put all the ingredients in a food processor until it was a paste-texture and then poured it all together and stirred it, don't have a full-size blender.Also made simple syrup with 1 of the cups of water and the cup of sugar, because I'm always worried about the texture of white sugar. 5/5 stars!
2346	283	It was pretty good I'm not a fan of watermelon. my girls liked it. instead of using a cup of sugar I did like some of the other people who comment and only used half a cup of sugar. I did add a lil more than 1/2 a cup of lemon juice and maybe next time I may add a little more strawberries
2347	283	Wow.. our household was out of lemon juice so we used lime! Best choice ever!! When the glass was empty I put some ice cubes into to kept it colder but delicious!! I’m gonna make this again!
2348	283	I made 2 batches of this in one night. Everyone loved it and it was gone so fast I made more. I used my vitamix and it was so easy. I even made popsicles with some of it and they were tasty too!
2349	283	This is a great, refreshing drink (and this can easily be used for adult drinks as well), but I didn’t use any sugar at all.  I did double up on the strawberries however (accidentally) and they were fresh picked from a local farm, so they’re probably sweeter than grocery store strawberries.  Even so, the fruit is sweet enough...no sugar needed!
2350	283	instead of  lemon, i used pineapple juice. i would definitely do this again!!!
2351	283	I would totally make it again and luckily i have to! I though it was a little to sweet but it was my watermelon.
2352	283	Really easy and delicious!!!!
2353	283	I am not sure where people went wrong! I loved this and so did my family. I made it after a day out at the pool and it was so refreshing. I had extra watermelons and so I thought I would try something slushy. Oh! I made this as directed then halved it and added about a cup of ice and blended it. Delicious! I will definitely make this again!
2354	284	The bread was delicious. Like others, I skipped the topping to avoid the calories. I also lightened it up a bit. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 and used splenda. Also cut the oil by almost half and used a bit more of the puree than what was called for. Came out great!
2355	284	Very good--just has a hint of cantaloupe after you eat a few bites, stronger the next day.  When you puree it, leave some shreds; don't liquify it. I didn't make the glaze-- it's a very sweet bread and doesn't need it.  I put about 3/4 c pecans in the bread. This is so great for tasteless cantaloupes! Love it!!
2356	284	I have 2 grown sons that live with me and together they can NOT even agree on what day it is. For the first time since they we children, they both came home from work raving about "the bread" in their lunch.
2357	284	I halved the recipe to make one loaf rather than two, and I used walnuts in place of pecans. I also used brown sugar throughout rather than white and it turned out well.
2358	284	I made this healthier. For sweeteners, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and  1/2 cup Splenda. I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and mixed in 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup pureed bananas. I added in 1 cup roasted pecans. I didn't make the topping in this recipe. Tasted great!
2359	284	I never would think to use cantaloupe to make a quick bread, but I'm so glad I found this recipe!  It is quite possibly my favorite now. I didn't make the glaze & I made mini loaves, so they could be frozen.  I don't think I would change anything in this recipe, except next time, I'm adding nuts to the batter. SO YUMMY! Had it for breakfast today, toasted with a bit of butter.
2360	284	I made the recipe exactly as written, though the praline topping was not appealing so I didn't  add it. It was okay but was more bland tasting than I had expected. I haven't given up on the idea but will likely make some changes the next time I make it. I will probably add nuts to the batter and adjust the sugar (reduce) and spices (change or increase).
2361	284	The bread turned out wonderful—the praline glaze not so much. The directions for the glaze need to state the power setting on microwave. I followed directions exactly and my glaze semi-solidified. I will just have to heat glaze for a shorter amount of time the next time I make it.
2362	284	I really liked this, but my husband loved it. I thought the praline glaze went very well with it (I was worried since another commenter said it did not). Probably won't make again because it really doesn't taste like cantaloupe and honestly it reminded me of banana bread -- so I would rather just make the banana bread :)
2363	285	I found it best to cut the watermelon into very small pieces and let them sit over a strainer for 10 minutes or so, helping to drain the juices, therefore no runny pie.
2364	285	Pie was light and tasty.  I substituted fat free whipped topping and used sugar free cherry jello because I couldn't fine watermelon.  The result was very tasty.  The water from the watermelon made the bottom of the graham cracker crust a little soft/soggy by days 2 and 3, but still very tasty.  I will make it again.
2365	285	This was a fantastic recipe idea and really easy to make if you take the short route of cool whip.  Changes I made were;
2366	285	Be sure to boil the 1/4 cup of water to dissolve the gelatin in or you have a slight grainy-ness to the finished pie.
2367	285	This easy to make recipe is surprisingly fresh and tasty.  I have had a lot of requests to make this, and to share the recipe.  This pie should be consumed within a day, but I've never had any issues.
2368	285	The worst pie ever made. Water liquefies the  whip cream and soggs the graham cracker crust.   Don't bother wasting your time making this.
2369	285	I couldn't even imagine this outside of the Deep South or Maybe Midwest, but I had to try it. Bumper NH melon crop... Used vanilla pudding mix instead of 'jello' (couldn't find watermelon flavor)-- which gave instruction for adding "berries" (basically drain fruit really well), and regular whipped cream. Refrigerated overnight. A little gooey but delicious.
2370	285	Absolutely Amazing!!! I make these all Summer long it's my favorite and everyone else's too.
2371	285	I make this pie every Summer & my Guests LOVE IT.. I even make it for ''Birthdays'' instead of Cake.  I cut the watermelon in pieces, then set them in a covered container for a while, then DRAIN the excess juice.. Then assembly only takes less than 10 min. then into the refrig..We can eat an entire dinner & still have room for this Light & Fluffy PIE!!
2372	286	This is really labor intensive but worth it. If your cantaloupe isn’t super ripe, you need to up the sugar. I didn’t use the butter extract but added a splash of vanilla because that’s what I had. It doesn’t taste anything like cantaloupe - which I love - but it is delicious!
2373	286	Fantastic recipe, this was the first time I've made merengue and this recipe worked very well. I didn't brown mine as much as the picture shows, I like it whiter and the next time I will double the merengue recipe to mound it up even more.
2374	286	I didn't make the meringue, we had meringue nests left over from another dessert so we used those instead and as such I can't comment on the meringue part of this recipe.
2375	286	Well I tried. Got it nice and thick and surprisingly creamy, but when I tasted it, I couldn't make myself pour it into the pie shells.  It just tasted wrong.  Maybe cinnamon and cloves would have saved it.
2376	286	The pie works okay, I just really didn't like it.  I don't think cantaloupe lends itself well to this use.  The pie will get eaten, but I won't make it again.
2377	286	Very good.  I would do as another user suggested and use as ripe a cantaloupe as possible.  I made some alterations in order to make it slightly healthier.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and used Splenda in the filling (not the meringue) to cut down the sugar.  I used just slightly over 1/4 cup of Splenda and it was fine.  In addition, I used vanilla instead of butter flavoring and that worked well.  Last, I used a graham cracker crust.
2378	286	My Mother in Law was making this 50+ years ago without the pie crust. She couldn't remember the recipe so I found it here. This is the most Awesome Pie Ever. I do leave out the butter extract, but only because I didn't have any. And I don't use a pie crust. This is as close to hers as I have found. Be sure to use a great tasting Ripe cantaloupe. Just Awesome!!!
2379	286	My husband just had some dental work done so I just made the filling.  This is a really great pudding!!  I didn't have butter extract so I used vanilla instead.  It turned out fantastic.  This would be a great way to get young children who think they don't like cantaloupe to try it.  I think it would change their mind.
2380	286	This recipe was great, I didn't tell my husband what kind of pie it was and had him guess, he thought it was banana! I added a couple dashes of ground cloves and a dash of ground nutmeg, and followed the suggestion to use cornstarch to thicken the filling-(Dissolve the cornstarch in small amount of water then add to filling while on stove)My cantaloupe was very ripe(had dents on the skin) so I suggest you use a little less sugar if your's is also and less sugar on the merengue as well. Let the filling thicken on stove considerably before you place in the baked pie crust. After the pie cooled I refridgerated it then served it chilled.
2381	287	My son made it. It came out really good. It was easy to make and was gone the next day. Will make it again. Didn't use all the ingredients.
2382	287	i just used ranch dressing,,very lightly...so good
2383	287	Love this on a hot summer day.  I did change the dressing though. I used blood orange olive oil with blackberry balsamic vinegar.
2384	287	I did not care for this
2385	287	The sweet of the watermelon and tart from the lime were perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day.
2386	287	Excellent. Love it! I've used different infused oils instead of walnut. My favorite is blood orange.
2387	287	Different yet healthy and every satisifying
2388	287	A simple, flavorful and refreshing salad perfect for the warmer summer months. *Update* I used Tajin in place of the paprika and this recipe is even better.
2389	288	I have been inundated with cantaloupe from the garden and my husband suggested we make a chilled cantaloupe soup. I found this recipe and gave a go! It was a little bland, so the next time I made it, I doubled the cinnamon and gave it a shake of ginger and 2 tbs of honey. It was much better!
2390	288	Nothing special about this soup. I looked for reviews on it so that I could spice it up with something, but there were no reviews. I’ll say this, though. It was easy to make!
2391	288	This recipe was really bland. I added honey which helped, but it still needs "kick." Don't know if I'll make it again.
2392	288	I made this for good friends, who loved it. So simple. I held back a bit on the orange juice since I didn't know how many cups of cantaloupe were expected, and it was great at 1 1/2 cups of oj. I added a bit of salt.
2393	288	I used a ninja...maybe I didn't 'process' it enough, but it was still somewhat a little chunky.  any suggestions?  other than that, I love it.  tastes great and definately really easy to make.
2394	288	excellent. very refereshing, easy to make , and super healthy!
2395	288	I really wanted to like this, but the consistency was strange... kind of like a thin slushy, and the flavor reminded me of an orange julius drink.  It just didn't seem like a soup at all.
2432	293	It’s good but don’t make it too far ahead. I made it 48 hours in advance and the fruit didn’t hold up as well as I’d hoped in the dressing. Still very tasty though.
2396	288	Yum! My cantaloupe wasn’t very sweet so I added a bit of mango and a little bit of swerve sweetener. As a light summer snack, appetizer or dessert it’s perfect as is! For a meal, I mixed in some unflavored protein powder and topped with some unsweetened coconut flakes to boost the nutrition. Looking forward to using this recipe quite a bit this summer!
2397	288	Welp, this sounded good and I followed the directions, but it did not taste good. Out of a family of five, I was the only one who dared to eat some. Everyone else took a taste and refused to eat more. The rest if getting poured down the drain.
2398	289	Good. Brought it to a party. It was a hit. Good way to use fresh mint. I used fewer onions.
2399	289	Delicious. Go easy on the oil and vinegar.
2400	289	I made this salad to take to a friend's party.  I added some kale to add more color, and  it was fairly tasty.  I would suggest making sure the watermelon is cold and firm- it gets watery after awhile.  You cannot make it beforehand too early!
2401	289	LOVED THIS! I used red onion. This was light, refreshing and delicious...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
2402	290	So far so yummy
2403	290	I've been making this for years, I can't count how many times . . . every summer get-together or office food day, this is my go-to contribution.  It always gets raves and is now constantly requested. My son's brother-in-law who owns 2 restaurants and is rather pretentious about everyone's dishes even asked for the recipe!  (I thought about refusing as he doesn't share any of his secrets . . . ha!) I cut the watermelon into very small cubes, maybe 1/4", and drain it well.  I usually hollow out the watermelon to serve the salsa in.  The lime tortilla chips are a must complimenting the sweet and heat with nice tang.  Thank you for this recipe that has made me a rock star!
2404	290	Always requested and always a hit!
2405	290	Our whole group loved this! Fire and Ice is the perfect name and it is indeed a lovely combination of sweet, cool and hot. We served with chips and then later with pulled pork. I found that letting the chopped watermelon sit in a colander for a while helped keep the salsa from getting too watery. Otherwise we made no changes. Looking forward to trying this on grilled fish too!
2406	290	I didn't believe this at first, but it actually is good! At first, it is a burst of cold sweetness and the tang of salt, followed by a slow burn. It is a very interesting mix of flavors and different timings. No wonder this is so popular!
2407	290	Absolutely FABU! Thank you so much for the recipe. Thank you reviewers for all your additional tips and tricks, I always read everything before prep. My only tweak was using fresh garlic vs. garlic salt, because we love garlic, Maldon salt and lime zest in addition with juice. Huge, HUGE HIT for family visit. I am already making a second batch for the next gathering the very next week. We also used garlic/chili tortilla chips as well as lime tortilla chips both awesome. Enjoy. Cheers.
2408	290	I didn't use the bell pepper but the guests loved this. I didn't try it because I can't eat raw onions and I don't like cilantro. But it was a hit.
2409	290	Very good especially with the lime flavored Doritos. Everyone that tasted it has asked for the recipe!
2410	290	I have made it twice. It is very easy and very good!
2411	291	great
2412	291	I'm not a fan of drink water of any kind, but this taste like what would call adult Kool-aid. So very good. And by calling it adult Kool-aid my nephew assumed it had alcohol. Which meant more for me.LOL
2413	291	My first time making this and it tasted real good. Next will try with soda water and lemon juice.
2414	291	I made this as Chef John's recipe noted, except I used Splenda instead of sugar to make the simple syrup thus making it nearly sugar-free (Just the bit of natural sugar occurring in the watermelon). This was a truly refreshing drink, perfect for a hot summer day.
2415	291	Delicious!! An even better serving option is to freeze some of the Aqua Fresca into ice cubes. It's a great presentation, and the Aqua Fresca doesn't dilute as the cubes melt!
2416	291	Amazing!  So refreshing!  Thanks Chef John.  I also made the watermelon pizza and it was the highlight of the meal.  Right now I have lemon peels resting with the sugar for the State Fair Lemonade.  I can’t wait to try that tomorrow.  Chad John, if you ever come to the East coast I want to take you and Michelle out to dinner!
2417	291	Made as written.  Delicious!  Summertime in a glass.
2418	291	Made as written (except sub xylitol for sugar), delicious.
2419	291	I am making it again today because I loved it.  So refreshing & a great way to use up a whole watermelon before it gets mushy.
2420	292	This dish is DELICIOUS. I make it every summer with CSA melons. It's great with cantaloupe, musk melon or honeydew!
2421	292	One of my favorite! I made it several times this year, going to make it now! I serve it with a couple less that a teaspoon of honey and cucumber  slices on top.
2422	292	Fantastic recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out to be a huge hit with my guests! Very flavorful and light. Will definitely make this again.
2423	292	This was fantastic! Easy to make, and the flavors blended together nicely.
2424	292	Made as directed. Was delicious! Didn't think I would like the onion and garlic in it but it gave it a good flavor.
2425	292	Very good.  I substituted cider vinegar for balsamic and red pepper for black.  I think the heat of the red pepper pairs better with the sweetness of the melon.   I also added pistachio nuts and a dollop of Greek yogurt.
2426	292	This was summer yumminess in a bowl. I used my seedy, strange-looking cucumbers from the garden, extra garlic, and 1/8 cup white wine vinegar. I can’t wait to make a batch with cilantro, one with mint, and one with basil to compare.
2427	292	I’ve made this more times than I can count in the past few weeks. So easy and so, so good! I’ve subbed grapes and nectarines for the honey dew on occasion with good results. I use the juice of one lime then add the white balsamic to make a 1/4 cup combined. And instead of the jalapeño I do 1 TB of mild green salsa because I don’t like things too spicy. I also add about a cup of water otherwise mine ends up too thick. I’ve added a handful of spinach too, which gives it nice color but does not change the flavor. And it makes 4-5 servings for me.
2428	292	I made this to use up some cucumber from my garden.  It was okay.  I wouldn't buy another honeydew melon to make this soup, but if I were at a friend's house and they served it, I'd eat it.
2429	293	increased the sugar, removed the mint leaves!! So good
2430	293	I have made this often and it's always a huge hit - however I always substitute the mint out and use fresh basil and when possible the basil I grow.  Either way the Basil is yummy.  I never made it with mint.
2433	293	I needed to make this a day ahead, so I mixed the fruit ahead of time, covering and refrigerating overnight. I added raspberries and mango for their taste and bright color. Then, I muddled the mint and sugar and added the lime juice and refrigerated that overnight also (separately from the fruit.) I poured the mint/sugar/lime juice mixture over the fruit mix the next morning, pressing the mint leaves into the strainer to get out all the juice. (Then I threw out the mint leaves.) I refrigerated a few hours, stirring once, until lunch.I brought it to room temperature before serving (about 30 minutes), stirring once before serving. It was very good, pretty and with a hint of mint, and my guests loved it. That said, I think it would be best made and served in the same day. It looked and tasted good - and it would have looked and tasted spectacular if a few hours fresher. Use all the mint leaves you can - I used one whole package from the herb section in the grocery store. Next time, I will use more mint leaves and more lime juice, as well as the additional one tsp sugar recommended by others. This is a recipe I will perfect over time - and it will be worth it!
2434	293	loved this and so did everyone else.
2435	293	I used just a drop of mint extract instead of the sprigs but it was too faint to really taste at all. But it was good, everyone liked it a lot.
2436	293	Initially made it as a cool and refreshing snack after early morning hiking. Wife and I both love it, shared with some friends, NOW I get requests !! Beat out my homemade Raspberry Cobbler in number of requests !!! NEVER would have thought it.
2437	293	increased the sugar, removed the mint leaves!! So good
2438	294	I used 3 cups of watermelon about 3 tablespoons of sugar a cup of ice and cup of water. Perfect!
2439	294	I don't think that's good.
2440	294	Although I like watermelon, I did not enjoy this drink. Initial taste was not flavorful enough until I doubled the watermelon. With that, and the sweetener, it's kind of okay now. Sorry; it just doesn't work well with my taste buds.
2441	294	Family loved it!! I doubled the recipe and added some ice... Yummy!!
2442	294	Family loved it!! I doubled the recipe and added some ice... Yummy!!
2443	294	Delicious! But only serves two people, not four
2444	294	As the recipe submitter suggested, I used crushed ice instead of the water because I wanted a slushy drink. Just a suggestion, you may need to adjust the sugar depending on how sweet your watermelon is. Mine wasn't very sweet, so making this drink out of it was a perfect way to use it.
2445	294	Just a note: it should actually serve 2 people even though it says 4, but other than that, liked it!
2446	294	Just a note: it should actually serve 2 people even though it says 4, but other than that, liked it!
2447	295	As written, the amounts are WAY off.  According to the recipe, this one single drink has 2 tablespoons (1 ounce) of gin to 16 ounces of tonic water. This would be so watered down that it's barely alcoholic. I highly suggest you make it using standard drink proportions - 1.5oz of gin to 3oz of tonic water...or 2oz gin to 4oz tonic.  I liked the fresh flavor from the watermelon, but it was very subtle. Next time I'll muddle some watermelon in a shaker with the gin, add ice, then strain it into a glass with more watermelon cubes. I'll be making this again as a regular summer drink.
2448	296	very good and easy to make,i left a little bit of the melon in there
2449	296	Very Good!  I muddled some mint leaves in with the watermelon for an added flavor dimension.  It was fresh and tasty!
2450	296	This is a good simple recipe. I was in the supermarket today and they had Tropicana Watermelon juice on sale so I used that with a home made simple syrup (to taste). That addition would make it 5 stars.
2451	296	We thought the vodka overpowered the watermelon so you really couldn’t taste it.   Maybe if the watermelon had been sweeter, it would have been better.
2452	296	What's not to love about this?  My watermelon isn't very sweet, so it really needs just a touch of sugar.  This is a nice summer drink.  Thanks, Genevieve!
2453	297	Love this drink. My new shot.
2454	297	Subbed in simple syrup for the sugar to deal with the dilution problem with the sugar turned out really good
2455	297	my tree was loaded with lemons..so i made lemon drop shots...yes the sugar fell to bottom but i made more and didn't have to add more sugar..win...win...
2456	297	I used dextrose (corn sugar) added directly to my fresh squeezed meyer lemon juice.  It's like powder sugar and dissolves quickly.  I also substituted erythritol for the sugar to dip my meyer lemon slices into.  Great shots!!
2457	297	We liked it but I don't know if it was worth squeezing the lemons for this. I may make them again using simple syrup not sugar. The sugar sinks and sits at the bottom of the glass.
2458	297	Used simple syrup instead of sugar but definitely great!
2459	297	Not bad. It's not worth juicing the lemons for though. And the sugar goes right to the bottom of the shot glass. Next time, use lemon juice and I'll warm it and melt the sugar in the juice first. I only made 2 shots.
2460	297	My favorite shot. My best friend and I used to do these all the time when we were younger. Now it will be my memorial shot for her
2461	297	Love, love, love
2462	298	Amazing! I wanted a fruit salad without it tasting like a dessert.  This is PERFECT! Thank you for sharing!
2463	298	Liked this fruit salad very much. The sauce blended all the fruit nicely yet you still tasted each fruit. I started layering the fruits but when I added the sauce I mixed it all up. Not sure why you need to wait 2-3 hours before serving. The bananas did get a little mushy after a couple hours out on the counter. Still had great flavor. The sauce never did thicken though I cooked it for 10+ minutes, but still tasted good.  I liked the way all the fruits tasted like they belonged.
2464	298	We prepared this fruit salad for a small party that we held this week. It was a huge hit and better than even we thought that it would be. Definitely worth the 5*.I tried to stick very much to the recipe for this time, with the only exception being that I added 5 kiwi fruits since that was what the container I purchased held and I didn't want to waste the other 2. I actually thought that the 5 fruits was a perfect quantity and, after looking at it, that 3 might be a little light, to be honest.I wouldn't change a thing, to be honest, and plan on making this again when future activities call for it. The only negative was that the blueberries that I purchased were a little more sour than I would have liked but that is no fault of the salad. Overall, two thumbs up from ourselves and everyone that we served it to.
2465	298	It was great. I may change it up next time but for now, perfect.
2466	298	My family loved it. Didn’t change a thing.
2467	298	Excellent. Dressing was very good.
2468	298	I did not make any changes. Made it exactly as the recipe called for. It was easy to make and everyone loved the taste. I will make it again
2469	298	I love this recipe! The sauce is amazing. I have been making it for the 4th of July and it has become a repeat request dish for me to bring! Thank you!!
2470	298	Fabulous salad. Good for you too
2471	299	Took way longer than 6 minutes but it worked:)
2472	299	5 STAR for Taste and Ease!  Bookmark this one!!!!I used 5 yolks instead if 3 whole eggs ---to avoid cooked egg whites, or just make sure you beat the eggs really well before adding.
2473	299	I made it using limes rather than lemons; it took 5 limes to make 3/4cup of juice.Worth noting that, if you use a non-metallic double boiler, it does taste better and end up smoother (as it will heat more evenly and gradually) but it takes longer to properly thicken and doesn't bubble, so you need to judge when it is thick enough.  You'll not get scrambled eggs this way either.I used the cream-sugar-and-butter-first method given by Anonymous this time and it worked nicely.Don't forget to sterilise the jam jars and lids first using boiling water if you intend to keep the curd for longer.  Fill them almost to the top and screw the lids on before they cool for optimum keeping.These quantities are just right for filling two 320g jam jars.
2474	299	Such a SIMPLE recipe! I've been making this for years...my "go-to" recipe. I doubled it this time, producing four half-pint jars. I've used it as a filling for a Blueberry Lemon Tea Bread, as a top layer for cheesecake, in Lemon Bars, but I like it most on hot buttered homemade artisan toast. PERFECT recipe, thanks!
2475	299	So good
2476	299	Just made it to use as a topping on a lemon ricotta cheesecake I made yesterday. I think the recipe is delicious and perfect as written, other than the fact that it took  about 12 minutes to thicken. I cooked it on an electric stove top with the heat  set between three and four
2477	299	simple recipe but mine just would not thicken 'til AFTER it was removed from heat. then i could have picked it up in one piece.   i was waiting til it stuck to a spoon which it never did.  i believe it would have been fine had i not cooked it as long as i did.  i will try this again and won't be worried about it thickening
2478	299	I loved this recipe.  Due to the egg crisis, I had left over egg yolks from making macarons and wanted to use them wisely.  I read the reviews and used a whisk frother to blend the yolks, sugar and juice.  Then I threw in the butter.  Melted over medium heat and whisked the whole time.  Very easy and tasted perfect.  I didn't have to strain it because I didn't add the zest, the amount of tartness was perfect without it.
2479	299	Perfect to have on hand and so quick
2480	300	No changes at all.  The drink is sooo refreshing.  Stick to the recipe.
2481	300	Excellent cocktail! but don't be like me and only read the first step! I put the soda in the shaker and made a drunk mess lol!
2482	300	Delicious!
2483	300	Perfection.  Will add to the regular rotation.
2484	300	First I ever made, and they came out great!
2485	300	I prefer vodka and it was delicious! Thanks.
2486	300	Love TCs - hit the spot too darned often. Don't care. Add fresh OJ and keep the Angostura. Use a straw.
2487	300	Excellent recipe.
2488	300	I've tried several versions of TC on here, but like this mix of gin, sweet and sour the best!
2489	301	I've made this twice.  Both times were great successes.  Very easy.  A little corn in the sauce if you like it thicker. Bon Appetit!
2490	301	I made this for my husband and I on Christmas Day. I substituted lime for the lemon and I put 1 tsp ground rosemary in the cavity instead of sprigs. I used white cooking wine as well. Delicious with baby red potatoes. We loved it. My new favorite recipe.
2491	301	I had to add seasoning because the dish was a little bland. Other than that it was good. It was moist and nicely done.
2492	301	I made this for Christmas dinner for my husband and I. It was amazing. I did substitute a 1/4 of a lime instead of a lemon in each cavity. I made two. Instead of rosemary sprigs I added 1 tsp of crushed rosemary in each cavity.Delicious tender and juicy
2493	301	Excellent!!! Prepared from the recipe with minor exceptions: I used White Cooking Wine and homemade vegetable broth (lower sodium.
2494	301	I mostly followed the directions. At the oven temp. drop and basting stage, I removed the lemons and squeezed them out on top of the hens, and put slices of apples in the cavities for the second half of cooking. Great recipe, I’ll be using this for future poultry cooking reference for sure!
2495	301	This was a pre-Thanksgiving entree. 4 hens, 6 mouths and the platter was empty in 30 minutes!The garlic from the roasting was mashed to give a very earthy taste and aroma to the gravy!
2496	301	Prepared just as recipe suggested with the exception of putting pat of butter under skin and added Kinders wood fire smoked garlic spice with the salt and pepper. I fixed 2 in my cast iron skillet. Next time will add mushrooms to the sauce at the end. Best recipe I’ve tried in years!
2497	301	We've enjoyed this for years.  A traditional Christmas Eve dinner at our house.  Lots of Rosemary growing here so put sprig in cavity and lemon wedge.  (thought I made this up, LOL).  Everything the same except for no wine and used pan juices to make gravy for mashed potatoes.  Also I get the smaller game hens and do not cut in half.Much more fun when everyone gets their own chick... Very delicious dinner, easy and very festive!
2498	302	My friends and I love garlic so I always add extra garlic.
2499	302	Easy..delicious
2500	302	Simple and straightforward, best way to eat scallops!!! One small suggestion if you want to wow guests, add some prosciutto when cooking. Cut it up first. add last minute.
2501	302	Wonderful recipe' and so easy to cook !  I would love to serve this with Roseto or rice  ! and some fresh Asparagus !
2502	302	love it the scallops was cook just right  thanks.
2503	302	Easy to prepare and absolutely delicious !
2504	302	What's not to like? Scallops? Butter? Garlic? It was very tasty and I'd make it again, but next time I would use a little less butter than I did. I was using only 12 oz of scallops and I think I still used a little too much butter even though I thought I used less than half the recipe said.
2505	302	So good added parmesan so good easy and wonderful recipe. And scallops were on sale this week perfect timing.
2506	302	Simple, delicious and elegant in presentation
2507	303	This is my go-to base recipe. I prefer less lemon, more oregano and I add .5 tbsp of paprika and a few minced cloves of garlic.
2508	303	I loved them but I boiled them in chicken broth first for 15 min
2509	303	These are incredible! I didn't change any ingredients, but I mixed the broth, oil and all spices together right in the casserole dish I mixed everything in (as opposed to first coating the potatoes and pouring the broth mixture on top afterward). I mixed it all again halfway through the hour of cooking.They were perfection!
2510	303	Is the chicken broth supposed to evaporate?  I baked longer than the allotted time and still had a LOT of liquid.  Taste was good, but no browning.
2511	303	This is one of my favourite potato recipes of all-time. I usually do not post recipe reviews but, after making this over 50 times, I thought it deserves a another review.My personal tips:I always keep a bit of reserved broth/juice in case it needs anything at the end.After an hour, I take the potatoes out, stir them around, and put them back in on broil or very high oven heat until they lightly crisp on top.So good!
2512	303	Made as is. Turned out very soupy, lemon was overpowering (mouth puckering), not enough spices, and need an extra half hour to fully cook. Do not recommend.
2513	303	Very good. You can simplify this by putting all the ingredients, besides the potatoes, in the pot/vessel with the broth. It all gets mixed up anyway. If I have sumac on hand I add some for extra citrus taste. You can double/triple the oregano.
2514	303	This recipe is wonderful. The only thing I do differently is use a 5 pound bag of Yukon Gold, one onion cut  in 8 quarters , 6 cloves of minced garlic , and toss it all with the spices and oil and potatoes. I add 5 pads of salted butter on  top and bake on 400  for 40 minutes . I then open and toss. I cook another 40 minutes .After it's baked I add the juice of 3 lemons and fresh parsley. Also add 1/2 Teaspoon more of each spice listen . Serve with Tzatziki!
2515	303	Amazing!  I only add an extra squeeze of lemon (I like lemon).This recipe is perfection.  They are the same even when reheated.  And the "juice" that remains when the potatoes are done is just delicious to spoon a bit over the rest of the meal.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.
2516	304	So good I used 3/4 cup sugar 6 cups water 1.2 cups line juice and it was so good and tart I think it is better with lime juice
2517	304	SOO good only takes me about 4 or 5 minutes to make and instead of squeezing the lemons used a store book squeezed lemons.
2518	304	This recipe makes lemonade that is way too sweet. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it's now delicious. I went with the recommended lemon juice amount of 1 cup but I think next time I'll add a little more for more oomph.
2519	304	so good
2520	304	This is the 2nd time making this recipe...and made a double batch haha Glad we did, as we went through half of the first pitcher while making the second to take on a little family picnic! I own a bakery/meals to go kitchen and plan on using this in my business to offer customers! I use 5-6 lemons, whatever I have and it still turns out great. Thanks for a fun easy recipe that even my kids can enjoy helping make!
2521	304	Very good.  Thanks for sharing.
2522	304	Just a little on the sweet side, but overall very good and quite easy to make!
2523	304	Very good
2524	304	I only had 5 lemons so I  added 4 cups H2O & 3/4 cup sugar and it turned out excellent. Couldn’t be more satisfied with the taste.
2525	305	These were a big hit at our house!  Thanks for posting.
2526	305	1 tablespoon of lemon pepper seasoning was too much.  The next time I make them I’m using 1 teaspoon of lemon pepper seasoning.  They were delicious though!
2527	305	Easy, fast, and delicious!  After reading reviews, was concerned about the result being salty, but it was just right.  I did add a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice!  Perfect!
2528	305	My husband loved every last one of these wings.  It was so easy to make and we just added a side salad and made ranch dressing/dip for both.  They were very delicious.
2529	305	They loved it, best recipe l tried
2530	305	My family loved it! Especially the kids.
2531	305	I agree to use 1 part lemon pepper to 2 part olive oil!! IT WAS EXTREMELY SALTY!
2532	305	An easy and tasty recipe that I plan to make again but with some tweaks for our family. It was too salty for us so I plan to cut the lemon pepper down to 2 teaspoons per 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  Thanks for sharing!
2533	305	I had 2 packs of wings so I had to triple this recipe..i used Walmart’s brand lemon and pepper seasoning and evoo. The perfect ratio for me was 2 parts evoo to 1 part lemon pepper. I fried my wings for 12 minutes since we like ours extra crispy.. another rule of thumb is to make sure the chicken’s dry before frying. (i laid mine out on paper towels beforhand) These turned out delicious!
2534	306	I prefer to keep the chicken crispy by not finishing the chicken covered with broth.  I rest the chicken while finishing the sauce and pouring it over the chicken breasts after they are on the plates.
2535	306	Amazing. I did add extra wine, and minced garlic. Dipped in egg, flour, egg than flour again, put in frig for 5 - 10 mins, then put in hot pan. Coating stated on, my son asked “which restaurant I ordered it from”
2536	306	Easy to make and tasty
2537	306	I thought it was a nice light meal I made it with skinless boneless thighs instead of breast.I only made one thigh not all it required but just as good
2538	306	Very good recipe
2539	306	Loved it!  Served it w fettucine noodles and broccoli, Poured small amount of the sauce over the noodles.
2540	306	loved it and so did my family
2541	306	one of our favorites
2542	306	mediocre recipe...kinda bland (needs more lemon, garlic & some wine), measurements are off (wasn't enuf egg to cover chicken) & the resulting sauce had the thickness of water.
2543	307	Very tasty but came out thick so I added a tablespoon of milk, yellow food coloring and the juice of a whole lemon. It made enough to frost 24 cup cakes This will be my new go to lemon frosting.
2544	307	It was delicious. We added 3 lemons and 1 TBSP of milk.
2545	307	I added 4 ounces of cream cheese, it was very good without but I was looking for a heavier consistency.  It is definitely a keeper. A*****
2546	307	I needed to add more lemon juice so it wasn't so stiff. It was hard to spread. It was really good  I will be adding even more next time so it spreads easier and is maybe a bit less sweet and hopefully adds more lemon flavour.
2547	307	This was totally delicious and it made the perfect amount to frost a two layer cake.  The only change I made was to add a couple teaspoons of lemon zest and a few drops of yellow food coloring.  Yum!
2548	307	Sooooo good!!! I used a whole lemon juiced in it and added a table spoon of milk to make it thinner. I was also able to divide into 3 portions because it's so sweet. I put straw holes in the cake and poured the coat the cake.
2549	307	So good!! I used a entire lemon, zested it the pealed it and puréed the whole thing until no pulp! Put the zest on top!
2550	307	A very simple and delicious recipe for an amazing lemon icing for my vanilla cake. Thank you for adding this recipe.
2551	307	I love it
2552	308	No more store bought artificial salad dressing. Good for life on this one.
2553	308	The vinaigrette came out pretty good.  I added a little extra lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper to the recipe though.  I felt it just needed slightly more seasoning.  I also was forced to use a strange Dijon from Trader Joe's that was very grainy like an unfiltered mustard or something.  It came out pretty good, but I think it would be better with a normal Dijon.  I'm also wondering why the recipe doesn't call for "WHITE Wine Vinegar" vs. "RED Wine Vinegar", seems kinda weird, but again it was pretty good.  I think I will try WHITE wine vinegar next time instead though.
2554	308	Simple and delicious.  I use a small clove of garlic so as not to be too strong.
2555	308	We liked it. Left out the oregano because I forgot it even though I have a potful of it outside. I added a bit more lemon juice & some Stevia because I wanted some sweetness to offset the acidic vinegar & lemon juice.
2556	308	calls for too much vinegar
2557	308	they loved it
2558	308	This is now my go-to salad dressing.
2559	308	Turned out great!   Used it on my couscous salad.
2560	308	Very tart, it burned my throat a bit. The mustard was quite overpowering. I do think, as written, it would be a good marinade for chicken.
2561	309	I’ve been making frog eyed salad for a long time now, I agree w above user it’s fun to see all the different renditions. Reading this, I am blown away how one can use an entire 16oz of acini de pepe 40oz of cannned pineapple, 33 oz of mandarin oranges, all the other ingredients & serve 10!? I had to take out one heaping cup of noodles & it was still over powering on the noodles. I also add strawberry, fresh pineapple, maraschino, cherries, & I only ever use the white marshmallows because I want the fruit & noodles to be the star of the show. Came here for measurement recommendations- regretted it lol. Well now I have some in the freezer hoping to thaw out for next time.
2562	309	I could eat this every day!
2563	309	I've made this several times. I made as directed and also used vanilla pudding in place of the other ingredients. Both ways are good. Just for fun I add some halved grapes making it look a little more like " frog eyes.
2564	309	I've always loved frog eye salad. It makes a lot and is  real crowd pleaser. I refrigerate the fruit ahead of time, make the pasta and custard and refrigerate together over night. Then I combine with the fruit and marshmallows (colored ones are fun), and I also add green grapes!
2565	309	Family favorite.  I used less sugar, only pineapple chunks or tidbits, fruit cocktail, and tropical fruit.  I change it up every time.
2566	309	I used strawberrys
2567	309	Love this recipe.  Seemed like an ordeal when I first read the recipe, but it is really not bad!  You can even cook the pasta ahead and rinse it very well with cold water and store in frig, then loosen it up with a fork so it is not clumped and make the lemon sauce when you are ready!  Be sure to add the marshmallows last minute and it keeps a few days in the frig!
2568	309	I made it exactly as the recipe is written, and it seems too heavy on the pasta, acini de pepe. I doubled the amount of Cool Whip and added more marshmallows. This was a little closer to the frog eye salad I remember from years ago. If I made it again, I would cut the pasta almost in half.
2569	309	I make this salad for holidays and it is enjoyed by my family.  I leave out the marshmallows and sprinkle the coconut on top of individual servings to accommodate personal tastes.
2570	310	Quick, easy and tender
2571	310	I will always cook lobster tails in an air fryer !! It turned out perfect!!!
2572	310	This was WOW! Amazing! Basically made the butter mixture, swabbed the lobster with it, cooked for 2 min and re-applied - only to cook in the air fryer for another 5 min. This was PERFECT! Wow good! I agree - this might be the only way I make lobster moving forward. Thank you Allrecipes Team for a “holy $&&7!” Good recipe!
2573	310	Cooked just under 7 minutes but should have checked at 5 minutes because they were overcooked.  Dish was tasty, however.
2574	310	Turned out good
2575	310	I've made this several times. Oddly the recipe photo doesn't match the described process. The photo isn't showing the tails to be "butterflied", just split.For my experience butterflying the tails makes it a challenge to get the meat to leave the bottom shell.My suggestion is to split the hard upper shell then pull the meat out, close the shells and let the meat rest on top of the hard top shells.Follow the recipe from there, it's tasty and easier to eat.
2576	310	DELISH..
2577	310	I made two 4 oz. Lobster tails for 6 minutes, with lemon & butter slathered on. Perfect!
2578	310	I loved this, next time for 2 4 os. Lobster tails cutting the time to 2 minutes per side, check and maybe 1 additional minute.  So delicious easier than making in my cast iron frying pan, and no mess.
2579	311	I used two salmon fillets. I took them out the fridge for about ten minutes before I put them in the oven. I drizzled some olive oil on one side and rubbed both filets together. I took  salt, pepper, paprika, no lemon and about a tablespoon of butter. I don't have a micro so didn't melt just whipped the seasonings into the butter and laid it in the top. Topped with parsley. I put a timer on 15 and ended up cooking em to about 22 mins when the white started reaching the top and the juices could be seen flowing a bit. Let it sit for a couple mins and enjoyed with honey mustard
2580	311	I didn't measure out anything since it was 2 pounds, but I used italian seasonings instead of paprika and it came out as a really delicious meal paired with haluski
2581	311	Easy as can be Most think fish is hard but don't over think it. Changing the recipe each time makes it fun and a surprise to the taste buds .
2582	311	it was so good
2583	311	Delicious!!! I made it with frozen flounder filets and concentrated lemon juice. It was perfectly done. I had to watch the time because the filets were thin. It took about 12 minutes. I will use this recipe again!!
2584	311	Pretty decent, but way too buttery. I'd cut down on the butter and maybe add some breadcrumbs as suggested by Melissa.
2585	311	Delicious!  Used fresh Spanish Mackerel we caught while deep sea fishing in South Carolina.  Followed recipe as written, turned out excellent!!
2586	311	Loved this simple recipe. I used Zatarain's Blackened Seasoning and it came out delicious.
2587	311	This is a fantastic recipe! I made it as the recipe states. But I added fresh chopped parsley and dill, because I had them on hand. I will definitely make this again!
2588	312	This is so good! We used lemon balm from our garden and it was wonderful.
2589	312	With all the marinade ingredients, I expected the flavor to hit like fireworks, but alas, the flavor was mediocre.  Everyone at our table was adding Ranch dressing, Asian chili sauce, or Dijon mustard after taking some bites.  I cooked the thighs on a grill pan on the stovetop instead of the grill and I suppose the grill would have added a better general flavor, but wouldn't have made it taste more lemony.  It made a gorgeous presentation on the platter with diagonally-cut green onion tops, but let us down after that.
2590	312	My picky kids ate this like candy.  It was delicious and very simple to make.  I did not have the fish sauce so I subbed a little bit of sesame oil.
2591	312	good but next time I do it I would be more bold with the ingredients maybe even double or triple what's recommended... the flavour was there but just not robust enough for my liking. but a great way to ease into this dish for sure.
2592	312	I REALLY don't get the whole "Vietnamese" flavor. It was just OK. I'll try it again, but add additional Lemon grass, FISH Sauce & maybe more Soy Sauce. It's just missing something. Even my SO remarked "Vietnamese? Really?"   It was easy to put together though.
2593	312	This is regular dish in my home. I do prefer it grilled rather than on the stove because the flavors come out more.
2594	312	I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews. BLAND, everything is very subtle. Expecting a stronger lemongrass flavor!!
2595	312	OMG delicious!! If you don’t count marinating time, this is a very quick dish. I’m lazy, so I used lemongrass paste, but I don’t think it changed the flavor. My pack of chicken thighs was 2lbs and there was plenty of marinade for all of it. I grilled 4 minutes on the first side, 5 minutes on the second side, and then let the meat rest for a few minutes. Wonderful taste. I served with coconut rice and sautéed onions and shiitake mushrooms. This is going on our regular rotation!
2596	312	Delish!!! I didn't have fresh lemongrass, so I made it with 1tbsp lemongrass powder instead. It was very fragrant and flavorful. Definitely making it again.
2597	313	Would use a little less vodka in exchange for more 7up
2598	313	Made this for my wife. She loved it. This is definitely on the "by the pitcher" lost
2599	313	This recipe is wonderful!  In a pinch because I didn't have fresh oranges I used oracle juice with pulp...so refreshing!!!
2600	313	Excellent!!!   Make it better by using a snow ball machine on the ice
2601	313	so good. put a lil whip cream on top, taste like an orange creamsicle.
2602	313	we always make this at the beach and it's awesome
2603	313	Orange crushes are the best! But, a true crush has CRUSHED ice. Sounds simple, but it makes a HUGE difference. Cheers :)
2604	313	This is a summer staple cocktail around my house! I've been drinking them probably a bit more than I should!
2605	313	One of the best cocktails I have ever had.
2606	314	So delicious!  This might be the best pie I ever ate.  Followed the recipe closely since it was my first time making it, although I didn't have unsalted butter, used salted butter & no extra salt instead.  Used a 9 1/2" deep-dish pie pan with raspberries, blueberries, & blackberries.  I had an extra 1/2c or so of berries after rinsing them, so threw them in - glad I did.  It made a nice single layer in the pan.  After splitting the dough in half & sprinkling it on top, I had extra dough (?).  I didn't have any overflow after it started to bubble, another 5 minutes to brown the top, then removed it.  The 2t of cornstarch worked for me, I was able to slice it like a pie.  So glad I tried the recipe.  Next time I make it, I will be more generous with the crust/crumble & buttering the pan.  Excellent!!  As they say, a definite keeper :>)
2607	314	This was one of my staple desserts when I was a chef down in Lakeview Oregon a couple of years ago. I was told by at least over 85% of our customers that was the best dessert they've ever had. Thanks Chef John, love your program and insight to food
2608	314	I made it already 20 times, at least. A really nice recipe. Since I don't always have all three types of berries suggested by Chef John, sometimes I replace some two by plums or a grated apple. This works out fine, though I would not skip raspberries. Also, the short cut of using self-raising flour (without salt and baking powder) works well, unless you confuse it with the usual flour...
2609	314	This just did not taste good. I followed recipe exactly. I'm a frequent baker as well. But the crumb was tasteless.
2610	314	I made this last night as my husband has been reminding me that we need to use up the berries in the freezer. I followed the recipe exactly as is, without any changes, except that I cut it in half. I also topped it with homemade whipping cream. It was super delicious!  I only have one thing to say to those people that omitted the pinch of cayenne pepper…DON’T! It’s very subtle but just what it needed to give it a little extra punch of flavor! I’ll definitely make it again! (My husband made sure I saved it!) ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
2611	314	What a terrific recipe!  It is so easy and so good.  A steady supply of berries of all sorts has had me looking for some good and easy recipes and this recipe is it.  I sometime half the crumble recipe  and it is still wonderful.
2612	314	Great recipe, turned out delicious!
2613	314	This Berry Crumble is beyond ultimate.  I followed the directions, except I left out the cayenne.  I also followed the instructions that Chef John gave on the video. This recipe is a keeper, for sure!
2614	314	This recipe is a great base for the crumble (as I like a bottom to my crumble). It’s definitely does not have enough fruit though and I’m not a huge fan of tons of fruit in my crumbles. 3 cups seemed to skimpy compared to the amount of crumble when you mixed it up. I doubled the filling  amount (6 cups, double lemon juice, double sugar etc). I also Replaced the white sugar with brown sugar in the crumble and added a dash of cinnamon. I Replaced brown butter in place of the regular butter (I use 1 cup brown butter as you tend to loose some butter when you brown it (brown then freeze, don’t use hot melted brown butter) . I also added oats to the second half of the crumble (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. I also add enough vinegar to make it more wet).  You can replace the 6 cups fruit with any variety you want. I’ve done peach blueberry strawberry. Apple raspberry and blueberry etc. it’s absolutely divine the way I’ve altered it! I highly recommend trying it my way as brown butter is life! Even if you don’t want brown butter as the comments suggested double the fruit amount. I’ve made it like 5 times now my way lol. I like my crumble crispy so I turned on the Broiler for a second too.
2934	350	This is delicious.  My family loves it. I added some old bay, garlic powder and salt and pepper,  it is perfect.
2615	315	This is one of the MOST delicious, refreshing cakes ever! My sister made it and I immediately asked her to send me the recipe! I will def follow the instructions below though- adding orange extract and halving the oil. The oil def seems like overkill but then again this cake is absolutely divine as is.
2616	315	I made mine with  vanilla cake mix and chopped up pecans for the cake portion. That made it so much tastier.
2617	315	Delicious! I used a lemon cake mix and I sprinkled coconut flakes and sliced almonds on top as well as mandarin slices.
2618	315	I followed the recipe, and it turned out wonderful.
2619	315	Loved the recipe.  I admit I have been making this same cake for 20 years.    The only thing I do differently is use the Duncan Hines Supreme Orange cake mix rather than yellow.    I still love this cake.
2620	315	Just made it and the topping is very watery So now I have to try and get it to wear it will stay on the cake Maybe put some powder sugar on it Not happy with this one
2621	315	I made this recipe for our Super Bowl party this past Sunday.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  I took the advise of the review that mentioned  reducing the oil to 3/4 C & adding orange extract. Reducing the oil did not work for me. The cake was too dry! I did add the orange extract & even grated in about 2 TBSP of fresh orange zest. The cake itself was still lacking in flavor. (Also - boxed cake mixes are now reduced to 15+ oz, not 18.  I looked it up & discovered that the extra 3 oz was 1/2 C, so I had a 2nd box & added that.) Maybe it would have been more moist without it?  Hard to say.
2622	315	I switched a few things instead of yellow cake I used Duncan Hines orange supreme & instead of instant vanilla  pudding I used instant jello cream cheese and I made it a 3.. round 8" pans and made it a triple layer cake EVERYONE loved it & is requesting it for our annual Mardi party..enjoy & eat cake!!!
2623	315	This is my special birthday cake every year when I was young so I was glad to find a recipe came out so yummy
2624	316	Very soothing for a cold - like the taste overall and will continue to make when feeling better!
2625	316	Families fighting the flu here. Used two lemons. Maybe because they were small. Dissolved a couple zinc lozenges, added Bourbon/Whiskey to individual serving and “Bam” my Big Mama’s  Hot Toddy!!!
2626	316	Absolutely great
2627	316	Great. Pity the pgoto couldn't fitt.
2628	316	Hooked on this  warming, soothing, satisfying and simple drink!
2629	316	I've been having some allergy issues the past few days, and this tea really helped clear some of those sinuses! I really like this. It's spicy, and lemony, and just a feel-good drink. I only used like a drop of honey, as I'm not a big 'sweet' person, and that was perfect for me. I also like that it takes less than 10 minutes to make. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!
2630	316	Very happy with this tea; have the flu and made this to boost the immune system - great flavor.
2631	316	I did not add the cinnamon. This not only taste delicious, but soothes a sore throat.
2632	316	I like it a lot. I added a tad more fresh, grated ginger root and more fresh lemon juice. Its going to be our new winter and fall drink. We will even try the fresh orange juice and probably ice it in the hot summer and spring months.
2633	317	These look beautiful, so maybe I’ll use them as a decorative garnish, but I don’t like eating them. They’re tough and much too sweet. Maybe boiling them for a lot longer would soften them up to a palatable texture, and I wonder if sprinkling a little citric acid along with the sugar would bring back some brightness to the lemon flavor.
2634	317	Worked out well.I mixed the leftover sugar syrup with the reserved lemon juice to make a tasty syrup. Waste not want not!
2635	317	Just perfect. I followed exactly the recipe and they tasted wonderful. I did let them simmer a bit longer as I was busy. I will shake them in sugar tomorrow before putting on a lemon cheesecake as a garnish Thank you
2636	317	Super tasty and super easy. Totally addictive flavour. I ended up eating them all as candy!
2637	317	Made it following the recipe. The pith is not removed as some may have suggested. It was boiled until translucent and perfect. I coated with sugar and used as a garnish for lemon curd cheese cake. Perfect!
2638	317	This was  not difficult, you want some of the white on it (the boiling helps take the bitterness out). I took the hint from someone else and boiled for the 5 mins each time and then, when it was time to do the sugar water simmer, it didn't take long at all, because it was already transparent...so I'll do that from now on.  Great recipe
2639	317	I make this recipe often. I love that I can make a yummy treat instead of throwing away the peel after juicing the lemons. I thinly slice the juiced lemons, this leaves a bit of the pulp attached but I think that adds to the candy. I find that if I boil the peel for at least 5 minutes each time I change the water it makes the peel much more tender.
2640	317	I use these candied peels on top of my lemon pound cake. I was surprised the first time i served them how many people love candied peels! I have also used vanilla sugar to coat the peels.
2641	317	If you make your own Hot Cross Buns, Mincemeat, Stollen, Fruit Cake, or anything else calling for candied peel, the home made version makes a huge flavour difference.
2642	318	Great salmon recipe! Repeat request by my boys after they discovered they actually love salmon. I didn't have parsley but I put lemon slices and sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the fish before I wrapped it and put it in the oven; this was lovely.  And I only used 2 tsp of brown sugar, increased the juice to that of a whole lemon ( which was 3 and 1/2 Tablespoons) and used 2 and 1/2 tsp of minced garlic from a jar since that's easier.  For the thicker pieces of salmon, I cooked them 35 minutes and the thinner pieces I put in for 25 minutes and wrapping them in two different packets worked great.
2643	318	This salmon was good, except I think next time I wouldn't include the brown sugar. The other ingredients are so savory, the sugar seemed out of place. But loved the cooking technique!
2644	318	This is a great way to make salmon. The Flash was very tender and moist not over or undercooked. I'm going to try the same method with some different spices. Very good thank you!
2645	318	No changes
2646	318	This turned out very good.  Easy  with few ingredients.  I made step for step.  We will make again.
2647	318	My kids were happy with it!
2648	318	Excellent and simple! The salmon was moist and the blend of seasonings was delicious - and just a little unique. Definitely a "keeper" for my family and an excellent choice for a company or special occasion dinner.
2858	342	This is the second time making this recipe in two weeks, it comes out perfect every single time. Tastes delicious aswell ❤️❤️
2649	318	I am not a very good cook and our oven is a full 50 degrees too cool, so cooking is always fraught with potential awfulness.  But this came out well!   I substituted 1 TBSP maple syrup and 1 teaspoon of dill for the brown sugar and oregano, respectively, and it came out tasting lovely.  A little heavy for my liking; I might forego the garlic next time or use less of it.  All in all a good recipe.
2650	318	Made exactly as written, just skipped the parsley. It was easy and delicious!
2651	319	Excellent! I like that it wasn't too sweet.  Easy to follow instructions. I had to add a 1/4 cup more juice to the batter and topped it with an orange glaze. It turned out absolutely amazingly delicious. The family loved it!
2652	319	Made this into muffins and a loaf. Added 3Tbsextra butter, softened)  and twice the orange zest cuz we like it that way. Whip butter and 1 1/2 cup extra sugar,, then beat egg innto that. Slowly stir in flower (don't overmix) Very yummy, will make again for holidays, not just winter, Easter too.
2653	319	I love the taste of cranberry and orange, and the balance of those is pleasing in this bread.  As others suggested, I doubled the amount of cranberries, used 1C of orange juice, added 1/2t of cinnamon, substituted vegetable oil for the butter, and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  It was easy to double the recipe and freeze one of the delicious loaves for later.
2654	319	Everyone loved it and so easy to make!!! 😍😋Like others recommended I added a cup of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and I added 1/4 cup of fresh Orange 🍊 juice from the orange I used for the zest. Yummy 😋
2655	319	Good flavor but too dry. I would say cook less than 50 minutes. I now read the comments and agree that more cranberries would be good and maybe more orange juice as the batter was very thick.
2656	319	I have never made Orange Cranberry Bread before. This turned out very well, and my family loved it. It is bursting with flavor and has a good texture. I put an orange glaze over the top - I just mixed a little orange juice with confectioners sugar until the desired consistency. I had a little more than a cup of cranberries so used all of them. One thing I would change in the future would be to melt the butter before incorporating into the mixture - cubed butter was hard to blend in.
2657	319	absolutely the best I have ever made!!  I made mini loaves and glazed them with  an orange glaze while still warm and there are no words to describe the delicious  treat these were... All Recipes never fails to produce the greatest of recipes... always has been and always will be my go to site . I did chop my cranberries in my food processor and added , I like them chopped rather than whole.
2658	319	So easy, so good!
2659	319	Followed the steps all the way just used thawed out frozen cranberries. Turned out very good. Bread texture just right and it was delicious. Will make again  thank  you
2660	320	I made it and it was excellent.  Next time I may cut the sugar by two cups for 4 lbs of baerries.THe lemon juice was great but I used arrowroot too.
2661	320	Loved it!!
2662	320	I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out absolutely perfect!  I am amazed!  I wonder if I can use this method for other fruit jams as well?
2663	320	Delicious, will definitely make again.
2664	320	Came out pure runny! ☹️
2665	320	Didn't change a thing and LOVED it!  So simple and delicious, and you can easily adjust recipe to accommodate more or less raspberries.  Four cups of berries made four small mason jars of jam.
2666	320	Great start however I made the following changes:A) cut the sugar by about halfB) I cooked it for about 15 min on high stirring constantlyIt hardened beautifully and tastes amazing!
2667	320	Easy to make and delicious! The recipe only makes 4.5 8 oz jars, not 7. I will make this again.
2668	320	My bread machine has a jam setting, so I made this recipe in it. I made two batches, the first 1C raspberry, 1 C sugar and 1tsp lemon juice. It thickened too much and was too sweet, but still very good. The second batch, I used half the sugar and what an explosion of flavour! Raspberry jam is my favourite. Homemade raspberry jam is the only kind I'll eat from now on. So easy in the machine too! This was the first time I'd ever made jam and can't believe how easy it is. Thanks for forgetting the pectin and giving us this great recipe.
2669	321	This recipe was good and easy to follow with one simple direction. It says to use 4 oranges for 3 servings, but you should add more oranges than in the directions. I recommend to add ice.
2670	321	poggers
2671	321	Amazing
2672	321	Took a little while to make and makes very little, but it is SOOOOO worth it. Helps to add a TINY bit of sugar.
2673	321	I didn't make changes
2674	321	I looked up how to make OJ, because I never made it before. I thought you had to boil the fresh squeezed juice to pastureize it, add water and some sugar and then cool it to make 2 quarts to 1/2 gallon but, I guess you don’t, thank you for sharing!
2675	321	I did only 1 orange I used a juicer and smacked the orange against my hand still was good
2676	321	I was actually making orange syrup and didn't want to waste the oranges.
2677	321	Super easy and super delicious! I also added some tangerines.
2678	322	Since I like chicken with a lemony flavor I knew this soup was for me!  I made a half batch with a few changes to suit my taste.   Since I like lemon I increased the amount but left out the onion.  Sometimes onion overpowers soup.  I kept the orzo separate since I do that with all soups.   The flavor is delicious and more tasty than regular chicken soup…. My new favorite soup recipe!  I look forward to making this for my family.
2679	322	This is delicious. My 7 year old thought so too. Added chard and okra, didn’t have spinach. Tasty. Will add to rotation of chicken soups.
2680	322	I would love to say I followed the recipe exactly, but I was missing a few ingredients, so I improvised. I didn't have broth so I used chicken bouillon and a couple of veggie bouillon since I was out of celery and only had 1/2 an onion. I also cooked the chicken and orzo in the broth, and I only added maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice to it because my hubby isn't a fan of lemon, and I figured I can always add more to my bowl. Hubby tasted the soup, and he likes it!Will make this again, hopefully with the proper ingredients.
2681	322	Delicious!My 9yo grandson's favorite soup.He calls it "Green Soup" because of the spinach. He has taken it to school for lunch so many times his teacher asked for the recipe.He said, "For a 4th grader to get that excited over a thermos of soup, it must be good".
2682	322	Absolutely amazing! I just added 1 teaspoon of the rosemary and oregano instead of 1/2 teaspoon as we love herbs. We have tried a couple other recipes and this will be our go to for sure : )
3008	358	Super easy  dessert. I used 1 can if  peaches and 1 of plums. I also sprinkled chopped  pecans before butter.
2683	322	So so good. My only change would yo not "pre make" the orzo. Because the orzo cooks so fast you can add it to the recipe uncooked when you add the chicken. It will cook in less than 10 min w everything else.
2684	322	I absolutely love this soup, and think it's a great variation of regular chicken noodle or rice soup.  I used the white meat from a rotisserie chicken, and added extra lemon juice (which gave it a brighter flavor).  I'll definitely be adding this to my favorite soup recipes!
2685	322	Yum !! made this for bible study, everyone loved it and asked me to make it again !!
2686	322	Fantastic!! I did not change anything
2687	323	Simple straightforward recipe, but, most of all delicious and moist!  Put some lemon glaze on top and it was irresistible!
2688	323	Excellent recipe. The cake was delicious and everything is from scratch. Nothing is artificial flavors. I made lemon Glaze to finish it off. Thank you 😊
2689	323	I baked them in small ramequins in air frier. Came out perfect.
2690	323	It was easy to follow. I added a little extra to mine. I added grated coconut just to give it a little crunch. It turned out spongy. My wife loved it. I will definitely make this a constant
2691	323	The tangy flavour of the lemon zest offsets the sweetness of the cake. Definitely a recipe to repeat.
2692	323	Yum! I did this in my stand mixer and it turned out great! I topped it with lemon glaze and blueberry coulis.
2693	323	This cake turned out to be a BIG hit!I made some alterations,which made my cake moist,and tangy.I added 1/4 cup of vegetable oil to the mix. Also used 3 lemons for the zest,and 4 TBS of lemon juice.Also baked it for the total of 40 minutes. And to top it off,I made a lemon glaze frosting,Thank you for sharing your ideas because that's how my cake was a success.
2694	323	I like the taste I added extra lemon so it was stronger flavour and halved the sugar so it wasn't so sweet. Mine came out dense but I don't mind cakes like that. I have a feeling the reason for some they come out dense and didn't really rise. I think it is to do with the amount of baking powder...recipe says 1 3/4 TSP, however the brand of baking powder I used actually says on the container that it requires 2tsp/1 cup of flour so maybe next time I'll try follow the baking powder directions for the brand I bought I stead of in the recipe and see if that makes a difference.
2695	323	If you love Lemon desserts you will love this cake. The description at the top of the recipe is Right On! It's Super moist! I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did add a Lemon glaze after it cooled, but I'm sure its not necessary, just little whipped cream would also be good.  Good thing I made it for someone else, otherwise I could have eaten the whole thing!
2696	324	Delicious! Added a cup more of chicken and used orzo instead of rice. Everyone loved it!
2697	324	More of a question why do I need Chicken Broth and Soup Base? 6 tablespoons of Soup base seems like a lot given all the salt it contains.
2698	324	I've been making this for at least 15 years and I'm pretty sire this is the exact recipe I started with. It makes children and adults happy! Haha! And if you're getting it too salt, adjust your broth and stock! I always use low sodium broth so I don't have this problem.
2699	324	Better than the local Greek restaurant!!  I will be making this soup regularly!!
2700	324	The Best!  I used Meyer Lemons and it was to die for!
2701	324	Loved this soup.
2702	324	This recipe was yummy and easy to follow, thank you.
2703	324	Absolutely perfect! I followed the recipe to a tee and it couldn’t be any better!
2704	324	This recipe has WAY too much salt in it!  I had never used chicken soup base before, but I thought I would follow this recipe fully.  I think that perhaps 2 tablespoons of that soup base would possibly be too much.  It was hard to swallow with the extreme salinity!  I tried to doctor it up with adding more water, carrots and rice....still not too much of a comfort.
2705	325	Great lemon flavor in a soft, buttery cookie. After my first sheet, I decided to reduce the size of the cookies and double chill the cookies before baking - chilling again after rolling and placing the cookies on a pan. I didn’t press the cookies before baking either. This helped keep the cookies from flattening.I think the next time I cook these, I’ll add a bit more flour to help them keep more height. They are sweet and lemony enough that a bit more flour won’t hurt.
2706	325	Excellent cookie and nice flavor w/1 tsp of Lemon Extract. Won't waste an extra lemon just for the zest,Also added 1 tsp of Cream of Tartar as we like our cookies light. Still moist and chewy but a bit lighter.Great recipe, thanks for sharing.
2707	325	Used gf flour and thought this was one of the best cookies I've made (and I've made a lot). 10/10
2708	325	I am gluten and egg free, so I replaced the egg with applesauce. I think next time, I won’t push them down so much. They were a little flat, but moist, soft, and delicious!! I used only one lemon, but it was still “too lemony” for my 4 year old. 😂
2709	325	Delicious cookie, don’t be shy on the lemon zest. Added a simple lemon glaze to half of the cookies. Yum!
2710	325	Great Cookies, my grandparents love them! I used the zest of three lemons and it seemed to be just right, very lemony.
2711	325	Made these cookies for a work Cookie exchange! I substituted vegan butter (from Trader Joe's), reduced sugar to 3/4 cup, and added a lemon glaze (1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, 1tbsp vegan butter). Mine did not have the white crackling on top, but the glaze made up for it! I used the juice and zest from 2 lemons and they were very lemony and chewy!  I would rate this recipe as medium difficulty for the stickiness of batter and extra step of rolling in powdered sugar. Amazing lemon flavor !
2712	325	Made with gluten free flour and they were so delicious
2713	325	The best lemon cookies ever! They are cake like but chewy at the same time. Don’t overwork the dough and don’t over bake. I add lemon extract to mine.  I don’t “smash lightly”, that’s funny. Actually leaving them in a ball is best. I Highly recommend this recipe. My husbands friends are in love with them. 💛🍋
2714	326	I used pineapple tidbits instead of crushed because that's what I had on hand. Very cool and refreshing on a warm day!
2715	326	this is a light , delicious dessert and so easy to make
2716	326	Loved this dessert as a kid. Glad I found it again! Sugar free Jello and low fat cottage cheese makes it a pretty guilt free dessert. Super easy!
2717	326	My aunt made this for years but used whipped cream,  added sliced green olives ( with pimento) and thinly sliced almonds.  The added  olives  are the best!
2887	345	Banana chips can be heated or seared. Anyway heating may take somewhat more time than browning. Conjointly southern style banana chips taste magnificent.
2718	326	One of my family favorites for many, many years!  It is a must to have on the table at every holiday!   Many don't even eat it, but it has to be on the table!  It is also a good recipe to start those young cooks on... and it's delicious!!
2719	326	My favorite 🍰
2720	326	My only change was using raspberry jello, the only flavor I had on hand. It was so delicious, though, that I'll use it again next time.... and there WILL be a next time!
2721	326	Love this recipe. Grew up with it as a child. However I changed to raspberry jello and fresh raspberries.  Worked just as perfect!
2722	326	Easy and so good.
2723	327	Easy and excellent. I made as is, but increased the sauce by 1.5. Perfect amount for us.
2724	327	I made it as directed nice but very mild
2725	327	Very quick and easy. I didn’t have lemon so I just left it out, and I added some green and red peppers, flavor was still very tasty. Kids ate it and asked for seconds.
2726	327	Family loved it! No changes necessary. I used thighs instead of breasts since that’s what was thawed, but I’ll use breasts next time.
2727	327	Used chicken tenderloins. It was wonderful and so easy. Ate w/rice and sauteed vegies from the garden.
2728	327	M.hk
2729	327	We really like this recipe. I do triple the sauce though. Love the sauce! Thanks to whoever came up with this one.
2730	327	Family favorite! It has such a great taste. I was very shocked when it said ketchup, but it is great dish for anyone.
2731	327	I always make an AR.com recipe first time per instructions out of sincere respect to the recipe creator.  I saw right away I would have to double the sauce--which was so yummy, that I abandoned a moment of caution and added another round to my doubled sauce---which kinda had for me a "Polynesian" kind of flavor, where some pineapple chunks would nicely suit it; I'll give that a try next time---thank you, Anny!!
2732	328	I will never cook Salmon any other way again. I stuffed mine with fresh dill instead of basil.
2733	328	425 degrees for 15 min at the most!!!
2734	328	This is my wife and my favorite fish recipe. We always make this with vegetables from our garden. We use fresh cilantro, parsley, basil, and plenty of butter and lemon with garlic. We also put thin sliced jalapeño on it.I cook it on the lower oven rack and check it every 10 minutes. Just cook it until the safe cooking temperature and then you will find that it turns out fantastic!
2735	328	With four servings, a little over .75 lb each, the recipe worked perfectly. 25 minutes: firm, moist, delicious. No fishy kitchen. Only thing I changed was brush-on olive oil ‘cause I had no spray.Now I see how well this works, next time -  one big piece of salmon.
2736	328	Still too dry and this was my second attempt. I’ll take Damon’s advice next time. I did reduce the time by one minute, but it was not enough.
2737	328	This was simple and fresh!  I just adjusted the time. I cooked two 6 oz salmon pieces for 15 minutes and they were absolutely perfect.
2738	328	Timing was perfect.  Taste delicious.
2739	328	very easy recipe
2740	328	Outstanding and so simple!  I didn't have fresh basil so I lightly sprinkled dry basil and it was perfect.
2741	329	Excellent. I made without salt because I am salt intolerant and used garlic power powder instead of garlic salt.
2742	329	Easy; quick. Add oven baked seasoned salmon and rice from the InstaPot. Easy. Quick. Hmmm... My own canned green beans. Yeah, you guessed it. Easy; quick.We had a gourmet meal in minutes.
2743	329	Good, quick meal with great flavor.  Used Olive Oil, fresh garlic and 1/4 C fresh lemon juice, salt & pepper.  Flash cooked served with ricearoni and it was lovely
2744	329	It was delicious...they came out lemony buttery delicious...I may have added a tinch more lemon juice...But nonetheless, me and the kids loveeeeddddd it!
2745	329	I made it
2746	329	Use real garlic.
2747	329	Exactly as directed with Zatarains yellow rice.  Very good
2748	329	Great recipe! Super easy and very tasty!  I used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.
2749	329	I added cayenne pepper and served over yellow rice with spinach and mushrooms. Delicious
2750	330	This is one of my favorite go to recipes.  Most of the time I swap out the chicken for a white fish like cod, mahi mahi, tilapia, or flounder.  I always make about double the sauce as I also cook angel hair pasta and put the fish on top with the lemon caper sauce.  My family and I LOVE this dish and eat it along with green bean almandine.
2751	330	Simple and easy. We loved it!
2752	330	I love lemon and pepper together so I added freshly ground black pepper to olive oil prior to heating, and also put a light sprinkle of garlic powder on the chicken after I added it to the pan. Served with buttered angel hair pasta and also had parmesan available.My husband must have enjoyed, as he has thanked me four times already for this dinner (he never does that.)Will def make this again! Thanks for a fairly simple and very delicious recipe.
2753	330	delicious and quick an d easy.  I added garlic powder to the chicken.
2754	330	this is an excellent recipe been using it for years but I never just make 2 pieces. I end up making 8 to 10 pieces. Did they take away the ability to modify the servings?
2755	330	Super easy, I made the recipe as is.  My family loved it.
2756	330	I used Chicken Thighs (It's what I had) I followed the recipe as much as I could, but cooked the chicken a little longer because it had bone and skin. Then after the chicken was cooked to the bone, I put it in the air fryer for about 5 minutes on 400 just to crisp up the skin a little. It was delicious. Very flavorful. I served it with Angel Hair Pasta.
2757	330	I love this recipe because it was so simple and inexpensive. The ingredients are all on your pantry so there is no need to go to the grocery store. This was delicious! It’s definitely going on my saves.
2758	330	This was really good. I used thin cut chicken breasts and substituted chicken broth for the white wine because I didn't have any. After the capers were added to the pan, I stirred in a little extra chicken broth so there would be sauce. My family liked it a a lot.
2759	331	I used a 5 lb chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was nice and crispy. And the gravy was yummy, thanks to the wine!!
2792	334	I loved these.  I’m not a fan of lemon so I swirled some eras berry jam thru the cream cheese mixture.  I didn’t have a problem with the bottom crust but I’m making them tomorrow for a family dinner so I’ll try pre cooking the bottom crust this time just to see if I like them better.  This time I’m going to use a blueberry compote.
2760	331	I think butterflying/spatchcocking is the best way to cook a chicken.  Cooked for 50 minutes and let stand for 10 minutes during which time the temperature rose a bit more to get to 165 degrees.  I salted it on top of and under the skin with kosher salt and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to draw out the moisture for the crispiest skin. It's important to use a young 3-4 lb fryer versus an older/heavier roasting hen which will turn out stringy and tough due to the short cooking time.
2761	331	So bland.  No go.
2762	331	I think this recipe works better with a smaller bird. I like how simple and flavorful this recipe is. Don't be afraid to remove the backbone of a chicken. It's easier than it seems.
2763	331	The best roast chicken recipe anywhere. Easier than whole roast chicken and more accessible carving meat. Punished young son once by saying if you don’t pick up your room no roast chicken. Clean room!
2764	331	The thigh/drumstick were great, but the breasts took way longer.  I had hoped the butterflying would do the trick to equalize cooking times, but I did have a 5+lb  bird, so I don't know about a true fryer.
2765	331	After reading the reviews I decided to make this in a cast iron skillet. Great flavour in the drumsticks and thighs but the flavour didn't come through in the breast meat and no one cared for the flavour of the drippings, perhaps it was my lemons but it was very bitter. Thanks for sharing.
2766	331	Very tender chicken, evenly cooked throughout.
2767	331	This was delicious...super easy...and hubby had extra servings until he couldn't eat anymore!  Definitely do again!
2768	332	Very Delicious!
2769	332	This was great thank you so much!
2770	332	So simple, yet very tasty and satisfying! I loved it!
2771	332	5.23.20  The title of this recipe is a bit of a misnomer to me because it has no tea in it.  My mother used to give us something similar to this when we were kids and had the sniffles and sore throats.  I skipped the sugar because the honey provided more than enough sweetness for me.  Enjoyed a cup of this for breakfast this morning, and I don’t even have a sore throat.  Simple, but just really tasty.
2772	332	I left out the sugar, and it was just sweet enough for me. I was surprised how much I liked this, and it did soothe my scratchy throat.
2773	332	Great! Use more lemon then it sais and I first boiled the water and then put the ingredients in.
2774	332	Its to hot to try just yet but i mad it for a pretty bad cough hoping it will help smooth it so I can get some rest!
2775	332	It's really good and tasty I love it so much thanks and it can help with my sore throat thanks once more
2776	332	This tea is very good! I made it exactly as recommended. Soothing on a sore or scratchy throat. I do not add any sugar as the honey adds a nice sweetness.
2777	333	1 X 8oz  package of softened cream cheese1 stick (1/2 cup) of softened unsalted butter1 teaspoon of vanilla extract2 ounces of lemon juice (fresh lemon)Lemon zest from 1 large lemon1.5 cups of confectionery sugar (added as mixing on mixer with enough to make sweet our taste)You can place in fridge to stiffen up a bit before you use if needed.We like tangy and fluffy and less sweet. This adjustment worked well for the lemon cake.
2778	333	I, too, found this too thin and way to sweet, but it was good.When I make it again, I think I'll try 2 packages of cream cheese to thicken it and way less sugar.The thinner version I think would be good as a topping for waffles as a brunch or dessert.
2779	333	Perfect. Used 3c confectioners sugar
2780	333	Followed the recipe to the letter and it was fabulous.  Thank you.
2781	333	Made a lemon cake and this frosting for my son. Everyone loved it. It's a keeper.
2782	333	Perfect texture for piping, excellent flavor.  This will be a keeper!
2783	333	This is tasty frosting, but I did not have real lemons, so I used lemon juice from a jar (4 T) along with 1 tsp or so of real vanilla extract. I used the 8 oz cream cheese and half stick (1/4 c) butter, but I had to use more than 5 cups of sugar. Even then, it wasn't super thick for piping. I envy those who got theirs to be stiff and able to stand tall.  I put a little yellow food coloring in mine to make it a pale, pale yellow color. I used this frosting to top lemon cupcakes and strawberry-filled (preserves) lemon cupcakes.
2784	333	It was way too runny, was more like glazing than frosting, ruined my cake decorating plans.
2785	333	It was great! I only used about 3 cups of sugar instead of 5 but it was still enough to frost a 6" 3-layer cake! The frosting wasn't super stiff but I'm sure adding more sugar would have fixed that.
2786	334	How is it was to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SO VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2787	334	I like lemon so I used the zest of 3 lemons and the juice of 4 lemons and found them to be perfect. One of my favorite dessert recipes so far.
2788	334	I thought the end result was terrific and the process was so easy! (I just had to try one almost the minute I took them out of the oven!) These bars turned out lemony and not too sweet. In recipes like this that call for the crescents to be rolled out in one piece, I always use the sheets vs. the individual rolls. That makes a big difference! I was so tempted to add an egg to the filling because I have made similar recipes in the past that called for one. I DID NOT add any eggs and the filling was perfect! I didn't think the bars turned out "doughy" as a few others have mentioned. However, I did not line my pan (I used a glass 9x13) with foil. Perhaps that made a difference in how the crescent dough cooked on the bottom. I'm certain I will make this recipe again!
2789	334	I did make a few changes to suit my baking tastes. Instead of using the entire roll of dough, I only placed enough to cover the bottom. Then buttered it lightly as I pressed it into place, with a small amount of sugar  sprinkled on top. Prick the dough so it doesn't puff up in the oven. Bake just until it starts to lightly brown, then cool completely. I increased my sugar to one and one quarter cup to balance out the quarter cup of lemon juice. I added the one egg as suggested by another reviewer. I also added one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and grated in a small amount of nutmeg. Finished off with an eighth of a teaspoon of lemon extract. I wanted the lemon flavor to be pronounced! Again with the second roll of dough, used only enough to cover the top. I used kitchen shears to cut up pieces of dough to fill in any open spots. The end result was great, with a crispy top and bottom and no sogginess from too much dough. I'll save the extra crescent dough for rolls, lol.
2790	334	This was so easy to make and delicious.  I took it to a gathering where there were several desserts, and this was gone in no time!
2791	334	This was a very good dessert. Took other reviewers' advice and baked the bottom layer first, let cool, then proceeded as directed in the original recipe, no soggy crust and overall good lemony taste, no bitterness. Thank you for a good recipe!
2793	334	Yes I used a very generic brand of crescent rolls that did not stretch so I used more than called for on the bottom layer, baked that layer immediately to a nice golden brown then took it out to cool while I made the filling, so another thick layer of generic brand crescent rolls covered the top for the crust, so I used 4 tablespoons of butter to brush on top , then mixed the zest, white sugar and a touch of nutmeg together to sprinkle on top of the raw buttered crescent rolls , spots left a bit open I sprinkled a light amount of sugar on the bare open areas for consistency. Then I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes, took it out to set, then my grandson wanted a taste after 20 minutes and so did I , it was very delicious, very unusual in an unexpected good flavor. I never knew these generic brand crescent rolls would ever transform into a lovely dessert bar such as this. This is a true story from me, an old lady who taught myself to find recipes on Pinterest and like to share them with my , I got a thumbs up on this recipe and it was rated a ten!
2794	334	Made this yesterday, very easy to make. Family loved it!!
2795	335	I used cod and could not even taste the freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, only lemon pepper seasoning. Adding the juices to the fish at the beginning and then flipping the fillets left you with zero fresh juice flavor.  This cooks so quickly that there’s no time for the juice to infuse the fish and when you flip to the other side to finish cooking, the juice just quickly evaporates…hope that makes sense to you.  If I were to make this again (unlikely), I’d wait until the fish is nearly cooked on the other side and then drizzle with the juices.  It also could use a garnish of some sort like chopped parsley or cilantro, has no eye appeal.
2796	335	I have made this many times and it always tastes great.  The only change is that I use blood orange olive oil.
2797	335	Absolutely love this recipe with any white fish
2798	335	Good recipe. I tweeked it to my liking and my calorie intake. I sprayed the fish and shrimp (I used 8 oz of raw shrimp also) with butter spray and seasoned with old bays, Ground himalyan pink salt, fresh grpund pepper, lemon pepper and I also used a little garlic powder on the shrimp.  I used 1.5 tsp of olive oil, 3 cloves garlic (2 minced, 1 sliced) 5-6 chopped leaves of fresh basil. I warmed it all up in the oil before adding the fish, shrimp and juice. Fish cooked for 5 minutes added shrimp at halfway mark.
2799	335	Very simple and yummy.  Added a little garlic salt too.
2800	335	Delicious. Extremely easy to prepare. This is a great quick after work dinner.
2801	335	This was delicious, no changes were necessary.  Everyone loved it.  We will definitely make this again.
2802	335	Super easy and super good. Didn't need to change anything!
2803	335	I crushed it up and it was amazing
2804	336	Followed the recipe with one substitution, I'm out of lemons so I used a mandarin orange.  It was fine.  Family ate it and said they'd eat it again if it was served. That's a successful dish in my book!!
2805	336	I added Garlic powder, fresh basil and oregano to the pieces after basting them with olive oil and they tasted good.  I brushed a few with lemon after roasting but did not like the taste of them with this addition.
2806	336	I love eggplant but was so tired of fried eggplant.  This recipe is great - you can eat it hot or cold.
2807	336	I made this in air fryer and sliced instead of quartered! Was delicious and so simple.
2808	336	This was easy but tasted too bland. Needed to add more seasoning to make it worth trying again. There are other eggplant recipes I will try before  I will make this again.
2809	336	Delicious! I used black truffel olive oil(great on most veggies), a crumbly garlic herb seasoning, dash of garlic salt, ground black pepper, sprinkle of parmesan and a small dash of shredded parmesan.  The small additions are well within my diet :)  Dont forget the fresh lemon squeeze at the end...yum!
2810	336	I absolutely love foods with eggplant but every time I try to make something with it it comes out awful — Eggplant is it done or it tastes funny. But this recipe was successful. The first time I made it, I followed the directions and just made it plain, with the olive oil, salt, pepper, and lemon juice. The second time, I dressed it up with tomato sauce, red pepper flakes, and shredded mozzarella cheese. That was so delicious and very easy. I’m going use this recipe as a base from now on. I guess you could add peppers or mushrooms or something too.
2811	336	This is a great recipe. I did as another reviewer advised, and salted first and then drained after 30 minutes. I add a sliced tomato and a sprinkle of cheese to serve! I have considered roasting the tomato slice for a minute or two, but I haven't done that yet.
2812	336	Yes. I roasted onions and bell peppers.  Sprinkled parmesan Cheese and garlic powder was tasty
2813	337	Terragon is a must here! Try to add some pink pepper to impress people even more! Very good with white flaky fish or scallops.
2814	337	Amazing! Made my own tweaks as follows: 1 whole shallot minced (because I was too lazy to measure it out) and close to 2 T fresh tarragon went into this. The flavors and color was amazing. I served it over pan-seared sea scallops and linguini. (I may or may not have licked the plate clean...)
2815	337	A whole lemon was too much, it made it only taste like lemon. So I say only use half and you can always add. It was more broth like than an actual sauce. So I was a little disappointed about that.  My boyfriend is a professional chef and he said the recipe is backwards and that's why it was so broth like. He said you start with the the butter but then you should follow the recipe backwards.
2816	337	I liked it as an easy scampi sauce. I did not use the targon and I also added a little flour to thicken it and it came out great.
2817	337	Absolutely fantastic sauce for broiled or grilled fish!
2818	337	Pictures made it look like a creamier white sauce, but it turned out runny & clear.  Flavor was OK, but fish flavor was pretty strong to begin with.  Will put leftovers on something else before making a final verdict.
2819	337	This sauce was super easy and so delicious. I placed grilled jumbo shrimp over angel hair pasta then poured the lemon white wine sauce on top. Yum.
2820	337	Very simple to make, wonderful taste. Everyone loved it. I think I could easily vary this recipe by adjusting the proportions of the ingredients  or by making substitutions (like dill, basil or cilantro instead of tarragon). I made this for flounder but I think it would be great on other types of fish as well as on chicken breast.
2821	337	I made it over tilapia and used all the seasons that were in the sauce except for the salt and white pepper,Instead, I put salt-free seasonings and instead of fresh Parsley  I used cilantro. and I put lemon zest over the fish after pouring this sauce over it then it tasted even better with the sweet frozen corn I had as a side veggie.
2822	338	Lemony fruit loop cookies
2823	338	Well, I made this yesterday at my clients house. I am a home care provider for senior citizens. At first, I was extremely disappointed with this recipe it was sticky. It was nothing like the video. So I made four cookies and baked them. The inside was sticky everything was wrong. So I decided to put them in the fridge and see if letting them hang out in the fridge overnight would work and I had a back up recipe for today when I got back to work just in case. So I turn the oven back on got it up to temperature took the cookie batter out of the fridge and it was still sticky but not as bad as yesterday. So I baked them and let them cool then I made the frosting as yesterday. My client did not like the icing sugar she said they were too messy. Anyhow, I made just a simple lemon glaze icing and today after cooling the batter overnight made a huge difference. I will definitely make this recipe again I will just put the batter in the fridge overnight and cook them the next day. I don’t know if maybe it was because my client being in her 80s has the house extremely warm like it is always over 77°F in her house so maybe that’s why they were so sticky I have no idea but it’s a keeper 😊
2824	338	Really dense dough and weird flavor
2825	338	i loved the cookies
2826	338	These cookies were very enjoyable to make from start to finish it only took about  2 and 1/2 hours from beginning and clean up to finish,  Then we had cookies and milk.  Pretty good with ice cream also.  Myself and some grandkids had a lot of fun with this project.
2827	338	Love this recipe. I make it almost every year for the holidays.  I've changed it a bit to fit my preference. I usually use 1.5 teaspoons of the lemon extract instead of 1 so the lemon flavor is stronger. I also use a 1/2 teaspoon to measure out the cookies. Since they're smaller than the original recipe says it usually only takes about 5 minutes for them to be done, but it depends on the oven.
2828	338	These turned out terrible. My cake mix was old; but I don’t think that was the reason.  Don’t make this quick recipe. Make the cookie dough from scratch.
2829	338	The basic recipe was a bit bland, so I made some adjustments.  I added a tablespoon of lemon extract and a rounded teaspoon of fresh lemon zest.  I also made them a bit larger and baked them for twelve minutes on my aluminum  baking sheet  and ten minutes on my Teflon baking sheet.   They are great with the adjustments.
2830	338	Based on other reviews, I replaced the lemon extract with lemon juice and the rind of one whole lemon, then chilled the dough for 1 hour. Baked at 350° for 11 minutes on parchment paper. I made two batches. In the first, I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. In the 2nd, I used 2 Tbsp. It’s really a matter of personal preference. The husband prefers the first batch and I prefer the 2nd, but both are great. They’ve earned a place on this year’s Christmas platter. Thanks for a great idea, Lissa! I’m looking forward to trying this with Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge mix as suggested by another reviewer.
2831	339	Awesome
2832	339	My husband loved it! Since I am a vegetarian, I didn’t dare change anything and ruin it for him, except covering it tightly with foil.
2833	339	Quick/not involved, and always good.
2834	339	This was simply delicious! Usually my husband and I have salmon with only salt and pepper but this glaze really dressed it up without detracting from the flavor of the salmon. Very easy to prepare too!
2835	339	Yes and Yumm. I used double the rosemary and it was great
2836	339	Follow the recipe as stated there was no need to make any changes the only thing I did different was a used steel head instead of salmon just what I had in the freezer
2837	339	My fish guy wasn't there to skin the salmon, so I left the skin on.  Put the lemon and rosemary in the bottom of the pan, not on top.  Ended up with a delicious, perfectly cook piece of fish that was fragrant without the overpowering flavor a double layer of lemon and rosemary would have given it.  Will definitely make this again!
2838	339	I love doing this in foil packs on ther BBQ  to not heat up the house. Very delicious.
2839	339	I put a little of my own spices and it was great...
2840	340	Fantastic!  I usually do not change anything the first time I try a recipe but I did not have red onion or lemons on hand so I used shallots instead of the red onions & garlic.  I also had some green onions that needed to be used so I added the white bits to the chard stems and then added the green ends when I added the chard leaves and instead of lemon, I used champagne vinegar.   This turned out absolutely delicious!  The freshly grated parmesan really added the final touch and I've already ordered more rainbow chard to make again ASAP!
2841	340	This recipe was delicious. I have always boiled swiss chard. I will never boil again. I cooked it exactly as directions said. The second time I made it I added some bacon pieces. Both ways were excellent.
2842	340	Too greasy, two tablespoons of oil and butter ended up being too much.
2843	340	I found it very flavourful.  There was still a little crunchiness to the swiss chard which also added interest to it. We loved it!
2844	340	Delicious. We cut back on the lemon too much, which was a mistake in a recipe with so much butter. I usually find lemon drowns out the flavor of a recipe, so I decreased it to a few drops here, but more was needed to cut the butter. If I make this again, I’ll probably reduce the amount of butter too.
2845	340	Very delicious.  I would like it a little more tender so I let it sit a minute or two longer. Definitely will make this again and again.
2846	340	You can eliminate the butter and won't miss it.  I used a shallot.  Quick and easy side dish.
2847	340	Made as directed by used more chard than called for (pulled from my garden). It was great. My toddler gobbled it down.
2848	340	This is a nice simple recipe for all the Swiss chard my garden is producing!
2849	155	I’ve recently become fond of a Southern Comfort Old Fashioned
2850	155	This is a awesome stiff drink. Takes me back to It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in the air plane scene. Enjoy
2851	155	I’m a booze wimp, so I used 2 sugar cubes in mine, but most love just one. Really yummy. It has become my new favorite cocktail!
2852	155	Love this drink! Best with rye whiskey which has a unique flavor. Nice to find a refreshing whiskey drink!
2853	155	I omit the lemon and the cherry and add 4 dashes of orange bitters with 2 dashes of Angostura bitters. Then I burn the edges of the orange rind before dropping into the glass for a little smoke flavoring
2854	155	Solid recipe. Don't forget to make xlarge ice cubes. Definitely worth it.
2855	155	Solid recipe.
2856	155	Very good. Can also substitute simple syrup for sugar cube and water.
2857	155	I’ve gained ten pounds because of my beloved whiskey sours. I’ve switched to this to save calories. Delicious!
2859	342	Perfection! I don't have a working oven atm so I put it in the air fryer, I just reduced the temp and cooking time by a little and it turned out perfect. So creamy with the perfect texture and just the right amount of citrus-ey brightness. It's a fluffy/creamy cheesecake that has spoilt me for all others.
2860	342	I followed the directions as it was stated. The oy thing i wish my meringue was more fluffy like the picture on thos page. But over all it was delicious 😋
2861	342	Great recipe! Make every year for our football auction fundraiser. Sells well every time!
2862	342	Made this for my mother's birthday.  Fresh lemon really adds the "zip" to this recipes.  I bought Lorna Doon cookies for the crust.  It was not difficult to make and the outcome is spectacular.  Very, very delicious. But it is sweet! It's a beautiful cheesecake/pie! Make sure you know how to test for doneness on a cheesecake and you leave a bit of "wiggle" in the center before taking it out.  Even if it splits the lemon curd will cover mistakes and so will the meringue.  EXCELLENT dessert!
2863	342	The cheesecake is delicious but I do not understand why both times I have made it I ended up with a pool of grease in the bottom of my oven. I crushed up shortbread cookies and added the melted butter as directed then pressed it into the bottom of the pan.  I thought it was a freak thing the first time. The second time it happened in a brand new oven. Next time I bake it on a cookie sheet.
2864	342	obviously i used the wrong brand curd.  next time will try homemade.  the final steps were a mess curd running down the sides and so on.  hopefully it will taste better than it looks!
2865	342	loved it!
2866	342	Doesn't look like the pic, looks a little droopy but tastes great.  I'll try agan.
2867	343	Took a few tries but when using the proper m/p, making sure the garlic is a paste, and SLOW with the olive oil. It’s terrific!
2868	343	Great recipe!  One of the few online recipes I've found for real garlic aioli.  Most of them are just garlic mayo.
2869	343	I needed this to create a hondashi Aioli for a recipe from a restaurant I couldn't get to when it was part of a daily special.  Still gathering parts to finalize my version. Here is the recipe idea Sweet chili-rubbed smoked pork belly, Japanese-style cabbage pancake, hondashi aioli, Okanomiyaki sauce, pickled onion, bonito flakes, chive!
2870	343	Use a garlic press to crush the garlic.Put the crushed garlic in the pestle and mortar and start grinding.Add the course salt.Whilst grinding:Add a teaspoon of lemon juice.Add the olive oil teaspoon by teaspoon.After about 5 or 6 teaspoons you can gradually add the olive oil a bit quicker.Done!Absolutely delicious.
2871	343	This stuff is *wonderful*!!!
2872	343	I decided to make this for the first time after getting a paella on the stove.  I had it made by the time the paella was cooked.  I was pretty surprised.  I used a milder extra virgin olive oil and the alioli had quite a strong bitter-sharp, green taste.  I didn't know whether it was the garlic and I needed more oil, or the oil and I needed to stop!  I stopped when the paella was cooked.  Once put on the dish it was fine.  The only difference between Chef John's and mine was that mine was more yellow in colour.  It wasn't particularly hard and didn't need any more mixing than in the video.  I was slopping the oil in at least a tsp or more at a time and it emulsified fine.  I used a marble m&p.  I'm going to have fun experimenting with different oils.
2873	343	I made it with the type of M&P Chef uses, and it was garlic soup no matter what I did. Then I used a fancy italian marble one with wooden pestle, and it came together easily, very thick. So the tool makes a difference. Williams Sonoma has them in stock where I live.
2874	343	Real aioli is really good. However, I have some tips from many failed attempts at getting this right so that any aspiring aioli artisans can learn from my mistakes.
2875	343	The recipe is perfect. The Aoli was delicious. I messed up by adding the oil too quickly, an error that will be corrected the next time I make this!
2876	344	Tart! I enjoyed baking them, but they were very crumbly, so I added more milk! Can't wait to make these again
2877	344	I added 2 more tablespoons lemon juice and 1 more of milk and they turned out perfect.  These are delicious!
2878	344	Very simple to make and absolutely delicious!!!  My new go to recipe.
2879	344	Added Crasin/nut mix -1/3 cup
2880	344	Was too dry  and crumbly. The dough wouldn’t hold together even before baking. I added more lemon juice than the recipe called for and I didn’t even taste it. Just tasted like butter and flour.
2881	344	I have always wanted to make scones but was scared for some reason. These are totally easy to make and they came out delicious! I used my blender/food processor to combine everything and the dough was perfect. I also cut the frosting in half and it was perfection.
2882	344	They are Amazing! Super easy. Light flaky. Followed directions. I just added tiny extra milk as needed to moisten the dough.Glaze just tart enough. Thank you for sharing.
2888	345	The bananas stuck to the parchment paper really bad, and did not come out a golden color like the picture shown. Taste is not great either.
2889	345	i made it , and the chips where crunchy, its just that i was dumb and didn't grease the paper. they stuck and i had to turn them to powder
2890	345	I made these and followed the instructions.  After 90 minutes I took them out to cool thinking they would firm up to be "chips", but they just stayed mushy.  Maybe I needed to bake them longer????
2891	345	Not good. They looked like shriveled mushrooms and smell weird.
2892	345	Yes
2893	345	Recipe was terrible!!!! I started baking at 12:30 and their not done at 3:45 the ones that I cut paper thin aren’t crunchy at all. The middles of the slices are black.
2894	346	It was quite good.   I added minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  When I took the chicken out, I added 2 Tbs of flour to the leftover butter in the pan.  Cooked it and then added about 1 c of chicken stock to make a gravy.  Poured the gravy over the chicken and some mashed potatoes. Served with broccoli.
2895	346	Really loved this recipe chicken was moist and tender my husband and i really enjoyed it
2896	346	Loved it!
2897	346	"Chicken breast halves" is too vague. My pound of chicken breast, that I cut in half, reached a steady state of 90 degrees on medium high heat and never went higher. I had to oven roast it for another 25 minutes at 400 to barely get it to 165 degrees. The chicken was a bit burned on the outside from sitting the suggested time on the skillet, so whatever interesting flavors were supposed to be there didn't survive browning.
2898	346	Loved it!  Easy to make and usually have all ingredients.  Simple and Delicious!
3009	358	Delicious.  Easy to make. Everyone loved it.  Made from ingredients I had on hand.
2902	346	This was good due a quick meal using chicken. I did add some fresh parsley, rosemary and minced garlic when I added the garlic powder. To me this gave the dish a little more flavor while still being super easy to make!
2903	347	easy to make and great taste. I added more chicken broth to ensure the breasts didn't dry out.
2904	347	Similar to what others have said, this dish had little flavor.  Based on the video, I added the wine, onion powder, garlic powder and paprika along with the other items the recipe called for.  The flavors were missing and I won't be making this again.
2905	347	I did make a few changes like used chicken broth instead of water and the bouillion (2 cups). Cooked the breasts whole instead of half and more garlic and lemon juice and I broiled them after with parmeasean cheese and thickened the sauce. The most moist delicious chicken ever. Melted in our mouths. Whole family loved it.
2906	347	Easy and tasty!
2907	347	Totally disappointed. I made mine with bone in thighs and drumsticks, so one can only assume that it would be more moist and flavorful over using just chicken breast. Not.  I even doubled the amount of lemon juice as I prefer sour over sweet. My taste buds were prepared for a lemony, herby, dish and they were sorely disappointed.
2908	347	I'm going to give this five stars on the smell alone! This is my first time making this recipe (I added a pinch of rosemary) and if it tastes as good as it smells, we have a winner!!!!
2909	347	Over all delicious meal.
2910	347	Excellent flavor. I added extra lemon and pepper for an incredible zesty flavor! Will become a go to easy chicken dinner.
2911	347	Very good, cut it with a fork & so easy to make. I didn't add the extra salt because I thought it would be too much, & I was right. I also added mushrooms in the last hr.  I will definatly make this again.
2912	348	Home grown pears are so sweet that I only needed 3-1/2 cups sugar and half the spices.  Recipe is pear-fecto.  Definitely a keeper.
2913	348	It taste delicious!  I had two bags of Sand pears from my son's tree. My husband and I peeled them all and I  ended up cutting up about 5 apples as well to add to the mix. I multiplied  each ingredient  × 6 except for the cloves and sugar. I  used about  3 teaspoons of ground cloves and 11 cups of sugar. It made 39 (1/2 pints). Mine has the texture and taste of applebutter. But it is really tasty!
2914	348	So horrendously sweet it is unusable.  I even cut back on the sugar because my gut told me it was too much.  I'm heartbroken about wasting some of the best pears I've ever had on it, in addition to an hour of my life.  I even like really sweet sweets ~ I'm not a no-sugar nut.  I suggest using 1/4 of the amount in the recipe.  I also eliminated all spices except for a dash of cinnamon.  If a fruit is really good, you don't need to drown it in camouflage.
2915	348	Super easy and delicious!
2916	348	Wow!!! First time making pear jam ever! Followed the recommendations from others to half the spices and add. full packet of sure gel... PERFECT! Tastes amazing!!
2917	348	This was a Christmas gift for my teacher friends! We are all teaching online and they need something sweet because this year has been sour!!
2918	348	This was my first time making jam, or canning anything, hoenstly. Per the other reviews, I halved the spices, but I added three jalapenos (seeds and membranes included) for some heat. It didn't firm up to regular jam consistency,  so maybe I should have used the whole packet of pectin. But, that said, it is suuuuuuper delicious!
2919	348	The spices overpowered the pear taste in my opinion. Very sweet
2920	348	To much sugar cut in three  cut the spoce on half
2921	349	Love it
2922	349	Love it! Added more h2o tho. :)
2923	349	I used limes instead of lemons because, yeah, you've heard it before, that's what I had on hand. My husband and I absolutely loved it -- tart and fresh and delish. I strained the pulp from mine, but he thinks that's such a waste so he drinks it pulp and all. I've made it twice now and will do it again regularly. Thanks for the great idea!
2924	349	I did not make any changes. Great the way it taste.
2925	349	I loved it! But i did make it different instead of lemons I used limes and add more water and more sugar as necessary. I found it too  bitter with lemons.
2926	349	AMAZING!!!
2927	349	This is a great recipe.  I followed it exactly as written and my husband and I both  loved it.  So refreshing! And what a great way to kick lemonade up a notch.  Also a great way to use up the cucumbers from my husbands garden!  I can't wait to make this for friends and family.
2928	349	This took a decent amount of work to make. I used a pretty big cucumber and I couldn’t get any more liquid out of it than 1/3 cup which was half the amount it was supposed to make. So I didn’t have as much lemonade as I would’ve liked. If I had a juicer for the cucumber it would’ve helped. The final product was delicious and refreshing. Very tart and very sweet though, so I’d suggest adding 1/4-1/2 cup of water at the end to dilute the flavor.
2929	349	I like the flavor of the cucumber with the lemon, but I felt there was too much lemon.  It almost immediately gave me heartburn from the acid.  I did use bottled lemon juice (1-1/2 cups, per recommendation of another user.)  Next time, I will reduce that to 1 cup and see if it is better.  I had to add more sugar this time to help with the sourness of the lemon, but I may not have to when I reduce the amount of lemon juice.  I had a large overgrown cucumber from the garden to use up.  I got about 3/4 cup juice from it, and put it all in.  Then I added the lemon juice and simple syrup - no need to cool down for a long time.  I put this all in a 2-qt pitcher, added about 1qt ice cubes and filled the rest with cold water, then stirred.  The ice melts and cools down the drink very fast, and the water to flavors ratio was good.  I have some mint and basil in the garden.  I am going to try placing some leaves in individual glasses of this to see how it tastes.
2930	350	I was about to give up on the air fryer.  This recipe was easy and tasty!  Thank you.  I have marked 5 other of your recommended recipes and I actually am looking forward to trying the air fryer again!
2931	350	I liked the end result, but I used cod, and I am a Halibut or Salmon snob. Cod doesn't do it for me. Next time I'll try salmon and cut them into chunks like a restaurant serves with fish and chips if you are lucky enough to find such a restaurant that serves it. I also will use Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. The result was good and I will try it again soon.
2932	350	I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  This gave the fillets a good crunch.  I also added approx 1/2 cup of parmesan, and salt and pepper to taste.  This was a VERY easy, VERY tasty dish!!
2933	350	Easy and delicious. May want to cook pieces longer than 12 minutes as some filets were not cooked all the way through. Cooked mine 17-20 minutes and they were perfect!
2935	350	Loved it! Used egg, Italian bread crumbs, olive oil, salt and pepper, on ocean perch. Cooked perfectly, will use this method forever! Crispy but tender coating, fish cooked exactly right. Thanks!
2936	350	This was great.  I didnt think of breaded fish in the air fryer.   I did add a bit of spicy creole seasoning I made inhouse.  Definitely would make this again.
2937	350	Love this easy quick and delicious recipe 👌👌👌
2938	350	Very crisp, moist - delish. Like others - added garlic powder, thyme and sweet Hungarian paprika. Will make again and again.
2939	351	I've tried more than 20 different versions of peach crisp/crumble recipes and this one is the only one that turns out the same every time: Canned or fresh peaches.  I upped the cinnamon by half a teaspoon.
2940	351	I used canned peaches. I ran the topping ingredients through the food processor.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of plain cinnamon.  I added just a tiny bit of salt. Turned out wonderful. Next time I will add a bit of spice to the peaches, maybe but no sugar. I don't like really sweet dessert s and this is one you can cut the sugar back a little and it still turns out amazing.
2941	351	the only change I made was I left out the salt.
2942	351	This was incredible and so easy. Also a great size for a small dinner party to share. Used 2 cans of peach pie filling (the lazy version of the peaches.) Highly recommend. Thank you Stephanie!
2943	351	It was pretty much as I expected-delicious! I used fresh peaches and only peeled 1/2 of them.  Pretty color.  I did add a little brown sugar and cinnamon to the peaches for extra flavor as one reviewer suggested.  I topped with whipped cream.  Next time I'll get vanilla ice cream.I will try again with other fruits, too.  Very easy.
2944	351	Super easy to make.  I ran the flour salt brown sugar butter and cinnamon through food processor then. Folded in oats
2945	351	This was really good. Not too sweet. Crunchy topping was buttery and delicious.
2946	351	No changes! Perfect the way it is!
2947	351	My lil family love it. And I sometimes add walnuts.
2948	352	We made these with a bottom crust and top crust (no crust on the sides), and they were delicious. I used my recipe for the crusts made out of butter.  We brushed both top and bottom crusts with butter. We also used extra butter in the filling.
2949	352	Did everything according to directions, turned out very soggy and the fruit wasn't even cooked all the way
2950	352	I followed some other suggestions - 1/2 lemon juice 1/2 vanilla / 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar - my entire house smells like a peach orchard - can’t wait to fully try it- with some vanilla ice cream on top…..
2951	352	Pre cook the bottom crust for about 10 min instead of egg wash
2952	352	Fantastic recipe. I omitted the nutmeg as I used the Land O Lakes apple pie crust recipe which has that in it. Used 2T cornstarch instead of the flour and added 1 t. vanilla. Put in a deep dish pie pan. I always put a handful of sugar on the bottom crust before adding the filling because my mom always did that. It took 55 minutes total to bake. My husband took it to work this morning and everyone raved about it. He told me "Write that recipe down".The secret to a great pie crust is to not overwork it. I use real butter cold and grate it into the dry mix, use a fork to incorporate, then add the cold water. This always turns out flaky and light.  It definitely beats store bought!
2953	352	This is the best peach pie recipe I’ve ever had! My family also approves.
2954	352	Made the recipe exactly, and was delicious.  My husband is picking, and he really likes it.  Thank you
2955	352	I used a 10” pie plate & increased the peaches to 6 cups.
2956	352	Great recipe, it's in the oven now and I'm sure that it will be a hit!
2957	353	Oh my god this was delicious. Made it with my students and it turned out so much better than I expected for something so simple
2958	353	Never made anything like this before, I’m not much of a cook but I just tried it and it’s amazing! My family is in shock!!
2959	353	It was quick and easy. Very tasty too!
2960	353	I do a pretty significant amount of baking, both from scratch and from boxes. This is a go to recipe for me when I need to make a quick and easy dessert to bring to a potluck. Everyone LOVES it! I am not sure what could have gone wrong in some of the other reviews. I have never had issues with this dish tasting like baking soda or being soggy. If you were to prepare the cake mix according to directions you will get an actual cake on top of your peaches, not a crumb type topping, which is closer to what this type of dish is going for.The only changes I make is that I like more peaches so I add a 3rd can, but I drain it so that it's not too soggy. And don't be afraid to switch up the flavor of cake mix! Spiced cake mix works particularly well! You can also sprinkle some chopped pecans or walnuts with a little bit of brown sugar on top of the mix before dabbing it all with the butter for a particularly flavorful crumb topping.
2961	353	One of my favorite go to desserts! It's delicious as is, but I usually add a sprinkling of brown sugar on top to give it just a small crunch.After reading through all the reviews, I will make one notation. I tried making this from memory a couple of times and once put in a casserole dish and found some of the same issues with powder taste. Also tried stirring it, didn't come out that well either. But, when I stick to the recipe it never fails.
2962	353	Absolutely love this recipe! I add more cinnamon than listed. It's my husband's favorite dessert. I don't understand the negative reviews.
2963	353	Tasted great and very easy to make . I added brown sugar to the top delicious.
2964	353	I made this last night with a few alterations based off of the suggestions in other reviews. I used three 15.25 oz cans of peaches, one in syrup, two in juice. I then sprinkled a decent amount of brown sugar on top of the peaches. I baked for 40 minutes, pulled it out of the oven and retamped the cake mix down. Then baked for another 25 minutes, checking it towards the end for color. The consistency was perfect.
2965	353	I didn't make any modifications and it turned out great! Biggest thing, I think, is to make sure to push the cake mix into the liquid. Takes like peach cobbler.  My GA boy loved it.
2966	354	I added vanilla that I made and a few drops of almond extract one can mangos and one can peach pie then sprinkled dried cherries. Delicious so easy to change up.
2967	354	Great to make if you need it the next morning also better in cast iron skillet in my opinion.
2968	354	I used all purpose flower but added baking powder 1tsp and 1/4tsp of salt. I also added a tsp of cinnamon. It turned out great
2969	354	Turned out great I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to mine. Really good
3132	373	This cake was absolutely delicious!!!! It is easy to make, and I used real fresh picked Ga peaches!!!
2970	354	Simple, easy, and absolutely DeeLicuoUs.   The only thing i did add was a  splash of pure vanilla extract,  which i added to my mixture of milk, flour and sugar.  ENJOY!
2971	354	This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious. I never thought living overseas  I would ever have this all time favorite American dessert. I added some cinnamon less butter and 3/4 sugar and it was superb. Thank you!!
2972	354	This recipe is really good.  We will make it again.
2973	354	First time making peach cobbler.  It was fairly easy. Taste is pretty. Family enjoys it. It's a keeper.  The only thing I didn't do was the extra juice from the canned peaches. It seemed to be too much juice. It takes very good.
2974	354	I added a little raw sugar to the mix and on top too. Plus U can use apple and mixed berry instead of peaches if U like. What ever fruit U like. For this type of dish anyways. Plus a little all spice nutmeg and cinnamon to the mix too.
2975	355	Was one of the best i have had yet.  I'm not big on smoothies but this one is one i can handle.
2976	355	Very versatile--I also throw in a hand full of fresh spinach.
2977	355	Made this for lunch today, we had a peach that needed to be used and all the other ingredients! Threw everything in the blender and it's delicious. I added a couple of scoops of vanilla flavored protein since we were having it as a meal replacement. Thank you for the excellent smoothie!
2978	355	I added a banana.  Liked it but will continue to try adding other fruits.  This was my first ever smoothie. I'm hooked. I'm sure I'll be making plenty more.
2979	355	Super easy, super yummy, super fruity! I used V8 Peach Mango juice and it is very healthy.
2980	355	This is the hard way to make a smoothie. We use frozen fruit right from the freezer. No need to add anything else.  You can get an amazing variety of single and mixed fruit. So delicious!
2981	355	Made it with the suggested fruits and the only change I made was to add vanilla yogurt instead of juice which made it creamy.
2982	355	Our first try EVER making smoothies and this was our first stop for a recipe. We had everything minus the mango juice,but it tasted a little  sour so we added honey to give it a boost of sweet, not much but some! Thanks for the recipe, we will be testing  W/ other fruits as well.
2983	355	Love smoothies. I used mango strawberry and Banana. Left out the juice though. and added some greek yogurt.
2984	356	This was easy especially if you buy the premade crust - the only thing left to do is just the filling and it's done.  It tasted so good.   :)
2985	356	It was awesome. Every one who got loved it!!!!!
2986	356	Don't like peach pie, said I wouldn't eat it. I made the recipe 😋  and I'm a Believer.Just one tweak. I use one cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown.  I fed it to everyone that would try my first attempt.  They've already asked me to make it for Thanksgiving.
2987	356	I did not add the orange juice…it smells and looks delicious!
2988	356	The crust is a little bit of work but worth it, I will use this crust again for other recipes. I have made this several times and everytime I make it for parties people ask for the recipe.    There is never leftovers!  The only change I made was increasing the cornstarch to 2T.  This is a good old fashioned cobbler like my grandmother from KY used to make.
2989	356	Couple of changes, like omitted the nutmeg because I don’t like it. Also omitted the thickening for the peaches because I prefer a juicy filling. Also used mango juice instead of orange juice. I like the homemade crust because that’s what my mother did. Brings back memories of her.
2990	356	great but should increase dough recipe. wasnt enough!
2991	356	Everybody enjoyed it.
2992	356	I love the recipe!!! I really use it for the crust and I don't use the orange juice. I also add more cinnamon, nutmeg I also add a touch of allspice. The crust is absolutely the best!! I add cinnamon to the dusting you put on top. Today will be my first time adding the melted butter to the top, I've made this several times never noticed that part
2993	357	This is a great recipe for a quick easy cobbler.  It came out very yummy and we served it warm with ice cream.  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and it was great.
2994	357	Very easy! Made a few adjustments. Used 1/2 the amount of sugar (brown instead of white). Used frozen peaches and cooked on stovetop first. To the peaches I added: brown sugar, nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbl cornstarch. Served with a scoop of ice cream. Yum!
2995	357	I made lots of changes out of the gate just from reading the original recipe and the first couple of reviews. I knew I would need to doctor up this recipe for it to be a hit for me. First recommendation is to cook the 🍑 peaches. I used two cans instead of 1, plus one can of water. Add the sugar, the water, nutmeg, and butter to a medium sauce pan. I cut the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Cook the peaches for about 20 minutes or until the peaches become tender.
2996	357	Loved it! Added more biquick and sugar on top. About 50 min. Bake time.
2997	357	made in my cast iron skillet. Melted my butter in skillet and then added bisquick and milk batter.  Very good.
2998	357	Incredible and easy !!!
2999	357	Really good! But I also made a couple changes ... a few tablespoons more of the Bisquick mix because batter seemed a bit watery, only used 1/2 cup sugar (1 cup seemed like A LOT), and added some leftover blueberries because ... why not?
3000	357	I doubled the recipe and only changed the nutmeg with half cinnamon. I also used fresh peaches instead of canned  I baked 53 minutes and really enjoyed the finished product.
3001	357	I love this recipe. It tasted great. I needed to drain more juice from canned peaches. Was a huge hit overall.
3002	358	No changes. I have made this several times; always a favorite.
3003	358	very easy as well as yummy!
3004	358	Where I'm from, we call this a "Dump Cake". Most commonly, I make it with crushed pineapples (from a can) and cherry pie filling. It usually only takes me like 45 minutes to bake. The key is to evenly distribute the butter over the raw cake mix powder. I don't even melt the butter, I just slice up a stick and put a dab every half inch, or so. It's so versatile and can be done with any fruit base.
3005	358	Noo changes I have made this cobbler several times in a Dutch Oven also.
3006	358	I followed the ingredients cooked it for the 50 minutes I used a can of peaches cake mix and the butter I pulled it out and it's very wet runny and big lumps and uncooked not good at all I was very embarrassed of it sorry but this really doesn't work unless you mix I believe the batter with the peach sauce
3007	358	I always made fun of the folks who say a dessert is too sweet.  Desserts are supposed to be sweet, right?  Well, this one is so sweet even a dessert-lover like me couldn't eat it.  Never, ever again.
3010	358	I made this with blueberry pie filling.instead of just pouring the butter on top of dry cake mix, i combined them to make a crumble topping.worked out beautifully.
3011	359	I have made this several times, and it always gets a 5 star rating from my family.  It is easy and delicious without any modifications.
3012	359	I made it just like the recipe but I used canned pears. Also if you have a convection oven or plain ole toaster over then drop the temp by 25 degrees. I love convection ovens. They cook in half the time. Mine was ready at 25 minutes but I let it alone for 30 just to get it extra crunchy and golden brown. It was really good and I think I will use just this recipe from here on out. Don't mind the missing corner. Quality control had to approve it. 😆
3013	359	It very easy for a first time try. It's so good you can fail.
3014	359	Great quick easy recipe. I added a teaspoon of corn starch as well, and I made it with seasoned apples instead of fruit. Very nice Apple cobbler with scoop of ice cream/whip cream.
3015	359	I made a blackberry cobbler a couple of nights ago and it was delicious.  I used this recipe as a framework, not following it exactly.  I used two 6 oz. packages of berries.  I mixed about 1/3 cup of the sugar in with the berries and let them sit for a half hour or so.  I used Bisquick instead of the flour and left out the baking powder and salt.  I used another 1/3 cup of sugar in the batter.  I browned the butter a bit first.  I have read quite a number of cobbler recipes and it seems about half call for the fruit to go in first and half call for the batter first.  I had made a blueberry cobbler the week before with the berries on top so decided to switch it up for this cobbler.  I really could not see any difference as it was going into the oven.  I cooked it for about 45 minutes and then put some sanding sugar on top for the last 10 minutes.  It was delicious.  Thanks for sharing such an EZ and tasty recipe!
3016	359	My husband LOVED THIS (as did I) - I did add about 1/2 c more fruit - used peaches, apricots cut to 1" pieces and blueberries. As always when I use fresh fruit in a recipe, I toss gently with a little bit of flour or cornstarch to no only thicken, but prevent the fruit from all sinking to the bottom. I thought the 55-60 cook time sounded long ang was proved right - mine only took 35-40 minutes. I can't wait to try this with other fruits I have on hand, as well as with apples in the fall. Oh, and a must have with vanilla ice cream for us - Thank you!
3017	359	Spot on!
3018	359	Great made with ground cherries sprinkled with cinnamon
3019	359	I had never tasted a fruit cobbler before this one, but it was a good first experience. I followed the recipe exactly and used both blackberries and raspberries for mine. There were many in my family who had had cobbler before and they said it was delish. It was mushy, but not in a bad way. It was not super sweet, but not NOT sweet: it was just right with the sugar. My crust got a little too crispy in some areas, but otherwise it was a very satisfying desert.It was also super easy to make. I thought cobblers would be more complicated, like a pie, and was relieved to find I was wrong.This fruit cobbler is a delicious and easy to make dessert that I highly recommend for any bakers, beginner or otherwise.Edit: I have made this with gluten free all purpose flour and oat milk for a fairy and gluten free desert. This cobbler never dissapoints!!
3020	360	Delish, only I did not use pectin... only peaches and sugar with a dash of almond flavoring. Popped it right into the fridge and use as jam and ice cream topping.
3021	360	I loved and I also left pieces of peaches in mine. So good...
3022	360	💗I'm very pleased with the results I got using this recipe for my first ever, homemade peach preserves! I used 12 gorgeous, Georgia cling peaches, (purchased from The Peach Truck Tour, which came to Michigan, where I picked them up) that were just ripe, and came out to exactly 6 cups and one teaspoon (for a sample taste!😋) of peaches, to work with. I did cut the sugar down to roughly half of what the recipe called for, so about 2 to 2-1/4 cups, as my family prefers a slightly tangier-sweet flavor, and after reading some reviews, I thought it might be just a bit too sweet with 4-1/2 cups sugar added. I also had a box of pectin that was only 1.75 ounces, but it did fine. I LOVE the flavor and consistency of these preserves! SOME of the 8 jars I made, will be gifted.(Do I hafta share!?😁)
3023	360	Only used 2 cups of sugar and sweeten to taste.
3024	360	I followed the recipe just to see what the results would be. Great taste! Perfect fruit chunks. But pectin should have been added before the sugar.  It's thick, but pourable. Please correct the recipe.
3025	360	Fantastic! first time making peach preserves and people are asking for my recipe~~
3026	360	Delicious
3027	360	So simple,no peeling!! And it’s not just  the simplicity I like it’s that it’s also delicious…already on 2nd bottle.
3028	360	I would love to make this recipe but would like the correction of how much water to add.  Its not on here.
3029	361	Quick, creamy, easy and so delicious! I will probably add more peaches and more vanilla next time! And there will be a next time!
3030	361	Awesome recipe!  Simple and delicious tasting!
3031	361	Not a creamy ice cream, but more of an ice milk. It has the texture of a Wendy's Frosty. Also, despite using fresh, extremely ripe and sweet peaches, it lacked peach flavor.
3032	361	Delicious!!!  But in the interest of reducing down to 1 quart, I did modify.  I used 3 ripe peaches, 1 small can evaporated milk, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, a dash of salt, 1.5 cups lactose-free half-and-half, about 1/2 teaspoon of peach extract/flavoring, 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and about 1 cup of sugar (eyeballing and tasting till right).  This fit into my Cuisinart ice cream maker, with still about 2 cups remaining, which I will process later.  Rave reviews!
3033	361	Followed the recipe exactly as written. Best ice cream we have ever had! Will be making this again.
3034	361	This is the best peach ice cream I've  ever made!! All of my family loved it! I made the recipe as written except I did not have whole milk so I used what was left of my half and half. ( I had a large carton.) And finished with 2% milk. It was delicious! Also, I did use one cup of sugar.
3035	361	Really easy and good. May as well make the 32 servings since it cost prohibitive otherwise. Share the extra!
3036	361	I made this recipe two different times. Both times I just cut the peaches into chunks instead or pureeing them well, and I think that worked fine. The second time I added less half and half and omitted the milk because the first time I made it the ice cream had overflowed. I also added cinnamon and vanilla for more flavor. It tasted good both times!
3037	361	I think this could use more peaches. I used 2 big cans of peaches and I think I would use 3 or 4 cans next time. Mine also turned out pretty icy. Good flavor though, I’d just makes some tweaks next time.
3038	362	Terrible,  not the right consistency, it was a bread like texture, def need more peaches. Bottom line it was so embarrassing that I made this dessert to bring to someone's house and it was not good at all. And I had to cook it like an extra 20-30 min or it would have been complete mush
3039	362	I am 51 years old.  Although I grew up in New Orleans, my grandparents were from the country in Mississippi.  My grandmother and mother have been making this exact recipe my entire life.  I acquired the recipe when I moved out as as adult.  We cook it at 375 for 35-40 minutes.
3040	362	This is a delicious desert that was greatly enjoyed by family, new neighbors, and new Momma and Daddy.  There are a couple modifications that were required.  It took longer and a hotteroven is needed.  I set to 400 degrees on convection and baked for 40 minutes to achieve a lovely appearing golden crust.I used 1/2 the liquid from the peaches and to the liquid I stirred in cinnamon to our taste (about 2 tsp).Each time I gift a cooked dish to someone, I include the recipe and recommend  Allrecipes  as well.
3041	362	i followed exactly as the recipe stated, but the crust was not firm looking or that of cobber. Looked not done.  I cooked it additional 20 minutes, the consistency just did not seem right for a cobbler. :(
3042	362	Love this recipe! My fiancé loved it too. (And she’s picky)  I did add 1 tsp of ground cinnamon. Very good!
3043	362	Love the recipe. So easy to make and tastes yummy!
3044	362	The only thing I had to change about this recipe is that I had to cook it for a little over an hour. It is really really delicious. Mixing the butter and sugar makes a terrible mess, but the end result is worth it.
3045	362	Quick, easy & delicious!   It cooked perfectly & the whole family loved it!   Will definitely use this recipe every time I make.
3046	362	I followed the recipe, knowing it was lacking in flavor so I added 1 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon and bit of Nutmeg, and upped the baking time to 1 Hr. Turned out delicious. Let cool for 15 minutes add Ice Cream and you have a winner.
3047	363	followed the author's suggestion to do as a loaf of quickbread instead of muffins, and incorporated changes from a few commenters:halved recipe to yield 1 loaf-used 1/2tsp each baking soda & baking powder-used 1tsp cinnamon-used 2 full eggs and 1/2c oil-added 1/2tsp vanilla-used 1c frozen & thawed diced fresh (that is, not canned) peaches-greased & sugared loaf panbaked 45min in a 380* convection ovenresults: came out well, with a nice crisp crust and moist inside that held together beautifully. would prefer a little more flavor in the bread itself, so would increase cinnamon next time (after decreasing it this time per comments; maybe just restore recipe proportion) and possibly add other spices (ginger? nutmeg?)
3048	363	These muffins had the perfect texture and just enough sweetness for coffee.  I only had canned peaches so I used them and cut the sugar to 1 cup white and about 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I didn't measure the cinnamon so it was prob a little more than a tsp.  The baking time was off for my oven so next time I will set it for 18 min and check to see if they need mre time.  Thanks for the recipe.
3049	363	BEST MUFFINS EVER!!!
3050	363	I used hand picked white peaches and very coarse salt and I definitely recommend it the only thing I would have changed would be I would use the sugar to make a compote with the peaches before folding them in just to Amp up the cobbler vibe.
3051	363	I made these today and I keep looking at the recipe to see what I missed. My batter was very dense, and I thought about adding some liquid, but then thought the moistness from the fresh peaches might fix it. But no - definitely need to follow other reviewers suggestions and add 1/2 cup milk. The flavor was good though. I only used 2 tsp of cinnamon (I can't imagine 1 tbsp), and also added some vanilla and almond extract.
3052	363	Too heavy and sweet.  Won’t try again
3053	363	Delicious! I used canned peach chunks and added the peach syrup and a little  cinnamon. They didn’t rise out of the pan very much but that was fine because  it made them a bit chewier around the edges. Will certainly be making them again. My husband said they were wonderful.
3054	363	i really enjoyed these delicious peach muffinseasy to make and delicious
3055	363	These are delicious! I made them gluten-free by using 3 cups of Cup for Cup  GF flour. The only other modification that I made was to sprinkle a mix of white sugar and ground cardamom on the top before baking.These are the best gluten-free muffins I've made in the 5 years since being diagnosed with celiac disease.
3056	364	Recipe is so easy to follow and delicious , appreciated the also easy print out . " Thank you ".
3057	364	I don't know what I did wrong, but I don't think anything. I followed the recipe exactly, but it ended up all watery
3058	364	It was restaurant worthy and so amazingly easy.I cut recipe in half, using one crust and one pack of  frozen peaches. I also halved the sugar to 1/4 cup. I didn’t even need that much.I ate the whole thing myself!
3059	364	Followed the recipe to the T. Turned out perfectly! So delicious!
3060	364	I am not a cook. I have never made a pie before today. But I got an invite to come for dinner today. It's a big deal because it's the first non-vague "let's do lunch" invite in a very small rural town where I'm a total outsider. I just so happened to have everything on hand and wanted to showcase the last of my Fredericksburg freestone peaches I'd frozen last week. I was thrilled to find this recipe online. I tasted the filling prior to pouring into the pie crust. I had some beautiful gold finishing sugar left over from Christmas cookies that made it look so "finished". Of course, I used twice as much as called for, but that's just me. Fingers crossed it'll be set enough. Either way, I'm happy and it's good to try something new, especially when it's this easy.
3061	364	I'm not a baker and this was so easy, and it is delicious!
3062	364	Delicious!
3063	364	This was a perfect way to use some of the peeled, sliced peaches I froze from the summer.  I did let them start to defrost while the dough was chilling (made the Gluten Free Pie Crust by Sandra LeRose on this site).  I used half the sugar and it was still delicious! Also used tapioca starch instead of corn. Thank you Bibi!
3064	364	This peach pie recipe was easy & delicious.  Although I made it as a rustic tart, (I used the 2nd pie crust earlier in the week on a chicken pot pie) the only other change that I made was that I used a 10oz bag of frozen freestone peaches; and I would make sure that I thaw them, when I make it again; as the peaches were still a little “al dente “ when the crust was done.  Otherwise a perfect peach dessert! ( the pie was so wonderful smelling while cooking that we ate it straight from the oven & I forgot to get an after photo!
3065	365	Best peach pie ever.
3133	373	Made this just to try the recipe and it was fabulous within any changes to the recipe. The cake was gone in a day because everyone loved it.
3066	365	At the beginning of preparing this recipe was a little skeptical. Had to try it. Followed the recipe to a T with the advice of other reviews to precook the crust. This I did however I backed off to only 7 minutes. This allowed the peaches to still mix in with the crust. I used a 10" spring form pan as from another reviewer stated. It turned out amazing.Thanks for this recipe. Will definitely be making again.
3067	365	I obviously did something wrong.  My crust was certainly not pourable.  I used gluten free all purpose flour and maybe that's what made the difference.  It's an ok pie now, but nothing to rave about.
3068	365	this was so good. My whole family loved it. I’ve already made it twice within one week and I’m making it again for Thanksgiving. Thank you so much so good.
3069	365	I have been making this recipe for years.  It's always a hit and is often requested.  The only change I make is using French Vanilla rather than plain vanilla pudding.  I prefer to serve it fresh from the oven or room temperature.   Great with peach or vanilla ice cream.  One year I did have to double the ingredients and use a 9x12 baking pan for a larger crowd.
3070	365	Won dessert contest at work party. Love this pie any suggestions on how to make Ina sheet pan there just wasn't enough.
3071	365	I have made this pie too many times to count especially when peaches are nice and ripe. And that is the only thing I have changed and some extra sugar for fresh peaches and there is NO ONE that doesn’t LOVE this pie and asks for me to bring it for our Fall parties .Thank You for having a delicious recipe !
3072	365	I like to use more cinnamon than called for once over the peaches.
3073	365	I made this just like the recipe called and it was perfect.  It is soooooo good. I will be making this again. If you love the flavor and texture of cheesecake, this is for you. Wonderful
3074	366	Easy and delicious!
3075	366	Outstanding taste and simplicity.  You might want to change the wording in step one regarding the halving and slicing of the peaches.  While this wording probably works fine for freestone peaches, earlier varieties of cling or cling stone peaches require a little bit different technique.
3076	366	Would add more peaches next time
3077	366	delicious & easy
3078	366	So so easy! The hardest part was waiting for it to cool in the fridge. I separated a small part of the peaches & cream into a ramekin and put it into the fridge so I could test it early. I left the rest to chill overnight. :)
3079	367	Was easy to follow,  and results looks great. Just made this afternoon  with fresh jaemor farms peaches. I 'll let you know, be surprised  if they not. Thanks for recipe. Sherry
3080	367	Simple,fast and......delicious.Brings back memories,my mother(RIH)would be shocked(lol)and happy.Thank you AllRecipes for making this easy,delicious and fun.Now,I will pass down to my grandbabies.
3081	367	My friend Janie and I were a bit sceptical, but gave it try anyway.  And are we glad we did!  These peaches are delicious!!!  The only thing we changed is we used Splenda instead of sugar.
3082	367	I was looking for a recipe for my father. He loves pi kled peaches but they are way to expensive in the stores. I ran across this one and made 4 pints. I took 2 to my father and he ate 1 pint right then and there and drank the juice! Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe.
3083	367	These taste just like I used to have when I was a kid.  Love them.
3084	367	Great Southern recipe not only for peaches  (like my Mom used to make) - I used mangoes. Delicious!
3085	367	Oh my word!  I've always waited to find these in the grocery store around Thanksgiving.  I had looked online for ideas after buying a large batch of fresh peaches and found this recipe.  They are so good!  I am going to buy additional fresh peaches and make a large batch so I can have them when I want!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.
3086	367	Instead of putting the peaches in whole, I chopped them up. This truly is the best Summer snack.
3087	367	These are wonderful and very easy to make.
3088	368	I put it in a 11x8 pan with 12oz of blueberries & 2 cups of peaches.  I increased the amount of flour & sugar to 1/3 cup of each.  I should have put more sugar in there.  It came out fine but it was hardly sweet.
3089	368	I doubled the topping because I wanted this to double as a dessert and baked oatmeal breakfast.  It worked out perfectly!  I would have never thought to put blueberries and peaches together.  I loved it!  I substituted the brown sugar with Swerve brown sugar substitute.  I substituted the butter with vegan butter and it turned out great!
3090	368	Absolutely the best! I used fresh fruit and added doble the lemon juice and came out excellent!
3091	368	I really like this recipe, it’s easy and delicious. I made a few minor changes, I used fresh peaches and blueberries, I swapped out the almonds for walnuts and I didn’t have nutmeg, but I had pumpkin spice so I used that instead. With a scoop of vanilla ice cream this is the best summer dessert!
3092	368	Love this exactly as written.  One time I doubled the topping as others suggested, but it was too much and overwhelmed the wonderful fruit, so now I increase it by only about 40-50%.
3093	368	The blueberries and the peaches definitely play off of each other to make a really tasty filling.  I did double the topping for the recipe based on the recommendations of the other reviewers, but it felt like a lot.  Unless you're really into the topping flavors, the recipe as written would likely be just fine.
3094	368	I cooked it for another 5 minutes.
3095	368	I used fresh peaches, but frozen blueberries.  It turned out delicious, but needed more than 30 minutes in the oven to fully cook.
3096	368	I use cornstarch not flour with the fruit and I add a teaspoon of vanilla to the fruit.  Without almonds it is good. I think I am going to try walnuts and / or pecans instead of almonds eventually.  The recipe is a real winner.  I have made this with blueberries, apples and rhubarb and apples only.
3097	369	Perfect in a pinch. I added a couple dashes of cinnamon, a splash of Meyers dark rum, served w/ a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a drizzle of room temp caramel sauce. I did't measure any of my add ins, sorry! I have faith you guys can  sort the details. 😉
3098	369	I've had this thing in the oven for an hour and a half of, and it's still not brown. Not sure what to do now.
3099	369	2.21.22 I actually scaled this down to 4 servings and am quite happy with the way it turned out.  Baked for 1 hour, the consistency is good, and tit’s not overly sweet.  Fresh peaches are selling for a minimum of $2.99 lb right now, so using canned peaches is a smart option if you have a good recipe.   The only thing I didn’t like were the pecans, but that’s easy enough to resolve…I’lll just leave them off in the future.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.
3100	369	Too much peach syrup - crumble/topping drowned in the juice causing it to be really soggy/doughy. Suggest using juice from just one can - maybe add a bit from second can - enough to half-cover peaches. Otherwise, it was tasty and very easy to throw together.
3101	163	Sometimes you just need something fast. I made it twice, once with canned peaches and once with frozen berries. Also, I used Splenda, instead of sugar.Cooked about 6 minutes longer with the berries to assure the batter was completely done.Great with ice cream or with whipped cream.
3102	163	I did a 1.5 recipe so it'd fit in a 13x9 pan. I used 2c of strawberries and 1c blackberries. Made as directed except I sprinkled a little sugar on the berries since they were fresh. It came out beautifully and was festive for the 4th of July! It was quick and easy too.
3103	163	Fabulous with peaches and also blueberries!!
3104	163	Easy one for vacation- put all dry ingredients in a bag, then just had to add fruit, milk (and added 1tsp vanilla like others suggested) and butter to the pan. I accidentally mixed the blueberries right into the batter, and it turned out fine. Everyone liked it and it took no time.
3105	163	Gianna why rate it when you didn’t even follow the recipe. Do the recipe and rate it….. then you could make a comment that you tried it with with tlue berries and wouldn’t suggest it. Or add your own recipe and give it s3.  That rating was unfair to the writer/cook
3106	163	Made it by using canned cherries and adding a touch of vanilla to the batter. I mixed all ingredients into the melted butter to save a bowl, and  also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top. Yum.  Reminds me of Mom’s cherry cobbler.
3107	163	So delicious! can’t wait to make it again!
3108	163	8.10.20  Got a little chewy around the edges, but that’s OK, this still was very good.  Recipe didn’t say whether or not to peel the peaches, so I didn’t.  I had some peaches to use up, threw in a few strawberries, and this was a totally simple recipe to make, almost like a dump cake.  I also think canned peaches would work well in this, as we head out of  peach season.
3109	163	This is just like my mother's peach cobbler recipe from the 1960s. It's perfect without a single change and everybody loves it.  My mother's recipe calls for 3/4 cup flour rather than 1 cup, but otherwise is identical.  I've made it with fresh peaches, fresh blueberries and canned peaches, and all are equally delicious.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream is almost essential!
3110	371	Easy & Delicious…
3111	371	Great recipe! Just added extra cornstarch for thickness.
3112	371	Love it, will make again.
3113	371	If I could rate this a negative 5, I would.  I am dumbfounded by how this got rated anywhere near acceptable by bakers.  First,  he top crust, which I spent a lot of time making from scratch, was totally unncessary and was pale and undercooked due to the directions instructions to cover it with aluminum foil.  I had tito uncover it an bake another 20 minutes to get it crisp.  Then it was dull and pasty looking because there was no brushing of egg white or milk to spruce it up.  I ended up removing the entire top crust and not using it.  What I was then left with was spiced, canned peaches with globs of soggy dough mixed in.  Disgusting.  I would have taken the spiced peaches, put them in a round cassarole and topped them with a butter, oat and walnut topping and made it a true peach cobbler.
3114	371	so good and will make again!
3115	371	can someone please tell me what temperature to bake the cobbler  it doesn't say in the recipe and, there's nothing about it in the comments.
3116	371	Really good! My brother said it was his favorite peach cobbler of all time. I may need to cook for a little longer though. My pie crusts were a little doughy. This recipe is not too sweet too, so it's perfect.
3117	371	We love it! Will definitely make again
3118	371	Nice and simple.  My kind of cooking. ITaste great.
3119	372	This peach cobbler was amazing! My son & I have to watch our sugar so I used a sugar free cake mix & no sugar added peaches in a can.( I didn't have fresh on hand.) I also decided to add no sugar added pears. I didn't have the big cans of fruit, so I used 2 cans of 0 sugar peaches & 0 sugar pears.  When it came to using cream cheese, I only had the whipped kind in the tub. I used half of the tub. I did follow the directions by putting dollop on top of the cake mix & it did just fine. I also added a half of nutmeg with the cinnamon.This was so good! I will definitely be using this recipe for holidays. Thank you for sharing your recipe🍰
3120	372	Very easy to make! Everyone loved it!!
3121	372	I just used the can peaches with juice and was enough and make small pieces of cream cheese and then melted butter. I did spray my glass pan with coconut spray. I am watching it cook now. Looks yummy.
3122	372	I made this using the tips offered in the reviews. It was very tasty and my family loved it! I cut the cream cheese into the cake mix, used the juice from the canned peaches, and melted the butter. It was quick, easy, and yummy! I will be making this again.
3123	372	This turned out great. My cans were 29 oz so I added another small can. The cake mix cream cheese and butter came out like frosting but it cooked perfectly. Thanks for the recipe
3124	372	Was yummy. Especially the bites that had the cream cheese. However, next time I’ll make it without the sugar. Cake mix has plenty of sugar already. I used fresh peaches so if you use canned that have sugar you might want to consider eliminating the sugar as well.
3125	372	Came out really great
3126	372	No, I did it exactly how it says to do it. Is awesome!
3127	372	Very disappointed, I had to cook it an extra 10 minutes just to get a golden and it still doesn’t taste like it should. Parts of the cake didn’t blend in and cook.
3128	373	Great recipe! I use fresh peaches. I made a glaze. 1 cup of powdered sugar; 2 Tablespoons of water; 1/8 teaspoon of LorAnn Peach extract. Whisk and put in sandwich bag, cut small amount from corner and the drizzle.
3129	373	Made this today only in mini pans.  Here are my changes for next time:  1 1/2 chopped peaches and small container of Yoplait peach yogurt.   With these changes my cakes should be a little lighter.  I was able to make them in 6 mini loaf pans and will only use 1/8 cup of flour for the peaches.  I topped my loaves with sparkling sugar before baking.  Next time I will coat the pans with sugar after I spray them with cooking spray.  I now call mine CO (Colorado) peach pound cakes.  This is the season for our very delicious Palisade peaches.
3130	373	Very moist and just right peachy.Cooked 70 minutes. Used all stated ingredients and fresh O’Henry Peaches cut in small cubes.
3131	373	Baked for one hour thirty minutes and it was still not done, in texture or taste. It did come out of the Bundt pan easily. As someone else suggested I cut into slices and toasted in the oven. The taste is good but I have another peach pound cake that is 100% foolproof and taste delicious.
3134	373	I have made this quite a few times. I don't change anything in the recipe and I don't add a glaze, although I have served it with a dollop of whipped cream or a small scoop of ice cream. It is always a big hit and is my husband's favorite cake (he is a cake fiend, so that's saying something). It is a great dessert when you are having a crowd for dinner, but I often make it for the two of us because it is so good and keeps well. I have kept leftovers in my glass covered cake plate for as long as five days and it has stayed fresh.
3135	373	I get boxes and boxes of peaches given to me every year. This year as I was making THIS my favourite pound cake, I decided to put them in tiny pans for gifts. It made 5 perfect  cakes! And everyone loves it. So moist and freezes beautifully.  Thanks All Recipes!
3136	373	I would really love to give a big thank you to whoever posted this recipe- this is the easiest dang thing ever! Baking has become my pandemic therapy -  but I have never gotten anything that even remotely resembled the picture.  It’s a very moist cake but the big surprise here was the crispy crust.  I may have gone a little overboard draining the peaches.  I always try to follow the recipe exactly and I did here except I just threw in pecans because it just seemed sacrilegious not to.  I will be making this regularly!
3137	374	This was tasty and fun.  We used frozen fruit mix of mangos, pineapples, peaches and strawberries, and it turned out well.   We mixed it the evening before, but waited to add the Sprite until right before we served it.  In hindsight, we should have listened to the author and mixed it all together to rest overnight.  It was definitely better the 2nd day, with the flavors having had time to meld and the Sprite to blend.
3138	374	We made this to go with our Mexican themed dinner with friends.  It was a huge hit!  Since peaches weren't in season, we added raspberries, pears and strawberries.  It was tasty and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.
3139	374	I brought it to a family gathering and it was a huge hit!
3140	374	Love this and I get two treats out of it!
3141	374	I always run out and the dispenser is in the air while the last few guests are trying to get the last drop. It’s a big hit.
3142	374	I used 2 bottles of moscato, 1/2 cup of peach brandy, and 1/4 cup peach schnapps. It was a big hit!
3143	374	This recipe is amazing! Everyone LOVES it when I bring this sangria to the BBQ. First Sangria I ever made, super easy, I used Cavit Moscato wine, and it was perfect!
3144	374	This was delicious and loved by all. I made a couple changes. I used apricot brandy and Pinot Grigio.   It is a very versatile sangria and could be changed to your taste.
3145	374	This tastes like summer in your mouth! Especially great for an outdoor party! It was delicious. I didn’t use the full measure of peach schnapps based on other reviews. And just upped my fresh peaches. This was a big hit. Definitely a keeper.
3146	375	Very  simple recipe. I added an 1/8th of a teaspoon of Baking Powder, a little more sugar and a dash of corn starch. It was very delicious!!
3147	375	A few things I forgot in my review. It took 60 mins to get the golden I wanted, at 350. I might bump that up a bit. Also I think you can reduce the sugar to 2/3- 3/4 of a cup. It was super sweet. I saw peeps complaining about it being mushy. I think that's from not letting your casserole and butter get to temp. Just melting the butter isn't enough, you need it bubbling. That way the batter starts to cook and rise as soon as you put it in the casserole. Using glass is also the best way to go.I'm now making another cobbler from this recipe, with mixed frozen berries and fresh blueberries with the sweetening reduced and sugar replaced with Splenda.   👍
3148	375	My husband loved it. Simple easy to make
3149	375	Quick and easy. I added cinnamon and nutmeg with brown sugar sprinkled on the top. So delicious! I like the idea of not making a roll out dough. Great recipe.
3150	375	this cobbler is bussin bussin
3151	375	Oh so easy and delicious!
3152	375	I've tested this recipe and it has become our new favorite dessert.  I'm not a fan of peaches so I substituted with mangoes and it works very well.  It is quick and easy when you have a sweet tooth but not alot of time.
3153	375	I didn't eat any due to dieting, but ut was all gone by the next morning. They only thing I added was vanilla, sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, and butter to the peaches.
3154	375	This was easy to make had all the items on hand no special trips to store. It turned out great. I used toaster oven so as not to heat up kitchen did 375 for around 45 to 50mins. I like my topping very done so if you don't cook less or maybe the 350.
3155	376	Wonderful recipe for fresh peaches!  I used fresh, juicy ripe, just "plucked from the tree" Elberta peaches and mashed them with a pastry cutter as one reviewer suggested.   Cut back a bit on the amount of sugar as others suggested and heated the sugar, eggs, & cream mixture to 140F as well.  Got great reviews from friends and family.   Will definitely make again!
3156	376	This recipe makes the BEST ice cream.  I have used it for Peach and I have used it as a base for other kinds like Strawberry.  It comes out perfect every time.  Thank you so much for sharing!
3157	376	It was good.  After reading other reviews, I added one peeled chopped peach.  If I make it again, I would add two.  I might try using a half a cup less sugar and see how that turns out.
3158	376	When I made it, I used yellow and white fresh South Carolina peaches.
3159	376	Excellent flavor!  I’ve made this four times so far this summer and everyone loves it!  I use a Cuisinart Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker which is perfect for 10 servings. Enjoy!
3160	376	This recipe is fantastic.  The first batch I made was better than any ice cream you’d buy at the store.  Super easy to make.  Any fresh fruit will work—just use the amount in the recipe.  Pro tip:  If you want firm ice cream, make it a day early and put it in the freezer overnight.  I used a plastic storage container.
3161	376	perfect!  wonderfully smooth and delicious!    My family asks for this all summer long.
3162	376	Big winner. Needed to cut recipe in half due to the size of my ice cream maker. Second time I made it, the farm stand was out of peaches (and we were in charge of dessert with friends). Bought raspberries, purée and seeded them using a sieve. Worked great.
3163	376	I cut the sugar to 2 cups, used whipping cream and whole milk instead of half half because that is what I had. I also hated the sugar and eggs over a double boiler to 140 degrees. I just couldn't bring myself to use completely raw eggs. I am so glad I cut the sugar. It was perfect at 2 cups. The sugar is the only reason I took a star off. It would have been way to sweet with the sugarstated. My husband told me it was the best ice cream I've made. Absolutely delish. Just beware it makes a double batch for most ice cream makers. I will cut this in half next time!
3164	377	This is now my go-to recipe for any fruit cobbler. The crust reminds me of the topping of creme brulee.
3165	377	Cut the sugar in half ... it's plenty sweet and if you want it sweeter, that's what Ice Cream is for!Added 2 Tsp Cinnamon, 2 Tsp Nutmeg and 1 TBS Vanilla to the batter.Also made variants with different fruit combinations. All of them are yummy!- Peaches and Blueberries- Peaches and Raspberries- Peaches and Craisins (Cranberry Raisins)- Nectarines- Apples- Apples and Raisins
3166	377	I have made many peach cobblers but always with the same issue, "I wish it was a little crispier". I ran across this recipe and tried it last night. OMG, this is not only super delicious but has a nice crunch to the top.  The only things I changes was to use a mix of the peach juice with the milk, sprinkled a little cinnamon on the peaches and I did 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  I have read the comments and saw these recommendations so tried them as well.  This is A MUST and I will make this many many times.  I used canned peaches for this.
3167	377	It was amazing with peaches so now I’m trying this cobbler crust recipe with apples. Amazing!! I will be using this for all my fruit cobblers
3168	377	Really good Recipe came out really good and delicious, And the crust was perfect.
3169	377	I have made this 3-4 times now. I do use a slightly bigger oval baking dish but other than that only change is vanilla sugar on top. I also typically find a fairly large juicy lemon as I love the flavour combo.PS I keep a sealed jar full of sugar where I put my scraped out vanilla beans in with sugar and just top up as needed.
3170	377	I used 1/2  light brown sugar and half white in the mixture. I doubled the oatmeal and added some vanilla too. I used 1/2 canned, 1/2 fresh peaches.  Used a 9×13 pan as I made 1.5 x the recipe. Turned out good. But felt it could cook longer than 45 min. Probably 60 min would be good. Flavor yummy and the 15 more minutes would make it even more crispy.
3171	377	Loved the simplicity of the cobbler topping
3172	377	I loved the flavor of the lemon rind and the crispiness of the cobbler.
3173	378	So easy and delicious!
3174	378	Easy and delicious! Serve with vanilla ice cream for a quick dessert.
3175	378	Totally delicious! My 14-year-old made this easily & though he may have been heavy handed on the brown sugar & cinnamon, it’s super hard to mess this up. Absolutely wonderful!
3176	378	Very easy and tasty I would peel the peaches next time
3177	378	Followed the recipe to the letter. Excellent! Easy! Inexpensive! Best with super sweet peaches. Would be nice to add candied nuts or raspberry compote (or both!). Highly recommend!
3178	378	I bought large peaches and cut them in fours.  I also bought vanilla bean ice cream instead of traditional vanilla.
3179	378	We made it exactly as described, and it was delicious.  It was super quick and easy to cook while we ate, so it was just like having fresh from the oven peach cobbler without all the fuss and calories.
3180	378	It was soooo yummy! And the clean up was a breeze with the aluminum foil! Definitely doing this over and over again!
3181	378	This is so good.  But beware, these peaches are too hot to eat direct from oven, like burn your mouth hot. Next time I’ll be cooling them at least 15 to 30 minutes. Than the ice cream won’t melt immediately. Maybe I should have known this???
3182	379	used a bag of frozen peaches from whole foods. kept an eye on it and baked a bit longer to get browner, crispier edges. yummy!
3183	379	We used Palisade Peaches from Colorado that we can only get once a year. We will be making this every August when we have peaches from now on.
3184	379	I loved the cake portion of it as much as the fruit. I made 1/2 recipe and it worked well for me. I would add more blackberries next time.  Will definitely make this again!
3185	379	I stuck with the recipe except I used more peaches n blackberries
3186	379	My family just loved this recipe! They are still raving about it today.  I added a little cinnamon to the batter and it really worked. I love cinnamon and so adding a little extra just seemed like it would make it taste even better. I will definitely be making this again in the future.  Oh, I also served it warm with vanilla ice cream! So good!!!!
3187	379	Was very easy to make. Turned prefect! Great summertime recipe,
3188	379	Delicious! I remember a recipe very similar to this I made as a teenager which is why I chose this one. I did make a couple of substitutions based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used Bisquick instead of flour and I used 1/2 c heavy cream and 1/2 c 2% milk because I didn’t have whole milk. It tastes great, however, my batter came out a little too thin. That’s my fault due to the substitutions I made. I will for sure make this again as the recipe is written and hopefully my crust will turn out better. Overall, it’s a great recipe that’s simple to make and difficult to mess up, even if you don’t exactly follow the instructions as written.
3189	379	Great recipe, I cut down on the butter a bit though.  I use just enough to coat the pan.
3190	379	I made it and it was awesome my fiance loved it blueberry apricot
3191	380	I used to make this every year.  I always had a frozen peach pie in the freezer.  If I needed a quick dessert I would make a pie crust and sit it in a pie plate and I had a great dessert.  I would put aluminum foil in pan and add filling.  When frozen, wrap it up and use freezer paper as a final cover.  These are flat and stack great in freezer. If you have more than 1 size pie pan, mark the filling as to which one you froze it in.
3192	380	Sounds like a great idea to freeze and then bake but after doing this more than twice, I came to the conclusion that freezing the peaches puts way too much water in the filling. Never mind about serving warm as it will be too runny.
3193	380	It needs to bake longer  at 350 degrees than the recipe indicates.  Probably added another 20 minutes to the baking time.
3194	380	Looks and smells great. Followed the recipe, but increased the peaches to 4 large per pie dish. In the freezer they go...
3195	380	Fantastic & easy! I haven't baked a pie yet but can't wait till the winter and pull out the peach filling to make a pie.
3196	380	This is a great recipe. I made the mistake of using peaches that werent as ripe as they could have been so my filling was quite tart. Next time I'll be using fully ripened peaches!
3197	380	I placed the frozen peaches into my prepared 10 " pie crust. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes and then lowered temp to 375. Took a total of 2.5 hours to fully bake and cooked all over my oven. I won't be doing this ever again!
3198	380	I absolutely loved the peach filling! I made little peach pies using it, and instead of minute tapioca, I used  an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. I also added some cinnamon. I will without a doubt make this again.
3199	380	I made changes, in that we had a diabetic in the house!  It was served, telling the company that I had (10 people in all)!  We had two pies made with sucralose and anyone could have Yasso yogurt bars who didn’t want the pie!
3200	381	I tried this for the first time. I changed a few things, like used freshly squeezed orange juice. I only had can peaches that were no sugar added and used vanilla Greek yogurt. I will continue to use this recipe. I loved it.
3201	381	I loved it!
3202	381	Omitted the sugar. It wasn't needed. Made some with Sunny D and a quart of freshly frozen peaches. Added fresh strawberries to the last little bit for my oldest dtr. Used peach yogurt instead of regular. so good.
3203	381	Yummiest smoothie I've found friendly to Gastroparesis diet
3204	381	I added another 1/4 of orange juice and it was great
3205	381	WOW.  This was surprisingly, incredibly good!  I used 3 overripe fresh peaches (couldn't bear to throw them away), 1 banana, vanilla yogurt,  1/4 cup unsweetened vanilla almondmilk.  I had no orange juice, so I used 1 fresh orange (1/2 freshly-squeezed orange juice and 1/2 peeled orange). Did not add sugar. We thought it was plenty sweet enough.
3206	381	I realized that I'd finished off our OJ last night, so instead of OJ I used about 3/4 cup of Sunny D and only added 1 Tablespoon of sugar.  Also found we were out of vanilla greek yogurt so I just used a small container of greek peach yogurt.  All in all, it was delicious and I'll make it again!
3207	381	Such a fruity delight!
3208	381	very good NO NEED TO ADD SUGAR!!
3209	382	What a delight. I just made mere minutes ago and it turned out delicious. I added a glaze like the photo appears and the glaze makes all that much better. Oh I will definitely be making this again.
3210	382	Loved it but I made it with homemade peach preserves instead of fresh peaches.
3211	382	A little hard on top but really moist inside would make it again, good with scoop of ice cream
3212	382	So easy and good.  Changes: 11/4 sugar, 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, baked at 350 for 50 minutes.
3213	382	This cake is awesome. I used 3 cans of peaches and added about half a cup of the syrup from the peaches to the batter. I also sprinkled some sugar on top
3214	382	Because I can't  leave a good thing to itself... I made the following adjustments.  First step is to macerate the fresh peaches with 2 tbls sugar and 1 tbls fresh lemon juice with just a bit of lemon zest,  let that sit to create its juice while you prep the other ingredients.  Second,  blend 1 1/4 c white with 1/2 c light brown to add a bit more flavor. Third, I used 1 c unsalted butter instead of oil. Blend very well before adding the flour, salt, and soda. The dry and wet should be well mixed before adding the now juicy peaches until just blended.  That should sit for 5 minutes before putting into cake pan. Yum, can you smell it baking? The other cooks drizzle toppings are all good.
3215	382	This is really good and simple to make.  I did as recipe said, put it all in a bowl and mixed by hand with a wooden spoon  until blended.   I used fresh peaches. I forgot to set the timer on the oven and seriously overbaked it and it was still delicious and moist.    I served with whipped cream this time.   I made a topping to add as served as well from 1.5 cups powdered sugar and 1 cup pureed peach and a little vanilla, cooked on stove to boiling.    This is a good, fast and super easy cake to make.  I will make it my go to recipe over and over and experiment with different fruits.
3216	382	I made this recipe as is AND used a little over half of the recommended glaze on top:  1/2 cup evaporated milk (or 1/2 and 1/2) plus 1 stick butter plus 1 cup sugar plus 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.   YUM!!!!  SOOO moist— almost like bread pudding!  I agree with a few others to watch the time— mine only took 25 mins.  Thanks for the tip from a reviewer to put a cake pan with some water on the lower oven rack for increased moistness. Thanks for a wonderful recipe during peach season!!
3217	382	Tasted plain and more like my apple cake base. Needs more of a peach flavor.
3218	383	I thought this was delicious! Taking a cue from the other reviewers' suggestions: I added 1 1/2 tsps vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp almond extract, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the cake. I also used buttermilk in place of regular milk. There was no bland cake here! It was perfectly sweet, with a lovely texture, and it really allowed the fresh peaches to shine through. I also loves how quick it came together! I would definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!
3219	383	great recipe
3220	383	Since we love peaches and upside down cakes, thought I would give it a try.  Only one thing I changed was substituting milk for nondairy sweet cream. It made the cake fluffy and added flavor. It was a hit and will make again
3221	383	Nice recipe. Embellished the recipe a bit after reading reviews. Almond extract and cinnamon added to batter. Very tasty.
3222	383	I made a couple adjustments as per the comments, so only giving 4 stars.
3223	383	Oven temp way too hot. my oven runs a little hot, but this was crazy, dark brown on top in 25 minutes and when I flipped it, dough in the middle. I knew 25 minutes was not long enough, but any longer and the top would have been black. I would cook at 350, not 375.
3224	383	I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9x13 pan.  I added 1 cup pecans with the peaches.  I replaced 1/2 the milk with Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey.  It was delicious, moist, and not bland.   Enjoy!
3225	383	first of all, i only used 3 peaches - i don't know where I would have put the rest, the pan was full after 2!  The cake is really mellow and moist and the topping (bottom) is really good - I added a splash of vanilla but otherwise made it as written.  I'd make this again.  I bet it would work with other fruits too!
3226	383	I've made a peach upsidedown cake for more 50 years. I've used recipes from this website for various dishes to change things up and always successful. However this cake was very dense.  I then made another thinking I had messed up. I added an extra egg but not much better. Needless to say I was very disappointed and so was my family.  I'll go back to my old recipe.
3227	384	I found it was to runny and needed a lite extra flavor so I made a few changes to make it perfect.
3228	384	I made this pie and it came out great.  I changed it a little  I used less sugar and less butter added. Garam. Masala.
3229	384	This is an easy, DELICIOUS peach pie!  I made it exactly as the recipe stated. No adjustments, no substitutions! You don’t mess with perfection.
3230	384	Love this recipe!
3231	384	Great peach pie…the best I’ve ever made or tasted!
3270	388	Despite straining my peaches, the pie was still very 'soupy'. And as others have pointed out, upon sitting the topping absorbs juices to the point that it, too, is soggy. Good enough for 'just us', but I wouldn't serve it to guests.
3232	384	This was delicious! The whole family raved! I cut back the sugar by about 1/3 because I knew my peaches were very sweet on their own and I tend to reduce sugar in most recipes anyway. I also baked the pie for closer to an hour. 45 minutes just didn't seem like it was golden enough.  The recipe, as a whole, was amazingly simple. I love that!
3233	384	Will make some adjustments next time, although it is delicious. I could not get 10 cups of peaches into my 9" pie plate, so I ended up using 8 cups.  I stirred the flour/sugar mixture into the peaches before putting them into the shell, and then dotted with butter before lattice top went on.
3234	384	This pie was an absolute hit! My whole family loved it :) My husband especially, lol. Even my Chinese in laws, who don't much care for sweets, enjoyed it.
3235	384	Tastes just as good as it looks! I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.
3236	385	At first I had the want to dump all the peaches and juice in but I'm glad I read the reviews because when it says spoon the peaches in the batter that's exactly what you do so that it's not watery. Following the directly exactly the way it says makes an absolutely delicious peach cobbler. The best I've ever eaten. Kudos to the author. I won't make it any other way now. Thanks for sharing.
3237	385	it was the best peach cobbler ever
3238	385	I’ve made this so many times. I make it exactly how it is written. It is one of my go to desserts. It’s so delicious.
3239	385	After reading reviews saying it had too much liquid, I decided to drain the peaches  - just drained in the can so there was some juice remaining. I also reduced the water when mixing with cornstarch to maybe 1/4 cup. I followed all other directions but checked it after 45 mins and it was browned enough at that point. It turned out perfect and delicious. It really was the Best Peach Cobbler Ever! Perfect with a scoop of ice cream. Crunchy edges and gooey middle. Just perfect. Not too much liquid at all this way. Mix that cornstarch in well. And mix the batter well to prevent lumps.
3240	385	I've never made peach cobbler before,  it came out amazing.   I added more cinnamon, sugar,, and nutmeg on the top.  Phenomenal! I'll be making this again for sure. Maybe next time I'll make it with apples.   😊🍑💕🥧🎀
3241	385	Quick and delicious.
3242	385	I made this almost exactly as the recipe was written....only substitution was frozen peaches for canned.....sooo good!
3243	385	This was terrible. Inedible and mushy
3244	385	Excellent peach cobbler! Did not use all of juice from the peaches. Best ever!
3245	386	I made it with fresh peaches, omgMy husband and I couldn’t stop eating itWonderful. Perfect wouldn’t change a thing.
3246	386	Absolutely delicious!!  My family  couldn't  get enough!!!The only change I made was to use butter because we don't use margarine and self rising flour.  Remember to eliminate the baking powder/soda  if using self rising flour.This definitely is a keeper!!!!
3247	386	Enjoyed it! Instead of margarine, I used butter, it was good! Next time I think that I will add the butter to the dry ingredients before adding the milk.
3248	386	Was great, I added some nutmeg and a lot more cinnamon. Extra cinnamon on top and some in the batter.
3249	386	Made this today.  Used fresh unpealed peaches.  Because I like a crispy crust, I substituted butter for milk.  I baked it longer, about 45 mins. total.  came out pretty good.
3250	386	Nice base recipe, I did add extra cinnamon and nutmeg used 3  29oz cans of peaches 1 drained, the other 2 not, plus I replaced the liquid and used the remaining peach juice.
3251	386	Saved the juice from the peaches to add to the batter if needed. Added cinnamon and nutmeg to batter. Stirred peaches up in bowl with cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar before placing on top. Doubled the recipe-- had to cook for over an hour in order for it to set. Cover top with foil to keep from burning. Very good!
3252	386	Really easy and tasty. I will make again!
3253	386	Easy to make!  Waiting for it to cool a little
3254	387	This cobbler was made well. I put in keto sugar and keto cake mix. The peaches were full diet. The mix was well accepted by my church. First place for dessert.
3255	387	Amazing recipe for being stovetop! Going to make it again! I put more cinnamon and sugar on the batter after I layer it! More sugary goodness!!
3256	387	No, it was too dry and crumbly. The cake mix didn't absolve the juices.
3257	387	Haven't tasted it yet but it looks great so far
3258	387	I have made it several times and it turned out perfectly every time. I did not add any sugar to canned peaches but I added blueberries. Very tasty.
3259	387	This is my recipe from a LONG time ago! Thank you for the reviews. I suppose I should have been a little more explicit when I typed the recipe out. Use peaches in LIGHT syrup or natural juices or it will be TOO sweet! And I used Jiffy yellow cake mix. I'm not sure if it makes a difference or not, but I have Townscraft pots and pans. Those of you who are familiar will know that they work similar to a pressure cooker. Anyway, I think it's pretty darn good especially for the beginner! Thanks everyone!
3260	387	Make sure you use good peaches.  I used Target brand peaches, which were kind of bitter, and it ruined the recipe.  After switching to Dole or Libby's (I forget which) in heavy syrup, the recipe was great (although as with many other commenters, I left out the additional sugar).
3261	387	I was very skeptical of this recipe. It just seemed too easy and quick for peach cobbler. Not the case. This is an amazing throw down dessert that I will continue making for years to come. Thank y'all and enjoy.
3262	387	Easy and tasty :)
3263	388	Had Georgia peaches with skin already prepped with cinnamon and nutmeg. First time making this recipe. Used pre-made pie crust.  Pic is obviously pre-baked. On this hot Ohio day, in my upstairs apartment, I don’t have the time nor patience to wait and  post the  finished pie.  I don’t even have ice cream as of today. FJB.
3264	388	Easy to make and was delicious!
3265	388	It is quite sweet but, OH, so tasty.  Didn't last long which is always a good recommendation!
3266	388	This is my new "go to" recipe for peach pie. Simple, quick and delicious. I used 6 small peaches and could have used a couple of more had I had them.
3267	388	Added a bit more sugar because my peaches were not fully ripe. Turned out amazing!! Made a second one and sub’d in strawberries for 2 of the peaches. Wonderful.
3268	388	This is the best pie recipe I’ve found, so easy...so delicious.  I’m using apples next!
3269	388	Great tasting a quick pie.  I used thawed frozen peaches and fresh satsuma oranges mixed.  More peaches than oranges.
5364	680	We love this.  I add corn and we eat it with meat and when I cook Mexican we use it as dip.
3271	388	This is a new peach favorite.  Couple of changes along the way (of course !)  I added large pearl tapioca to peach slices as they were very juicy and fresh and I didn't want a soupy pie.  I also broiled it for 5 minutes (high) after baking for 345 minutes,  just for a wonderful brown , sugary glow.  PS:  Used Reynolds aluminum on pre-heated baking pan to make for easy cleanup.  This is a GREAT recipe!!
3272	389	Followed the recipe to the letter. Very possible that it was the worse Peach Cobbler I ever had in my life. So much breading, it was like biscuit's and peaches, but mostly biscuit's.
3273	389	Excellent-did not disappoint.  What I did:  Doubled entire filling recipe.    Used 1 heaping tsp. cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.
3274	389	I did sub. Salted butter for Shortening.  used a little more of flour ,cornstarch ,baking powder. As I used a very large  Casserole and 8 large Free Stone Peaches . Brushed top with Butter And  sprinkled with sugar. Yummmy
3275	389	Loved this!  Had been searching for a recipe that tasted like what my mother made when I was young. This is it!
3276	389	Doubled topping - hand shaped into "biscuits" -put 6 three inch rounds by half inch on top of peaches in 7" x 11" casserole and then took the leftover crumbs and mixed in cinnamon sugar and some brown sugar and sprinkled on the whole dish - a nice slightly crunchy and flavored topping to make it look good. I think I used about 7 fresh peaches (one Aldi's 32 oz bag full) sliced thinly and sauteed them in a stick of butter until tender ( a good 20 mins)- added lemon juice and lots of brown sugar and cinnamon sugar to taste - a pinch of salt too ( half teaspoon as the butter is salty too). Since my peaches were pre-cooked -I baked for 30 mins at 400 F .  I checked biscuit with a knife and turned it off while we did an errand and ate dinner. It was perfect an hour later.
3277	389	This was delicious and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and I would make this again it was so easy.
3278	389	This was delicious and easy to make. I doubled the recipe and I would make this again it was so easy.
3279	389	Will totally make it again.  It was very good!!
3280	389	Looked at the other suggestions and doubled the topping and added sugar and cinnamon on top.
3281	390	The first time I made it it was cake like and delicious and there preaches stayed intact.  The second time it was mushy. I really don't know what I did wrong the second time. But both tasted absolutely delicious!
3282	390	This came out pretty good. I tried to make a smaller batch than the recipe but I think my math was off. I could have used more peaches and a little more cake mix. Overall I liked it. Added a little cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste wide both were good adds. It was more peach crumble than peach pie but I prefer that. I would recommend this recipe
3283	390	I've never had much luck with dump cakes because the cake mix stays dry, but I needed something quick to take. I only wanted a small pan so I used an 8x8 and one can of peaches in fruit juice. Half a boxed cake mix is 1-2/3 cup so that on top of peaches. Then I GRATE my cold butter over all. Once the butter melts in the oven I lightly stir it around with a fork so the cake mix is evenly dampened. After it starts to bubble around the edges I break the top up with a fork (don't stir) so the juice bubbles all over and creates a yummy topping. You don't have to worry about the cake falling because it stays more like a crust so open your oven as often as you need to to prevent those powdery places! Tasted great! I didn't change the recipe, just the process a little.
3284	390	It was easy, but very thin so it didn't make as many servings. It is like a Cobbler.
3285	390	Was very easy, next time I going to try it with different fruit.  Used the french vanilla cake mix.  Was very sweet...
3286	390	I made this recipe with the suggested tweaks of using only half of the cake mix and melting the butter for better distribution.   It was SO sweet.  If you like really sweet things, you will probably like this recipe, but it was way too much for me.  One thought I had, though, is that it might be good as a topping on plain oatmeal.  I don't plan on making it again.
3287	390	This is not a cake. This is more of a “crisp” or “streusel”
3288	390	Tastes good but it came out mostly powdery on top.
3289	390	Followed the recipe and it looks so good. Gonna have later for dessert!!
3290	391	Very yummy 😊
3291	391	This recipe is a family favorite! Honestly, better than you can find at any restaurant! Normally, I tweak recipes to my own liking but this one is perfect as written! Ok, one small tweak I made was to double the rum in the sauce but that's just because I like a heavier rum flavor!
3292	391	Heaven! I’m the kind of person who rarely makes a recipe as written. I’m always looking for ways to infuse and enhance for more flavor and I typically do a thorough read of the reviews for inspiration on alterations. Number one, I used a whole loaf of crusty, 3 day old French bread. It ended up being a little over ten cups. I started with less than that, but it needed all of it to fully absorb the amount of liquid I ended up with since I used 3 fresh, very juicy peaches. Two of them were a little less soft and ripe, so I baked them for 15 min with a little brown sugar, butter, and a mixture of honey, maple syrup, and a dash of rum extract drizzled over. Instead of 1 1/4 cups of just water, I used the liquid from a can of fruit cocktail (just cuz it was what we had on hand) mixed with the liquid leftover from the baked peaches, and water for the remaining amount. I added one extra egg. I ended up with a perfect ratio of bread to custard and it perfectly filled a 9x13 pan. I ended up letting it sit and soak more in the fridge for about an hour while I prepared the rest of dinner. Baking for 1 hour at 325 was just right. Instead of rum in the sauce, I used half rum extract and half vanilla extract and the rummy flavor was just right for me. Served it with vanilla ice cream. One of the best desserts I’ve made, maybe ever. Dad said he was going to the store to buy more ingredients for me to make it again lol.
3293	391	AWESOME RECIPE! DEFENTLY I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.    THE CARMEL SAUCE IS  GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT ON ICE CREAM  OR WITH SLICED APPLES.  YUMMY!
3294	391	This turned out incredible. The family loved it. I will make this again. For the caramel sauce i substituted 2 tbs of Crown Royal Peach instead of the rum.
3295	391	I just finished the recipe the flavoring is delicious, however I added 1 additional cup of  water because the bread absorbed the egg batter leaving it dry. Otherwise my early thinking made it all worth it.
3296	391	So good!  We used 2t vanilla instead of rum (as stated in notes) and poured it over the top in the 9x13, turns out delicious every time.
3371	400	We thought it just tasted like sweet tea with little to no peach taste. I’m going to try making more syrup and add it. Our peaches are tasty too!!
3372	400	I tried twice and it was nothing like peach tea. It was really sweet tea, no peach flavor at all. Maybe recipe is wrong??
3297	391	This recipe was very good with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviews, which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The bread pudding itself was a decent base but definitely needed more peaches (I used 1 quart of home-canned but will use 2 next time) and at least 1 additional egg (I used 4, but will use 5 next time).  I also reserved the juice the peaches were in and used that instead of water.  I used 1 package of hot dog buns which turned out great as it used them up and I didn't want to go out and buy French bread.
3298	391	Inadvertently overcooked it, but still good.  I added an extra egg and  1 cup bread per other suggestions.  Next time may use canned or frozen peaches as I don't enjoy peeling fresh peaches!
3299	392	I used a balsamic reduction for this wonderful salad on a bed of baby wild greens for a lunch entree for 3 of us.  It was wonderful!
3300	392	Nice! Dinner party favorite! Made it for ten guests. Added a bit of fig glaze. Smashing hot!
3301	392	Peach & Tomato Caprese Salad by Julie Hubert. Didn't layer. Serve same day for pretty.
3302	392	8.7.20 ...  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/258123/peach-and-tomato-caprese-salad/ ... 'Didn't layer & no cheese, darn it; but still good & so pretty! It got good-tasting quickly & lost its beauty overnight. If making ahead, remove basil leaves & replace before serving.PEACH & TOMATO CAPRESE SALAD by Julie Hubert
3303	392	This recipe was delicious!  I am a huge fan of caprese salads but peach sounded sketchy as an addition.  It wasn’t at all.  My daughter snd her husband, both skeptics, each had seconds
3304	392	Such a refreshing summer salad with fresh peaches a mind fresh tomatoes.  I used Buratta mozzarellas cheese with truffles which gave it a country-club meal feel.
3305	392	Love, love, love this even better than regular caprese! The peach gives it a little sweet and a little juicy that complements all the flavors.
3306	392	Tried it once without dressing and thought it was missing something. I believe my peaches at Kroger were subpar and would like fresh peaches next time.
3307	392	I made it - used goats cheese instead of mozzarella - my tomatoes were not ripe enough
3308	393	I used regular brown sugar and thawed peaches, the hubby doesn't eat bread, so  no cobbler☹️. We only had walnuts,  so walnuts it is, I also threw in some granola. It's delicious and he gets to feel special with this dessert just for him. I kept watch and probably baked 45 minutes.
3309	393	I made enough for 8 people and they loved it.
3310	393	Delicious!
3311	393	Tasty!   Made it as directed...this is definitely a topping, not a self-contained dessert!
3312	393	I had not-so-good, rather mealy, fresh peaches on hand and thought I’d try this recipe. I didn’t have pecans so I used walnuts. Also it took about 35-40 minutes to get a syrupy consistency. Delicious over vanilla ice cream.
3313	393	An easy summer dessert to have prepped and in the fridge, awaiting a brief stint in the oven or bbq after the main meal is cooked. As per other reviewers, I used fresh (Ontario) peaches, regular brown sugar, and doubled the vanilla.  I'm guessing the better the peaches (and ripeness), the better the flavour.  We did serve this in individual heatproof greased crocks (for quicker baking and serving), with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream and a side of cinnamon walnut coffee cake.  I also made two other individual servings using artificial sweetener (used different small crocks to differentiate);  I should have dissolved in melted butter first as the powder didn't dissolve during the baking process, although the two guests that had those enjoyed them after stirring it up a bit.
3314	393	I used fresh peaches, gf flour, doubled the vanilla, and added a tad of butter. It wasn't very flavorful. I don't think that had to do with my changes as I didn't decrease the sugar. Although maybe bagged peaches have more sugar?
3315	393	Pretty easy to make. Didn't have enough flavor. Added a smidge bit of cinnamon, a little more brown sugar, and a little butter. Had it with ice cream. Will make again.
3316	393	I made this, but I added some cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg with a tad bit of butter to the crumble. it was awesome. served it with vanilla ice cream.
3317	394	This is so delicious. A beautiful loaf of bread to share with someone, too! It makes a large loaf. Definitely needed an hour to cook. Came out perfectly.
3318	394	Really tasty and moist I used fresh Colorado peaches and added some mini morsel chocolate chips. Thank you for the recipe.
3319	394	tasting it now, its very sweet, so would cut back more next time, and true to everyone's comments, the peach is barely noticeable, sadly, but very moist! thx again: i've made several peach cakes this Summer, so best 2 stick w/them 4 peaches!!
3320	394	I just added the bananas and diced peach directly to the batter, it gave the bread a nice texture.
3321	394	This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it as written and everyone loved it. I also make it with additional diced peaches added in and people love that too. It's very forgiving. Sometimes I have apples that are a little mealy, so I have thrown one in to the blended components in place of a banana and that works too.  Try it with what you have on hand and enjoy! Thanks for an awesome recipe! I use it all the time.
3322	394	good, but very bland. needs more spice
3323	394	Simply AMAZING! Best banana bread I have ever made!
3324	394	I always make a double recipe of this bread!  My daughter and I absolutely love it, and is one of her favorite surprises when she comes home from school.
3325	394	I made a double batch of this bread and baked it as mini loaves.  My oven must be on the hot side because some of the loaves got a little too brown on the outside.
3326	395	I love fruit so this is great for me!
3327	395	I loved this.  I added a teaspoon of honey and replaced the ice cream with low-fat vanilla yogurt.  It was sweet enough and was delicious!  The fruit was very fresh
3328	395	Delicious! This is the best smoothie ever!
3329	395	Really nice and simple. I didn’t have peaches, but it was great without them.
3330	395	It was one of the best smoothie I’ve ever tasted, I loved it.
3331	395	This was delicious. I never thought of adding apples to a smoothie. By the way, the correct order to add ingredients to the smoothie is milk first, then ice cream, ice and fresh fruit. Not the other other way around.  I only blended it once. I would make it again.
3332	395	Very good but need to add extra milk to make it a true smoothie.
3333	395	Delicious.  I didn’t use apple.
3334	395	Very Delicious! I used apples, strawberries, bananas and blueberries, added half-cup of almond milk and half-cup orange-mango juice with ice cubes.
3474	415	Fabulous! I made the original recipe. My husband’s new favorite pie.
3335	396	Delicious!  Used 2 cans of drained peaches no sugar added.  Baked at 350 degrees fir 45 minutes.  As reviewers suggested, I used 6 eggs and 1.5 cups of milk.  I sprinkled the top liberally with cinnamon, but next time I will add 1 tsp of cinnamon to egg mixture.  It was perfect sweetness and served with a dollop of whipped cream.  I used a whole loaf of french bread crammed into the pan, but had about 3 slices  leftover so cubed them and sprinkled them over the slices. As previoys reviewers suggested, I dipped the bread into the egg mixture before placing in pan.  Will definitely  make this again.
3336	396	Super Yum!!  You should try this.
3337	396	Loved this! We had some fresh Georgia peaches that I needed to use so I decided to make this for the grandkids. It was so good I made it again a few days later! First time I only used 3 peaches, second time I used 6. 3 was plenty but 6 was “more better!” I served it with half and half but plain is good.  Ice cream or whipped cream makes it a dessert! My husband thinks it tastes like a peach bread pudding, my daughter said she thought peach cobbler- either way a winner!
3338	396	This was delicious!!
3339	396	I followed the basics of this recipe in that I did NOT add milk as so many others did. I did half the recipe and used a little more than 2 cups of sliced fresh peaches. It was easy and fairly quick to put together the night before. Would have been quicker with canned peaches, but I had fresh I needed to use. A delicious French toast in a non-traditional flavor!
3340	396	A must for the grandkids. They love it! So do the adults. Xoxo
3341	396	Absolutely delicious!!  Made as written, with no substitutions.  Family loved it!!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing.
3342	396	I have been making this every year for my co-workers as a Christmas gift. I do a little more egg and milk. I also sprinkle nutmeg on top before refrigerating. This has been a BIG hit at work.
3343	396	This is a family favorite!  I usually serve it with a thick slice of ham - great sweet and salty combo.  Make it at least once a month for breakfast or dinner.
3344	397	My first try at fruit pie.  I cheated and used Pillsbury ready-to-bake crust.  Baked as directed and set aside to cool. Trying to judge by the peaches and nectarines I purchased (and tasted, 10 altogether) this is what I used:  1 c plus 2 T sugar, ¼ c water, 4 T cornstarch, ¼ t nutmeg and 1 t vanilla.  Placed all but vanilla in a saucepan and worked on peaches.  Once I sliced all I easily knew what to use for “mashed”.   Added the two cups of mashed to the sauce pan.  I did decide to put the mixture into a blender for just a minute before heating.  It thickened quickly.  Once off the heat I then added the vanilla and tasted.  I did start layering with sauce first, then peaches, alternately layering til full.  (Thanks to those that gave user comments for me to consider.)  Looked beautiful, next time no fork, see photo.  Into the fridge.  Reading additional comments, and with finished flavor, I will use cinnamon instead of nutmeg or a little of each next time.  All in all, great recipe.  Thanks!
3345	397	I have a love/hate relationship with this recipe.  I've made it several times.  I've never included the nutmeg, but the taste is fabulous.  I love this unbaked approach.  But in all the times I've made it (6-10), I've never gotten it to set up well.  I've eliminated the water and increased the cornstarch, but it's still really runny.  The flavor is amazing, though, so I'll keep trying.
3346	397	Made as written. Turned out great! Delicious, not super sweet, let’s fresh peaches really shine.
3347	397	4 stars all the way its a great recipe. I will make again with a few tweaks.
3348	397	Wonderful. I did add the extra tablespoon of cornstarch as recommended, probably used a tad more peaches (I used 10 peaches altogether that we got at Costco), and also 1/4 t. of cinnamon. Thank you!
3349	397	Not a fan of this flavor profile for a fresh peach pie, which should be bright, sweet, and tangy.  The vanilla and nutmeg really get in the way of the fresh peach flavor.  Just my $0.02.
3350	397	I’m amazed at how easy it was to make. I used a frozen crust; made sure all of my peaches were ripe and ready. I only used half of the vanilla because I didn’t want it taking over the peach flavor. Turned out delicious. Took it to a potluck for dessert and got great reviews served with vanilla ice cream.
3351	397	This was super easy! Followed the recipes exactly. The family gave it 10/10 stars!
3352	397	Reduced the sugar and loved the flavor. Also substituted tapioca for the flour.
3353	398	Love it
3354	398	Loved this so much! I had to improvise quite a bit because I did not have fresh fruit, so I used frozen peaches and mangoes (no pineapple). I love recipes like this that are conducive to using what you have on hand. Also had to leave out the yellow pepper but I had everything else. Used as a topping for carne al pastor over black beans & rice. OMG, I loved this! Can't wait to make it again.
3355	398	I left the mango and peaches out and it was very good anyway. Served it with Mahi Mahi and coconut rice. Just perfect!
3356	398	Loved this! Only thing I did different was add a little white wine vinegar but this is amazing!
3357	398	Awesome recipe!!! I doubled and going to try freezing and canning so I can have in winter. Used all fresh ingredients. I love cilantro so put as much as you want!
3358	398	Delicious!  We loved it. It makes a big batch.
3359	398	Turned out great. The whole family loved it.
3360	398	I added black beans  sweet corn, red onion and some garlic lime cilantro seasoning! Just amazing and delicious!
3361	398	Adjustments:
3362	399	the instructions were not to clear i.e. doesn't say what size casserole, do you drain the peaches, etc. Also, the net time I would put in less sugar. The flavor is good.
3363	399	I just tried this for the first time. The taste is wonderful but it’s a little soupy. Kind of disappointed with that.
3364	399	The taste is good. I only used 3/4 cup of milk for the batter. It doesn't say whether to drain the peaches or not. I did!. This recipe reminds me of a peach upside down cake more than a cobbler.
3365	399	I didn't put nutmeg and it wasn't missing it.
3366	399	I will make this again. I served this to company and they loved it.
3367	399	Easy recipe to follow and great tasting dish
3368	399	Tastes better with fresh ripe peaches, and instead of 1 cup of butter about a cup and a 1/4.
3369	399	I made this cobbler for a CNA who is caring for my mother-in-law isolated from the family due to covid.  The CNA texted me the following day, and asked if she could pay me to make a "bigger one"  for her to serve to her family on Easter Sunday!  Making two more tonight.  One for me & DH, and another to  share.
3370	399	Probably not.  Looked beautiful but the peach flavor didn't come through well enough.
3373	400	I have never had peach iced tea at any restaurant but what I can say is this is absolutely amazing! Not too sweet at all... Just perfect!
3374	401	Like the sound of the recipe.
3375	401	Great recipe, just waiting for my canning water to boil, I cooked it about 2 hours, until it looked the right consistency. The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 tsp Garam masala and just under a 1/2 cup of diced dried apricots. Can’t wait to see what everyone thinks this year at Christmas, it’s a nice addition to my traditional jalapeño jelly. Will make again. Thank you
3376	401	Flavor wise this is/was amazing!!!  Sadly, I should have believed the other reviewers.  I even read through and found the note from the author.  This also is NOT my first time making or canning a chutney.   After 2 hours I had a thin soupy mixture.  Nothing worth canning.  So boiled it away for nearly 4 MORE hours to get it to have any sort of thickness.  Then it was nearly 9pm so I caved and added some pectin as others suggested.  ::sigh::  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't!  Thank you for the fun flavors!
3377	401	Regardless on how you manage this, it is a good chutney to use as an accompaniment to many dishes.  I had to fudge some of the ingredients, but a chutney is basically sweet and sour with spice.  If you have those components, you can't go wrong. I used 5 yellow peaches with skin on that were turning, chunked versus diced, and I used fresh ginger. I also added some crushed allspice berries.
3378	401	I halved the ingredients but followed the recipe almost exactly otherwise and it turned out wonderfully.    It's very thick after 1.5 hours cooking on medium heat in a wide pot.  Flavor is great. Can't wait to have it for dinner tonight with poached fish and rice!
3379	401	Just made this recipe for the third day time.  Beautiful flavours and delightfully spicy.  Not sure why there is reference to a 10 hour total time.  Prep is under an hour and the 1.5 hour cooking time is bang on to achieve the right consistency.
3380	401	Fabulous!   Followed the recipe as posted.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a delicious recipe!
3381	401	Did look at other recipes for this at the same time and notice that the apple cider vinegar seemed a lot.  But decide to give it a go. Trust you gut it was way too much and the constancy  was way too running. My mum said on Face Time why waste peaches but I do love a good chutney. Had to improve on this to actually get what resembles a chutney.
3382	401	Loved the vinegary/picklely (?) taste with the peaches. I would, however, cut back on the brown sugar. Maybe 3 or 3 1/2 cups instead of 4? It's sweet in the pot. Perhaps, it will taste less sweet when pairing with cream cheese and crusty bread!
3383	402	Delicious. Made mine in cast iron fry pan. When done I Wrapped a towel  around whole pan and plate to flip over. Towel caught some burning hot filling.  Otherwise it works.
3384	403	This was great. Have made it several times now. I prefer the pears being very ripe for this dish. I only used 3 large pears and it filled the pie crust. It set up well in the time stipulated and was not too sweet. After the first cooking time I covered the edge of the crust to cook the topping, as it was already browning.
3385	403	Easy recipe, tastes delicious!
3386	403	I added peaches and pears and it come out amazing!
3387	403	Great pie! I love trying different pies and this one got a lot of compliments. I made it as is except that baked the pie crust for about 7-8 minutes before I added the mixture.
3388	403	Followed this recipe exactly, the pie turned out delicious! We will be making this again.
3389	403	This pie has mellow flavor.  Really good with the sour cream. Kinda of like custard ..  I loved it and will definitely make it again.
3390	403	I made this pie today. It is a beautiful pie. It is very bland. It was good but lacking. It may also need a longer cook time.
3391	403	My family loves this recipe!
3392	403	Amazing! I can't believe I made this.  I would order this in a restaurant.  Followed the recipe  as is.  The oatmeal topping is a nice touch compared to just a flour butter sugar crumb topping.  I have printed multiple copies for future generations.
3393	404	I will say the pie was delicious, I served it with whipped cream. However, I followed the directions exactly as written using drained/canned pears. The filling was loose, but I hoped it would firm up when baked. After cooling the pie and slicing it ,the filling was very loose and did not hold up. Maybe adding another TBS of flour would help? The filling was a gloopy mess and had to be scooped up with a spoon. I did bake it an extra 10 min, as could see that the filling  was still loose and jiggling when I used the exact instructions. This did not really help firm up the filling ..
3394	404	This odd sounding combination is amazing. MDH is a super pick eater, I figured he would turn his nose at it , but rather he loved it so much we ate the whole thing in 2 days and I made another.Thinking of trying one with fruit cocktail this time.  Will it be as good… probably not but I bet it’s still delicious. Made recipe as written it was perfect.
3395	404	I used Fresh pears from our trees. It turned out fabulous. I loved using the graham cracker crust as it didn’t get soggy like a normal pie crust. I will definitely be making this again!
3396	404	I thought it  is an excellent pie! I don't normally like fruit pies but I had some pears to use up. I used 4 ripe pears and 1 can of halved pears and ended up with enough filling for 2 pies. I didn't change anything else and I really like this pie. Will make it again!
3397	404	Very goood! Easy and I will def be making this again!
3398	404	This is a GREAT recipe to try, if you're looking for 'something a bit different'. I made it for Thanksgiving, and all loved it. The only change I would make would be to reduce the amount of butter in the crust by half; the full amount was enough to leak out the top of the pie and make a ghee-burn mess in my oven. I'll be making this one again, though with the butter reduction.
3399	404	I never ate or even heard of a pear pie before making this recipe but I was looking for a recipe that utilized the cans of pears I had. This pie is delicious!  it is refreshing and the crumb topping is amazing.
3400	404	Amazing!! Perfect as is. This was SO good and so very easy to make. It was a huge hit and I'll definitely be making it again!!
3401	404	The only change I made was to use fresh pears, approx. 5 large, and added a little cinammon on the top finishing dough. Very good. Thank you for the recipe.
3402	405	Followed it exactly, except for melting chocolate in microwave. Took longer to cook, choc filling never really firm. More like mousse/fudge. Delicious, but actually too much chocolate (never thought I would say that). I should have made a more artistic arrangement of pears - used 4, completely overwhelmed by chocolate.  Used Scharffenberger chocolate. Probably would not make again. Why is this recipe not in app?
3403	405	Very good. Very rich.
3404	406	hey this was a great recipe 5 stars for it
3405	406	This was delicious and beautiful.  Everyone really liked it.  I used three pears and it was perfect.  If the pears are a bit softer it is even better. My pears were too hard, but it still tasted great.
3406	406	Everyone that got a slice loved it. They asked when I was making more. Thanks for the lovely recipe
3407	406	I made this pie in individual tarts which were so pretty. These are a little on the sweet side for us, but very creamy and delicious.  This recipe was a great use of the  abundant pears we had on our tree.
3408	406	This came out very nice. After reading through the reviews I used about 5 pears with nutmeg sprinkled on and subbed 1/4 c brown sugar & 1/4 c white sugar. I had grabbed my almond flavoring instead of vanilla but it came out really delicious.
3409	406	Easy, showy, unique
3410	406	This pie was a HOOT! I used my family recipe (the Joy of Cooking with some minor changes) for the pie crust and about three voluptuous pears instead of two wimpy ones and it was DEEEEEElicious. My father ate it right up!! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy, luscious, delectable dessert!!! Enjoy ;)
3411	406	dammmmmmm goood
3412	406	Easy recipe and delicious!! I added another egg because we like it creamy and custardy. I also covered the outside pie crust with tin foil for 40 mins of the 60 mins to avoid burning and drying it out.
3413	407	Just average.  I would not make this again.   Will go back to my sour cream crust.
3414	407	The fruit was delicious but the tart was so hard we needed a knife to cut it. A bit embarrassing since I brought it to family dinner.
3415	407	This tart was delicious.  It was a nice alternative to apple pie at thanksgiving.
3416	407	I haven't actually cut the pie yet, but I did pick a few pieces of fruit off of the top. Delicious. A few changes were made because of the ingredients that were already in the house. I used about 6 small sand pears and 2 small golden delicious apples. Because I had so much fruit (I had to use it all as the apples were becoming wrinkled in the fruit bowl) I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Used all spice instead of cardamom. 1/8 teaspoon of ginger and almond essence. I also did not use all of the liquid.  As you can see from the picture, I didn't arrange the fruit either.   The pears stay crunchy. Crust nice. I prefer a sweet crust.  Husband loved it
3417	407	Fantastic recipe as is, but also super flexible. Have used whatever fruit or jam I have on hand with equally delicious results. Makes quite and impression when brought to dinner parties.
3418	407	The taste of pear did not come out, and nutmeg was too strong.
3419	407	My 12 year old daughter has made this recipe many times, and it never fails to please. She does drain out the orange juice - otherwise you will have an apple tart mess. She pain stakingly arranges the fruit in a beautiful design, and the presentation is gorgeous. She has made it in small pans for individual servings and in a large pan. It's simply delicious.
3420	407	I had trouble with the crust.  I used gf flour but even so, the dough was just crumbly and couldn't be rolled out.  I ended up pressing it into the pans.
3421	407	This is a very nice adaptable method! I've got my second pear/honey/peach-jam/almond version in the oven right now. Always fun to get the baking bug and realize you have no brown sugar, etc. ;-)  I'm keeping this one on hand!
3422	408	This is absolutely delicious, I can't say enough how good it was.
3423	408	My Husband and I both loved it! Made it just the way it is written (which is how I think you should do to review the recipe). Very good with frozen vanilla yogurt!
3424	408	We used just 4 cups of pears, they more than filled the pie shell
3425	408	Definitely keeping this recipe.
3426	408	My first pear pie and it was delicious. Not hard to make either.
3427	408	I was unsure about the cheddar, but this dish turned out to be delicious!! Like many other reviewers, I skipped the crust and just made it as a crisp.  I also doubled the recipe and gave one to my neighbors, who very much enjoyed it. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. I used medium cheddar, and it was perfect. I’ll definitely be making this again! Next time I might add a bit of nutmeg, just to give it an extra amount of autumn zing!
3428	408	Very easy and got rave reviews at a dinner party. Served with a nice dessert wine.
3429	408	This was delicious.
3430	408	I made this for a Christmas party last weekend. It was one of the first pies to be gobbled up!
3431	409	I made this using a Pillsbury puff pastry and a 9" round pie dish.
3432	409	Five stars for ease! I did change vanilla extract to almond extract in the cheese mixture, but am certain it would have been just as flavorful with Vanilla.
3433	409	Very yum.  .  I used homemade gluten free sourdough pastry,  dairy free cream cheese and the ginger suggestions and apart from it spilling all over my oven  .....  VERY worth the time  ....  thank you :)
3434	409	The recipe really interested me. I was concerned about one review that said the cook would not make it again, "no wow factor."  Sooo I took the next review and turned it up to high. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger to the cream cheese mixture PLUS 1 1/2 teaspoons of finely diced candied ginger (Penzey's) to the cream cheese and sugar mixture. Wow! This is fabulous. I had not imagined before that ginger and pears were such a perfect match. Every year I will look forward to this delight!
3435	409	I thought this was just okay. I would not make this again. Pears were cooked perfectly. No wow factor.
3436	409	Unbelievably easy!! I did a trial run for Thanksgiving.  I used gluten free puff pastry (Nicole Hunn's recipe) and ginger sugar.
3437	409	So easy, so pretty, so delicious!
3438	410	Loved it! easy and delicious. I did not have almonds or almond extract, so I used pecans and vanilla extract instead.
3439	410	First time making a tart - ever, and it turned out to be very delicious.
3440	411	This was a wonderful recipe! I started it and then realized I was out of puff pastry, so I used phyllo instead- a little butter between the sheets and it was golden. Aside from that the only thing I think I'd do again is add a pinch of salt to the sauce. It was soooo good! Yum!
3441	411	I used phyllo dough on the bottom as opposed to the puff pastry, gave it more of a baklava texture.
3442	411	This came out really good.  The syrup is really was sweet with a nice maple flavor. Another reviewer includes bourbon which would go great with this flavor profile.  The puff pastry was soft but not mushy. My husband was able to pick it up and eat it like a slice of pizza. Overall, its a was great recipe that is easy to make.
3536	428	Absolute favorite!! I’ve made & shared many times, people always love it.I often omit the cheese to make it vegan/ plant based for myself.
3443	411	I followed the recipe , I drained most of the juice out of the skillet before baking.  I took the pastry out and put on a plate right side up and put the remaining juice around the plate.  I kept it right side up so the pastry would not get soggy.  Thanks for the great recipe!
3444	411	My husband took this out of the oven, flipped it, and started to eat it. He declares it delicious.
3445	411	I made it just as written and it was excellent!  I pears were extra firm, which I was worried about but it turned out great.  Will for sure make again.
3446	411	I would definitely make this again. I made this for Christmas with my Husband's family and they loved it!   I added a splash of ginger brandy to the sauce and cooked the sauce a little longer to let it thicken.  YUM!
3447	411	Added a splash of good Kentucky Bourbon to the sauce and cooked it in the oven about 7 minutes longer until the crust was a golden brown.....,,yum!!
3448	411	I made the recipe as written, but also added a splash of bourbon to the sauce. Puff pastry tends to always be a little chewy (I use it in other recipes such as chicken pot pie), so maybe next time I might try another option, like phyllo.
3449	412	What a mess!! This is a soupy mess. I cooked it for 45 minutes and it never set. Don't make it!!
3450	412	Watery mess.  Good flavor .
3451	412	WET DISASTER. Baked for 50 minutes and it is still terrible. House smells great though.
3452	412	I've never made a fresh fruit pie before so I was glad to find a good base recipe to experiment with.  (Tip: If you're working with fresh pears, the easiest way that I've found to peel them is to boil them for about 20-30 seconds one at a time and have a bowl of cold water on hand.  After you boil one, just plop it in the bowl and just lightly rub on the skin under water with your thumb...peels right off and the skins just sink to the bottom.)  After I peeled and cut them I put them in a gallon plastic bag and poured about a shot each of brandy and spiced rum.  I also put all of the spices in the bag that the recipe called for (with a little extra cinnamon bc I like the flavor).  I let it marinate in the fridge for about 6ish hours and then prepared the filling.  I felt the pie needed a "topping" so on half of the pie I sprinkled some Coach's Oats on the top.     Results:  Flavor was excellent!  I liked the oat side better than the non-oat side but both were good.  I didn't dry off the pears or try to dehydrate them a little before adding the liquor and such so it turned out a bit more liquidy than I'd like so I think next time I'm going wipe them down a bit with some paper towels before adding the liquids...and maybe bake it about 5ish minutes longer.
3453	412	This was easy and fast and taste great. I baked it for 40 min. Will make again!
3454	412	I made it exactly to the directions.  It was runny and had too much allspice.  Next time I will try adding tapioca pudding mix and baking a little longer.  I will add more cinnamon and less allspice.  I was sad this time though since I made three for my work Christmas party.  Everyone was excited to try it and it was just mediocre.
3455	412	As usual, I lacked some of the ingredients. Only had about 2/3 of the white sugar, so substituted Splenda brown sugar for the rest of the white as well as the brown sugar. Found a recipe for allspice- 1/3 each of nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Used salted butter- no unsalted. Greased the bottom of a 9x9 inch pan, because I had no crust.
3456	412	I make this pie with coconut oil instead of butter to make it dairy-free.
3457	413	This recipe is so easy and so tasty! I used canned pears and no lemon (didn't have any). And based on another review, I added 2 Tbsp corn starch to my pears before adding the sugar. The pie wasn't runny or soggy  at all. I'll definitely make this again!
3458	413	Definitely a winner! I halfed the recipe because my pie pan is kind of on the small side. I also used powder nutmeg because I don't have fresh nutmeg to grate. Came out so good!
3459	413	Never had pear pie, sorry it took this long.  Very flavorful.
3460	413	Delicious. Even my dad, who isn’t a big fan of pears, enjoyed it. Ginger can be added instead of nutmeg.
3461	413	i put crust line n top he graham cracker crumbs
3462	413	Yum
3463	413	It was very good.  Fresh Nutmeg is a must.  Next time a little less sugar.
3464	413	Used pears and apples since I didn't have enough pears. Added some lemon preserves to the fruit mixture for added flavor and added chopped pecans to the topping. Very flavorful. Only complaint is that it was too juicy. Next time I'll add corn starch to the fruit mixture.
3465	413	This was really good.  My pears seemed a bit juicy, so I added just a little bit of flour to the pears before putting the crumb topping on.  I also added a bit of ginger to the crumb topping.  The only complaint I have is that it was still very wet after baking causing a bit of sogginess, but the flavor was delightful. I love that it wasn't a pear pie trying to be an apple pie.
3466	414	Made exactly as written except used a Macintosh Apple as I had those on hand. Super easy to make with a nice spice blend.   I got 7  4” rounds from the 9” crust and had enough filling left over for 4 more pies. Use larger rounds to make filling them easier and get a good filling-to-pastry ratio.
3467	415	I’ve made this pie several times with and without crust. I like to substitute full fat, plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Usually I add oats and walnuts to the topping for extra nutrition. And I always cut the sugar by at least half. Still comes out perfect!However, I’m wondering if I can freeze this after or before baking?Would sour cream or my modification  of yogurt make it come out too runny?
3468	415	Love this recipe! I've made it multiple times. I only use about half the amount of butter for the topping. But other than that, it's great! I've also made it with pears AND apples, which was really good.
3469	415	Absolutely delicious! I subbed half the sour cream with Greek yogurt and it turned out delicious! A plus rating!
3470	415	I had a lot of pears due to joining a fruit and vegetable delivery box place.  I used the yellow colored pears to make this pie.  I did it using the instructions, and it was surprisingly delicious.  My wife loved it too.  It goes great with vanilla ice cream.   This was also the first pie I've ever made.
3471	415	I did the same thing as one other reviewer. Put the topping on right at the start. And used nutmeg instead of cinnamon as was suggested by another’s review. This pie was delicious . . . a definite keeper. 5 stars
3472	415	Pretty good, i made 2 of them. One i made following recipe and it turned out great. The other i had to substitute for gluten and sugar free which was okay but not as good. I found that almond extract does a better job of hiding the sweetener than vanilla extract
3473	415	My neighbor gave me some pears from her pear tree last year. This pie is now my favorite pie ever.  So good. Recipe is spot on, no changes are needed.
3475	415	Delicious Pie! Based on another suggestion about the topping consistency, I used 2 1/2 T sugar, 3/4 C flour, 3 T butter, & a pinch of nutmeg for the topping.  It made a thin crunchy top.  The recipe's 3 cups of sliced pears were just the right amount for a store bought 'deep dish 9" frozen pie crust.
3476	416	used egg withe unsterd
3477	416	We made it per the instructions and the center wasn't set. We left it in longer to firm up the center. The center never firmed up. Eventually we had to give up as the crust was turning too dark.
3478	416	this recipe makes a delicious tart like pie ;  the custard was exceptionally good and I intend to use it for future fruit tarts.
3479	416	YUM! I did use 1/2 vanilla extract and 1/2 almond extract, but otherwise I followed this recipe as written and the pie tastes like heaven.
3480	416	This pear pie tasted fine, but it is kind of boring.  I think a non custard recipe, something more like an apple pie, would be better.
3481	416	Absolutely delicious - followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I'm sure there are adjustments that could be made, but start with the original and go from there.  I'm going to add ground almonds to the crust next time.  The consistency was perfect and the almond flavoring really enhanced the pears.  This will be a staple!
3482	416	This was delicious.  I followed a few reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1/2 Cup, added a little cinnamon and vanilla and sprinkled the top with brown sugar.  I'm looking forward to trying with other fruits such as mangos, and strawberries which will need more sugar.
3483	416	Great! very quick and easy to make.  I only had 2 eggs and the custard texture was perfect.  Will try with less sugar next time as found a tad too sweet but then did sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on during cooking!
3484	416	This was so quick and easy to whip up...will be good when guest drop by.  First time have ever made a fresh pear pie and this is delicious way to eat your pears.
3485	417	An addendum to my original comment - I did use almonds instead of hazelnuts simply because I prefer their flavor, but I followed all other instructions and it came out perfectly.
3486	419	Show stopper!Although I did take liberties.  Substituted  a cup of Almond flour for regular, swapped out some butter for cream cheese, didn’t cook the pears, just fanned them out on top and sprinkled with sugar.Acclaimed by all.Be warned, the crust is wonderfully crunchy but gets soggy after a few days.  Share while its fresh.
3487	419	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!! SO AMAZING! Would love to make this again sometime. The only thing for me was that the pears got too dry, but I liked it overall!
3488	419	Ok, so, I wanted this to be this beautiful dessert, with the pears all fanned out on top in a gorgeous pattern . . . but that didn't happen. BUT - this is DELICIOUS! OMG . . . really awesome! I learned a few things while making this. 4 pears is too many for a 9" tart. I ended up poaching 3, and only ended up using about 2-1/2 of them (they were delicious, so I just ate the leftovers). There is too much of the frangipane filling as well. I used all of it, and when I placed the pears on top, the pears sunk into the filling (hence not the beautiful presentation that I was hoping for) and while it was baking, the filling went over the edges and onto the baking sheet (good call on having a baking sheet under the tart pan)! I also didn't use blanched almonds. I just ground them up in my food processor, which I'd do again.  The flavor is wonderful though, so I'd definitely make this one again. Oh, and that poaching liquid - I strained that and have been  using it to sweeten a cup of tea. It's just lovely!
3489	420	Really good. Made recipe into pie and added the suggested topping.  Hubby & I loved!
3490	420	So delish!
3491	421	This was enjoyed by all who tried it.  I made the topping as written and had to throw it out, there was no way it was going to go from goop to crumbly.  I started over and used cold butter which I cut in and that worked out beautifully.
3492	421	We used an oreo crumb crust and added a few cherries to the filling, and it worked well.  The surface stayed pasty white, even when we baked it for 15 minutes more than the recommended time, so we ended up  putting the oven on broil for a couple of minutes to make it brown.  My family thought it tasted even better straight from the fridge the next day.
3493	421	Delightful, I used brown sugar instead of white and prebaked the crust wrapping the edge with foil so it wouldn't brown. I also used more flour in the topping and then added sliced candied almonds (Trader Joes) on top of the crumbs - yummy!!
3494	421	It was okay. I won't make again. I added dried cranberries. Glad I did or it would have been just Pears in a slightly chalky white stuff with a tasty crumb crust.
3495	421	It was my first time making a pie! I just want to say that it was super delicious! I just change the sour cream for natural yogurt. Thanks for the recipe
3496	421	I was really impressed with this pear pie. However, I did make a couple of changes. I used sugar substitute (my husband's diabetic) and I used Greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream.
3497	421	This pie is delicious and easy to make. It tastes almost like an apple pie. Definitely will make this again!
3498	421	Our neighbors have a pear tree, so we are always baking "pear something".  Since he gives me the pears (He never uses them), I always make extra goodies for them. I am not a big fan of apple pie so I was hoping this wouldn't taste like too much like apple pie. It doesn't at all!   This is a delicious pie!
3499	421	Wonderful!  Followed exactly.  The pear filling was amazing!
3500	422	I made this pie late in the evening so it's problems may have been down to my own tiredness and inexperience.
3501	422	i made a Jump Rope Crisp! This is one of the YUMMIEST i've ever made. the combination of fruits and the spices make a spectacular taste sensation.  The ginger just takes it right over the top!  This is definitely a keeper.Thanks for sharing your lovely recipe Jody!
3502	422	I made this pie for a family gathering and everyone raved about it. Raved, I tell you. I created the recipe, it was great the first time I made it, and it was a huge hit the most recent time. It will remain one of my favourite go-to pie recipes.
3503	423	I was so intrigued by this recipe, but did not want to make 2 pies to try it out, so I halved it. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I am sorry to say this was a disappointment. The bottom crust did not cook and the pie was very wet. There was a sort of chalky, raw taste to it, I think from the cornstarch. I am not sure I would try to make this one again.
3504	424	I didn't make any changes to the  recipe.  So the good: the pear mixture tasted great we had leftover and  loved getting to snack on it.  The bad: my dough literally melted down in the oven, it was awful.  I think the dough needs to remain cold.  And each step needs to be done quickly and I think my dough warmed up too much. But without trying again that's my best guess.
3505	425	Followed it exactly and with the powdered pectin as it states.  It turned out perfect!  Nothing syrupy about this recipe as some have said so possibly they aren't using the proper pectin or bringing it to a full boil.  It should boil aggressively.
3506	425	reduced sugar to 4 cups and deleted nutmeg.  Reduced the all spice  to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp  of cinnamon.  Great flavor but way too liquidy.
3507	425	This recipe is amazingly easy. Thank you .
3508	425	None this was the way my mom always made them
3509	425	This recipe makes a delicious preserve! Easy too! After reading quite a few reviews I did make a couple of adjustments. 1) Used 8 cups cut up pears because I wanted to use up what I had.  2) Used 5 cups of regular sugar and 1/2 cup of the brown sugar. 3) Only used 3/4 teaspoon each of the spices, adding cinnamon to the mix. I simmered the pears for about 25-30 minutes then mashed, leaving some small pieces of pear. This recipe made 7 half pint and 2 pint jars of the preserves. It is a thicker syrupy kind of preserve.....perfect for pancakes, muffins, toast, on ice cream, etc. Definitely a keeper!!
3510	425	Love  the  spiciness!   However,  as  others  have  previously  commented,  I  had  way  more  syrup  than  pears--which  floated  to the  tops of the jars.  I tried another recipe which used more than twice the  amount of  pears and half the  sugar.  I still  have  more pears so will play with both recipes.
3511	425	I'm 62 years old and grew up canning everything...vegetables, fruits, etc.  There is no way this recipe is correct.  WAY too much sugar.  All you get is syrup.  I plant fruit trees and have several on my property.  I couldn't wait too can some pears from a tree that I planted 3 years ago.  This was its first harvest so not many pears.  I'm so disappointed that I used this recipe.  Terrible to say the least.  So sorry for the bad review.  I've never done this before but you need to correct this recipe as it just can't be right.
3512	425	Great
3513	425	Loved the recipe!  Very easy to follow.  I made a couple of changes.  I reduced the sugar by 2 cups, using 6, instead of 8.  I also halved the amount of allspice and nutmeg.   They were still plenty sweet  and they had  the right amount of spice for my taste.  They really taste like the pear preserves my Grandma used to make!
3514	348	Home grown pears are so sweet that I only needed 3-1/2 cups sugar and half the spices.  Recipe is pear-fecto.  Definitely a keeper.
3515	348	It taste delicious!  I had two bags of Sand pears from my son's tree. My husband and I peeled them all and I  ended up cutting up about 5 apples as well to add to the mix. I multiplied  each ingredient  × 6 except for the cloves and sugar. I  used about  3 teaspoons of ground cloves and 11 cups of sugar. It made 39 (1/2 pints). Mine has the texture and taste of applebutter. But it is really tasty!
3516	348	So horrendously sweet it is unusable.  I even cut back on the sugar because my gut told me it was too much.  I'm heartbroken about wasting some of the best pears I've ever had on it, in addition to an hour of my life.  I even like really sweet sweets ~ I'm not a no-sugar nut.  I suggest using 1/4 of the amount in the recipe.  I also eliminated all spices except for a dash of cinnamon.  If a fruit is really good, you don't need to drown it in camouflage.
3517	348	Super easy and delicious!
3518	348	Wow!!! First time making pear jam ever! Followed the recommendations from others to half the spices and add. full packet of sure gel... PERFECT! Tastes amazing!!
3519	348	This was a Christmas gift for my teacher friends! We are all teaching online and they need something sweet because this year has been sour!!
3520	348	This was my first time making jam, or canning anything, hoenstly. Per the other reviews, I halved the spices, but I added three jalapenos (seeds and membranes included) for some heat. It didn't firm up to regular jam consistency,  so maybe I should have used the whole packet of pectin. But, that said, it is suuuuuuper delicious!
3521	348	The spices overpowered the pear taste in my opinion. Very sweet
3522	348	To much sugar cut in three  cut the spoce on half
3523	427	Made this this evening but used less than half the sugar suggested which is why it has 4 rather than 5 stars.I used wholemeal floor as well.There is a cup and a half of sugar in this. You really don’t need it. I put about half a cup of sugar into the crumble and about 1/8 of a cup in with the fruit. It was tasty and delicious. Also cooked it in a combi microwave + grill for 14 minutes and so saved power. Served with Greek yoghurt. A substantial and fairly healthy pudding.
3524	427	I made it with 4 cups of apples instead and it was super super delicious! I brought it to our friends' dinner and served with vanilla ice cream and everyone said it was the perfect desert. I have added maybe a teaspoon of cornstarch in the filling because some apples are very watering, and it turned perfect. It will be my to go desert from now on. It's cheap and super easy to make with pantry ingredients. Takes 10 min to put it all together. So easy and delicious!
3525	427	I made half a recipe, using 1 Asian pear and 1 apple and walnuts instead of almonds as those were the ingredients on hand.  Cut sugar to 1/4 cup in both the filling and topping, baked in 4 ramekins. Got rave reviews served to a friend. Looking forward to the leftovers for breakfast!
3526	427	Reduced the sugar to 1/2c in topping, none in fruit, and it came out perfect.
3527	427	Love it! Used Bosc pears, one honey crisp and one royal gala apple, and added a dash of ground clove and nutmeg.
3528	427	Just made this yummy easy dish, too sweet for our family, will def make again with half the sugar
3529	427	I made a larger batch and added cinnamon in the topping and the fruit. This was really good but I wished I added another fruit like blackberries or maybe craisins. I will have to try it next time.
3530	427	Totally worth making, simple and very tasty! I used Bosc pears and King Apples. All ingredients were prepared as listed. Super tasty autumn dessert, smells so wonderful while it’s baking!
3531	427	I make this several times every year to use up the apples and pears that grow in our backyard! Love it’s simplicity and lack of crust. The only change I make is to cut the brown sugar down to a half cup in both parts.??
3532	428	Loved it. Subbed honey for sugar and didn't caramelize pecans. Everyone that I've shared it with loves it too.
3533	428	FabEverything was amazing.
3534	428	This salad is delicious!  Our new favorite salad. Ripe D Anjou pears are really good in this salad.  Made it with original blue cheese (our favorite).  Made the pecans as directed, excellent.  Will use the pecans in other salads too.  Couldn’t stop munching on them.
3535	428	Amazing. Made exactly as recipe stated. This got rave reviews from my very picky girlfriends at our annual holiday dinner. The dressing is what really makes it. Will be making for my family Christmas dinner. Thank you for sharing!
3538	428	Wow, the combination of flavors in this salad is amazing, especially with the dressing!  I made it without cooking the pecans in sugar and it's still delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.
3539	428	I’ve make this salad every Thanksgiving by my family’s request. I use a spring mix salad and substitute the yellow mustard for Dijon mustard. I never caramelize the pecans, just use them raw. Everyone loves it! Thanks for the recipe!
3540	428	Excellent recipe!!  Love it!!!
3541	429	This was my first time ever making jelly or jam and my first time canning anything and I'm s pleased with how it turned out!
3542	429	First time ever making jams or jelly.  Picked our prickly pears and followed the recipe instructions from processing.   Ended up with enough juice for three batches so that's what we made.  Follows the recipe exactly except we used four packages of sure-jel instead of three.  Ended up with 9 pints and it turned out perfect!  Beautiful dark burgundy color and great flavor!  Will be giving some as gifts with the treat baskets we send to the neighbors.
3543	429	Good recipe, but DO NOT BOIL THE PECTIN!!!  You’ll destroy it and the jelly won’t gel.  I made this once, casually following the recipe and it came out great.  I made it again following the recipe to the letter and it will not gel.
3544	429	I made the recipe and it didn't set. It is syrup.
3545	429	I had never made jelly but a friend had given us a jar hiis mother made and my grandson loved it. Looking at all my beautiful prickly pears I decided to try I tripled the recipe and it turned out like a pro. The only thing I did different my blender was broken and I had not replaced it yet so I chunked up the pears and cooked it down using a sieve I separated the pulp and it  worked great. It is a lot of work getting the fruit ready but the rest is easy I got the juice ready one day put it in the fridge and cooked the jelly the next day.
3546	429	Easy to make. I uses old Sure jell...lol...I will either have firm jelly or I will use the Prickly Pear Cactus Syrup...lol in some drink recipes.
3547	429	Great, easy to use recipe!
3548	429	Made as written, came out well.
3549	429	In place of a blender (which is major overkill for macerating tunas!) I use a manual food mill. After gently scrubbing off the hair-like glochids on the fruit's surface I remove the outerskin as suggested, place the fruit with seeds in the food mill and voilá, seed-free juice ready for use! This batch is going to make tuna gelato.
3550	430	Great way to use up pears if you get a box of them for Christmas!  Lovely moist cake (I used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites) and it was delicious!
3551	430	Great recipe to use up pears that I have modified a bit after making it at least 30 times. I use 2 eggs instead of egg whites. Triple the spices.  Add a tablespoon of vanilla.  This has taken it to a 5 star recipe for me. My kids and co-workers love this one!
3552	430	This cake was absolutely delicious. We have a pear tree and I wanted to use up my pears…I will definitely make this cake every year.Frosted the cake with just a glaze. Yummy!
3553	430	This is an excellent cake recipe! The only modifications I make are adding a little less sugar (when the pears are ripe they are plenty sweet enough) and a lot more nuts! Great cake for fall!
3554	430	First time I made a cake with pears and this recipe looked good as did the comments.  The only thing I changed was I used about 2 tsp. Penzey's Pie Spice instead of separate spices listed  as I find it is a good blend of cloves, cinnamon, star anise, ginger and vanilla.  I also added the pie spice with the sugar as one comment mentioned so it blended.  WIll definitely make this again!
3555	430	Delicious cake! I replaced a third of the oil with butter as I like buttery taste. Also used ginger instead of nutmeg and cream cheese instead of eggs. It took a bit longer to bake and cool to be ready due to a lot of moisture, and a turned out to be a bit dense like a loaf, but yummy!
3556	430	This was great! A fantastic way to use up pears that were just starting to go brown. I made it in two loaf pans so I could share it. It just kept getting more moist each day, and lasted several days very well.
3557	430	Scrap the nutmeg and substitute ginger in the same amount. Also, the pears make the dough VERY wet, so you may need to extend the cook time if you're even a smidge over the 3 cups of pears they recommend. Might not be a bad idea to soak up some of the pear juice with paper towels before mixing with the sugar actually. But the flavor and texture is fabulous. Walnuts worked nicely in place of pecans.
3558	430	So delicious! Personally I found it a bit too sweet, and next time will omit some sugar. I cut my pear pieces to approximately half inch chunks, and next time I will make them smaller. Also note that the batter is VERY thick, and you can't quite "pour" it as mentioned in the recipe. Don't worry- it still bakes wonderfully!
3559	431	What is so good about this is that it isn't heavy.  I added a little more to the topping.  We like oatmeal.  I didn't end up having enough pears, so I used some apples too. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough of those either so I added some blueberries too.  Other than that I followed the directions except for about an extra 1/2 tsp of the ginger (because it was already chopped)  I think I personally would like the powdered ginger, but that is just me.  I wouldn't have added any more.  Hubs gave it a 5.  We served it warm with ice cream.
3560	431	This was great. I added dried cranberries to the pear mixture. I also added chopped walnuts to the topping. Served with vanilla ice cream.
3561	431	Unfortunately the ginger in this recipe didn't work for my family.  I guess we will just stick to the normal spices for our next crisp.   Also the oats didn't get moist enough.  After the 35 min. of baking at the 375 temp, I needed to spray a bit of moisture to the top and keep it in for another 5 min.
3562	431	Made this recipe just the way it was and it was perfect!! Just the right amount of everything! The crisp couldn't have been better. will definitely make again!
3563	431	Perfect- but I quadrupled the ginger because we love ginger.
3564	431	Horrible.   It needs liquid of some kind.  The pears didn’t have enough juice on their own to cook into the deliciousness of the picture.
3565	431	This was delicious. I used dried ground ginger because that’s what I had on hand, and I probably should have used a little less for that reason, but I really enjoyed the ginger bite to this, it’s delicious with the pears.
3566	431	Love the flavor and how easy it was to make.  I ended up using 1/2 the amount of ginger, because I used powdered ginger, as I didn't have crystal ginger.  I brought it over to my sister's house, and baked it in her oven, while we enjoyed a wonderful end of summer swim.  They both loved it too.  Not too sweet and the flavors just meld together.  I used pears from our yard... so happy with the results.  Will save this recipe and will make it again!  Delicious!!!!
3567	431	Turned out Wonderful...used Truvia brown sugar to lower the calories...looks great and tastes great..thank you..we love this recipe !   It's a keeper
3568	432	It's particularly good with pears.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts to the topping and that worked well.
3569	432	I followed all steps exactly and mine turned out very soupy, hardly a solid. I dont know what I did wrong, it still tasted great though so 3 stars :)
3570	432	Absolutely love this, made it multiple times. For those of you who prefer more of the sweet crumble topping to pear ratio like we do, I suggest doubling or tripling the topping. Thats how we like it - cant get enough of that!
3571	432	Absolutely love it .. so easy to make.  After I put the butter and syrup on, I turned the pears over and over gently to coat them!  Delish.
3572	432	I used Asian pears  Yum
3573	432	very easy-I used canned pears for a faster bake time...taste great
3574	432	This turned out way more delicious than I expected! I think I used 6.5 pears instead of 4, and I peeled them for good measure. It looked a little soupy right out of the oven but thickened up a little upon cooling. Fantastic!
3575	432	I made this recipe for the first time and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. It has just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. He's already asking when will I make it again.
3576	432	I followed the recipe as almost as written. The only thing I did was instead of the rolled oats, i used 6 pkgs of Quaker instant maple & brown sugar oats in the little packages. ?I also followed someone else’s recommendation and added some coconut to the mix as well as put some on top. And I also added some Cajun cooked pecans to the mix. It is so delicious! I’ll make this again one day when I decide  I’m not going to follow my diet. This is worth cheating with it’s so good!?
3577	433	Wonderful!
3578	433	I followed others and used a can of sliced pears and I had to substitute the balsamic vinegar for rice vinegar. But it was very very good! I also put in just a little less than 1/4 olive oil.
3579	433	This was so good! I don’t normally choose vinaigrette and don’t love vinegar in general. The pear and white wine are a nice balance for the vinegar. A little goes a long way! I love that this is made without sugar or other additives I am trying to avoid.
3580	433	This was absolutely fabulous.  I made it for a salad course ,  my only change was the white balsamic I had was a cranberry infused. I don’t think that altered the taste much. You really could not taste cranberry in the vinegar.   I did only half amount of dijon.   I would recommend highly.
3581	433	Somewhat sweet but good if adding Gorgonzola or feta to the salad greens. I didn’t use wine but had a pear vinegar from the farmers market that I used. It gave it a lot of depth. Filled a pint jar
3582	433	Very easy family loved it!
3583	433	Carmelized walnuts would work as well in this salad. Delicious! I can't wait to try out on guests and see their reaction.
3584	433	I thought this was a tasty, light dressing.  I didn't have white balsamic, so used regular balsamic vinegar.  Also, I used 2 pears, instead of one.I was in a hurry, and decided not to peel the 2nd pear.  The blender did a great job, so there's no bits of skin in the dressing. Other than that, I followed the recipe. With tons of pears on my tree, I'll definitely be making this again, but will try it without peeling either pear.
3585	433	Similar to Trader Joes but without all the chemicals.
3586	434	Very good. I added a vanilla glaze on top.
3587	434	Would give this 5 stars, but I don't feel right about that when I tweaked the recipe. I used nearly 3 cups of chopped pears added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg went with 1 & 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. My picky wife loved the loaf without pecans and friends loved the loaf with pecans!
3588	434	We cannot taste the pears.
3589	434	It was great ,very moist and flavorful, even better the next day.  Yummy good!
3590	434	This breakfast bread has become a family favorite.  I cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup, but that's it.  We love it.
3591	434	I have made muffins using several good recipes from this website. I use this bread recipe to make muffins and they are awesome and my favorites!  Setting the servings to 13 makes 12 large muffins. I change the spices each time I make them. Sometimes I use fresh pears and sometimes canned ones. I add a tablespoon or so of molasses - personal preference. And I use half white sugar and half dark brown sugar.
3592	434	Smells so goood while it's baking. Delicous too!
3593	434	I made a few changes.  I added a bit more pears as I have many from my trees.  I also made it a little "spicier" by adding ginger, clove and nutmeg to the mix.  I also made some cream cheese icing/spread and used as an "add-on" if wanted.  It was quite tasty.
3594	434	It was great!  I used applesauce instead of oil for the first time ever in any recipe, and even my picky husband loved it.  It didn’t taste overwhelmingly like pears, but we both thought:  what do pears actually taste like in any recipe?  Not a strong taste.  We had tons of pears off of our own trees.  I finely chopped then instead of grating.  It was moist and good.  Look forward to seeing how it toasts in the morning.  I put one/half cup finely chopped pecans in one loaf and none in the other for my son.  Anxious to see what he thinks.  This recipe is a keeper, as far as we are concerned!
3595	435	This was so yummy.  I will be using this recipe again.
3596	435	I strained the liquid from the crockpot and sealed it in jars. Great tasting dark honey. I took the fruit that was a topaz color and smashed it up. It’s delicious pear butter which I keep in the refrigerator
3597	435	I read several of the reviews where they talked about using less sugar. I made this today using 8 cups of chopped pears,  12 ounces of unsweetened pineapple juice and 4 cups of sugar. I cooked the fruit and juice for 30 minutes, then used an immersion blender to break the fruit down even more. I then added the 4 cups of sugar and cooked it in low for 3 hours. I ended up with 7 half pints of this gorgeous, delicious yumminess! I’m so glad I cut back on the sugar because It is sweet enough for us! I’m definitely making more of this!
3598	435	Used 4 cups very ripe pears and four cups sugar, simmered for 2 hours, turned out perfect. I would definitely cut the sugar down by half next time, though.
3599	435	I put my pear in my ninja and basically puréed them. It is not smooth like honey but it is rich and thick and color like honey. Husband says it taste good to him.
3600	435	Came out SO good that I’m going to experiment making ‘honey’ with other fruits!
3601	435	tastes just like candy...my 80 year old mother was eating it by the spoonful
3602	435	I made 4 batches and it is so good. Cooked for 3 hours. I made 2 batches at a time. I used the Pamper Chef apple peeler and it was fast. Thanks
3603	435	Before making this I read through the reviews for do's, don'ts, and adjustments others had made.
3604	436	I made this exactly as instructed. I make several butternut squash soups, and never add milk or cream to keep the calories down. But I added half and half this time, and it makes a huge difference. It is very creamy and very filling. The curry is not overpowering and the pear/ginger somehow are just enough sweetness to balance the curry, without it tasting more like a recipe that has apples and cinnamon etc. We LOVE this recipe. It is simple and now it is my favorite butternut squash soup!
3605	436	I make this soup regularly now, it's so yummy!
3606	436	Made exactly as directed - but added crumbles Italian spicy and sweet sausage at tend - AMAZING!
3607	436	Amazing recipe for main course, or as an appetizer.
3608	436	This was the best butternut squash soup I've ever made and I make that soup a lot!  the curry plus the pear.... outstanding!
3609	436	Made this soup many times and it is always different as I add the different spices mentioned in a few of the reviews. Also I put all ingredients in a slow cooker and double the recipe. So much easier. Add the coconut milk or cream at the end after the puree.
3610	436	I have tried many recipes, but this one was by far my favorite!
3611	436	Delicious! I love this soup. Healthy, filling, and delicious. Cant beat that! Great recipe! So glad I tried this one!
3612	436	I love the flavors in this recipe.  I made it exactly as described and it was delicious.  I actually tripled the batch to freeze the leftovers for later.
3613	437	One spoonful & all of my kids (5 adults) each wanted some!  Normally I like the shorter reviews but I have some information about how mine came out.  I made 2 batches, both in the crock pot with the only changes of coring & peeling the pears (soaking in salt water to prevent browning until all are peeled), 1/2 cup brown sugar, added a tsp of vanilla to help bring the flavor out & Tones' has a Cinnamon Maple Sprinkle that I added which really amped up the flavor aspect.  I used my immersion blender to blend the butter & although I left the lid off for a couple of hours, it never thickened up.  So I added 2 packages of Knox Unflavored Gelatin & turned out the perfect consistency when cooled.The second batch I did not add the water at the bottom because of the prior results & accidently forgot the orange juice.  I did add the zest near the end but didn't want to add the juice seeing how it all ready had a lot of liquid.  Again, added the unflavored gelatin to thicken it up.  The taste is slightly different but still amazing!  I will make it again next year but I may try using pectin to see the results.
3614	437	I love the flavor of this recipe and will use it again. I made it to the directions and the only change I will make is next time I will peel and core my pears, I did not care for the mashing and mess with hot fruit. I usually make my pear butter to a apple butter recipe and we love that but this is a little different.
3615	437	did not cook long enough to be a jam-it was a sauce
3616	437	Yummy ...First timer here and it work very well ....
3617	437	I made it with about 8 lbs of pears.  I make mine in the crockpot overnight or until most of liquid is  gone.  I wait until end to add sugar and add according to taste.. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Then blend with hand blender right in the crockpot for a nice smooth butter
3618	437	I cooked the pears first and put through folly mill then cooked in the crock pot for about 18 hours on low. Stirring occasionally and rotating the pot of the crock pot.  I added 2 very large cinnamon sticks  used Brown sugar and increased nutmeg.
3619	437	Put all ingredients in crock pot on low for 8 hours.Then on high for 5 hours ,stirring and mashing with potato masher hourly. when It reached the consistency I wanted I canned 2 pints and one half pint of Great Pear Butter.
3620	437	I made this last week and it has a wonderful flavor and consistency.  I did replace the OJ with pineapple juice because I had it from the Pear Honey recipe on this site.  I used my CrockPot as others had suggested and it worked...BUT when I started to clean the crock, I discovered it had a couple of hairline fractures.  I contacted the company, CrockPot, and was told the pot must be 2/3 to 3/4 full or the heat can buildup and result in cracks in the crock or the lid.  I did take the lid off for the last 2 or 3 hours to allow the moisture to evaporate.  So, just a word of warning to those using a slow cooker.
3621	437	Good but way too sweet when I make this again i will reduce sugar.  I was also out of nutmeg so used apple pie spice with excellent results.
3622	438	Excellent sandwich, very tasty.
3623	438	I made this EXACTLY as Chef John directed. Simply amazing. I will definitely make it again.
3624	438	I made this the other night for the family. They are not picky eaters but this is a strange but wonderful combination and we all enjoyed this recipe. I even went way out of my way to purchase some bakery sourdough bread. I will make this again for sure.
3625	438	More brie!
3626	438	It was delicious, quick and easy to prep. and very, very easy to eat with an arugula salad on the side, sabrosisimo.
3627	438	Yep, I'll make it again
3628	438	Awesome! I spread some fig preserves to the bread and some lingonberry jam on top of the cheese! AWESOME! Next time, i'll add some cooked bacon!
3629	438	Delicious!! If you can't find Brie cheese at your local grocery store, try the spreadable Crème de Brie...still makes for a great sandwich!
3630	438	I quite liked this fancier twist on a grilled cheese. Due to dietary problems, I used brie instead of the recommended bread. It was tasty, and the pears were delicious with the brie. However, it's not a recipe I would make frequently. It's a nice twist on the original, but I felt like it was a bit too fancy and savory to eat on a regular basis. Every once in a while, though, it would be a delicious treat.
3631	439	For me this was way too much vinegar. It didn't thicken very much.
3632	439	I added celery seed 1 tsp.  Wonderful relish over red beans!
3633	439	Only lengthy part is prep time, peeling the pears.  Once that was done it went smoothly from there and it was very tasty.
3634	439	We ate this with chips like salsa. Gone in no time!
3635	439	Amazing! We put this stuff on everything! New favorite is on top of Brie softened in the oven for a bit. Serve with crackers or really just use a spoon!
3636	439	My Memaw (dad's mom) made a variation of this. She always just called it Chow Chow. She used white vinegar, but other than that this is very close. The only thing we used it on was beans and cornbread, but as an adult I have learned it goes great on ham, hot dogs, or basically anywhere you would normally put mustard.
5151	651	I actually enjoyed the heat. Rather than using as a salsa pureed it as a sauce over al pastor quesadillas. Awesome!
3637	439	I peeled and quartered the pears before cooking and used habeneros and a carolina reaper. The batch with just habs is really good. The batch with the reaper and habs is good but really hot.
3638	439	I added two additional jalapeño peppers. Taste great!
3639	439	I’m making my second batch, this is delicious my husband loved it! I’m going to use  habaneros this time. I will make every year!
3640	440	This cranberry sauce was a hit!  I will definitely make this for many of our holiday get togethers.
3641	440	I just made this and it is fantastic. I did decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple cider for the liquid.  I used dried cherries and apricots as my dried fruits, and added a cinnamon stick to the mixture as it was cooking.  I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving. A nice change from classic cranberry sauce.
3642	440	My search for the ultimate cranberry sauce ended when I tried this one a few years back--it's food fit for the gods.  For the dried fruit I use mango, pineapple, and apricots.  I thought the cinnamon taste was a bit strong so I cut that and the nutmeg, as well as the pecans in half.  As delicious as it is, it's utterly amazing mixed into some good Greek yogurt.  Can't recommend this recipe highly enough!
3643	440	I found this recipe years ago and it's becomes one of our family favorites. My kids say it's not Thanksgiving or Christmas without it! It's perfectly wonderful as written (except for the nuts), but I like to add a bit of fresh lemon juice and I also zest both the lemon and the orange. We love dried cherry craisins for the dried fruit.
3644	440	A new family tradition
3645	440	This is an easy recipe to follow. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to give some away as gifts. Easy to make and place in jars with a bath canner for 15’. I tried some while warm and it was great. Not to sweet and nit to tart. The only issue I have was once it cooled the orange flavor was obsolete and the cinnamon flavor was powerful. I even decreased my cinnamon and added an extra orange with orange extract so I’m not sure what happened. I usually make another recipe but this one sounded so good. It is better as far as sweetness. It was a great addition to my sliced turkey sandwich that I had for lunch and it’s great on oatmeal!  We’ve also used it as jam on our toast and pancakes!  Thank you for posting. Easy peasy and great gift idea during the holidays.
3646	440	Turned out fabulous !  Will make it a traditional recipe every year!
3647	440	Love this recipe! Skip the nuts.
3648	440	This was good, but it is more of a salad instead of a sauce.  I ended up adding a container of cool whip and marshmallows.  I made "Holiday Cranberry Sauce" at the same time to compare the two recipes.  I prefer the Holiday Cranberry Sauce.
3649	441	The flavors in this are really nice - exactly the treatment of pears and blue cheese (I used a good Stilton) I was craving.   The dressing is a nice balance of sweet and vinegar, but there was too much of it.  The salad was a bit drowned for my family's taste.  I'll cut the dressing in half when I next prepare this.
3650	441	The dressing is one the best things I have ever tasted!
3651	441	Delicious
3652	441	I make this recipe just as is. It is my absolute favorite! I double the dressing and only pour the dressing on individual servings. I want plenty of left over dressing to use in the future. ( You can’t use poppyseed dressing and give this three stars. )
3653	441	This is one of my favorite salads. I love the candied pecans and the blue cheese with the pears. The blend of flavors is incredible.
3654	441	Loved this salad. The idea of the mayo was off putting to me  at first but all the flavors complimented each other very well. Didn't have walnut oil so used avocado oil instead. I imagine this definitely changed the flavor of the salad overall but we were pleased with the end result.
3655	441	5 stars for nothing more than the delicious salad dressing.  Would I make it again? yes, but with feta.  I am not a fan of blue cheese, although my husband liked it.  To me, the blue cheese overpowered the delicious dressing.  Also, next time I may try with some orange slices and pear.  I think a little citrus flavor would enhance overall taste.
3656	441	Excellent.  Will definitely make it again.
3657	441	Great easy salad! I agree the dressing is better omitting the brown sugar. I did not have walnut oil but olive oil tasted great, too. I also used plain not candied pecans. The dressing is plenty sweet for the salad I think without the addition of candied nuts. Gonna make this again!
3658	442	yummy
3659	442	This was good.  My only problem was that you couldn't taste the pears.  I couldn't even tell they were in there.  Probably won't make again.
3660	442	USed lemon jello instead of lime.
3661	442	We liked this and will make again
3662	442	My family loves this all time favorite.  It's an old recipe which we always make around the holiday.  So easy to make, but I will warn you - you might have to coax the children to try it... once they do, they will love the taste...
3663	442	Made the recipe as written--except cut all ingredients in half for the 3 of us.  Then made changing flavors/Fruit.  It is the only way I can get my 97 year old mom to get fruit.  She loves this!
3664	442	I did not like the grainy texture.
3665	442	I served for guests and everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again.
3666	442	I was looking for something to replace our traditional lime jello with cottage cheese and pineapple ( new DIL hates cottage cheese).  This was great and loved by all.  I replaced the water with the drained pear juice and used my food processor instead of the blender.  I added a can of drained mandarin oranges to make it a little more substantial.  I think we've found a new tradition.
3667	443	I thought this salad to be delicious!  The only thing I did differently after tasting the dressing was to make a double portion, put it in a pretty jar, and allow people to add it to their own greens, knowing that it would be too bold for some.  It also kept greens crisper.  We paired with a savory chicken dish.
3668	443	Easy & Excellent!!! I added strawberries & used Feta cheese (not a blue cheese fan). We mixed with organic baby spinach,
3669	443	My husband loved it. The pears I used where a bit  unripe but that actually worked out okay. Now I got all these apples though ,
3670	443	very good!!!
3671	443	made this recipe and it was a big hit at a dinner party.so easy and the dressing was really delicious.i am making for thankgsgiving!!
3672	443	Excellent salad! My husband said it is the best he ever had!??!! I substituted the blue cheese with chunky fresh mozzerella balls cut up  and used candied pecans.. This definetly is a keeper. The salad dressing was easy and tasty complement. I also substituted the pear with an asian pear.
3673	443	This was pretty good, but really missing something.  I think the dressing needs a little sweetness to it...maybe some honey wisked into it?  We ended up using WAY more blue cheese than called for to add some more flavor.  I would suggest doubling the blue cheese, wisking some honey into the dressing, and only using tart (maybe green) apples.  We enjoyed this, but expected better.
3674	443	The dressing is amazing - my new favorite. Just served this at a dinner with grilled chicken and everyone loved it!!!
3675	443	Fabouls Well done
3676	444	I absolutely love this! My fav salad! Always at hit at parties & gatherings! Thank you!
3677	444	I did not have a pear but I made it anyway and it was excellent.  I also just used a whisk!  Less to clean...
3678	444	Forget the lettuce. Yum.
3679	444	So delicious!!! My family loved everything about it and they’re usually not salad people. For Christmas I added pomegranates and it looked extra festive. Definitely a keeper!
3680	444	My favorite salad but I prefer salads with fruit.  I made it exactly as written.  I've served it at dinner parties and everyone wants the recipe.
3681	444	Made this salad tonight. It was so good.
3682	444	I made this exactly as written except substituted 1/2 of the lemon with apple cider vinegar because my husband is not a huge lemon fan.  Everyone who ate it claimed it to be their new favorite salad!  Honestly, the cashews, Swiss cheese, fruit and dressing were outrageously delicious!  Try it!
3683	444	Didn’t have cranberries, it was still great.
3684	444	I used my favorite pre-made poppyseed dressing, but would like to try this dressing from scratch at some point.
3685	445	I made this pizza for a potluck party on a homemade crust, topped with arugula (rather than chives) - it was a hit!! I also brushed the crust with avocado oil and fresh chopped garlic.  Such a good blend of flavors. I can’t wait to make it again!
3686	445	This recipe is easy, quick, and excellent. I thought about adding dried cranberries on top for it different kick, but haven’t done it just yet.
3687	445	So friggin good!  I pre-baked the crust to give it structure to support the weight. After pre-baking the crust for 5 mins, I drizzled a little olive oil on the crust before adding ingredients. I followed the layering exactly except instead of green onions, I added fresh arugula once the pizza was finished baking.
3688	445	Delicious!
3689	445	Wow is this good!
3690	445	This was my favorite pizza at CPK! I was so disappointed when they removed it from their menu.I used Green Giant -cauliflower pizza crust in Tuscan flavor which provided a thin, crunchy crust and took a few pointers from others like pre-baking the crust before adding toppings, swiping olive oil and garlic over the crust and adding additional gorgonzola and caramelized onions.  Super easy- I will definitely make this again!
3691	445	I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and fast! Served with a salad and dinner was done.
3692	445	exccellent. Never could figure out what to do with those rock hard Anjou pears!
3693	445	I did not measure the amount of gorgonzola  and  probably used too much.  Pizza was pungent but good anyway.  The pear  slices were also too thin so their flavor was lost.   I made the pizza dough from Cuisinart recipe.
3694	446	Perfect! Thank you for sharing. I didn’t use the exact ratio of apples to pears - I use what I had in hand 8 apples & 3 pears. Yummy!
3695	446	Left the recipe chunky, did not turn into sauce.
3696	446	I love this recipe.  I have never had 4 pears but 2 pears and 4 apples work.  It is so easy and I have it on my porridge in the morning.  One day I may actually have the right amount of pears and have a whole different taste sensation.
3697	446	I have made this three times now and have not been disappointed!  This has become a family favorite.  I love it with the red Anjou pears and almost any apples.  I have again put in the pineapple juice instead of water and again used the cherry concentrate.  Not a lot of the cherry flavoring; go easy.  This batch was a bit chunkier.  All a matter of how you mash/grind.  It is great how you can taste all those flavors even the bit of cherry.  The kids love it.  I never put in extra cinnamon but the ¼ teaspoon is nice.  This is a family keeper.  I have even frozen some.  Thank you!
3698	446	made this recipe for my 20 month old son and he absolutely loves it. hes working on his second bowl of it right now
3699	446	This turned out amazing. I used 5 red apples, 5 pears, a cinnamon stick, a pinch of salt and a little powdered cinnamon as well. Turned out perfectly sweet.
3700	446	I followed the recipe exactly, happy to have done so. It turned out to be delicious and super simple. A great side dish for most any. Meal.
3701	446	Awesome!! The recipe isn’t very big so I tripled it lol came out amazing!!!!! Cool time is wonky for a tripled batch because I had to use a pot instead of skillet but still amazing!!
3702	446	I made it as directed and was surprised at how well I like it. Hubby was loving it too!  Thanks for the recipe...………...
3703	447	Made on Cauliflower pizza crust. Fam loved it.
3704	447	we did. used gorgonzola, substitute Mexican cheese for mozzarella, added one handfull of spinach chopped, used 1/4 cup olive oil and used roll out pie crust, sprinkled light mex cheese to adhere walnuts, then baked
3705	447	I use my own crust but follow the rest of the recipe. I've made this many times for many people and it has always been a success. Even people who say they don't like pears have loved it!
3706	447	Great blue cheese flavor in this pizza, blended wonderfully with the pears and walnuts. I might use less of the vinaigrette sauce next time as some people thought it was a bit overpowering. We made our own pizza crust instead of using a store-bought one and we used dried hens instead of fresh ones.
3707	447	We enjoyed this in spite of the fact that the pears I used did not have a ton of flavor.  This would make a really nice party appetizer, cut into small wedges.  From a presentation point of view, the pear slices looked a little dry when this came out of the oven.  Next time I think I'll try heating a little bit of apple jelly and brushing it on the fruit before it goes into the oven.  For whatever reason, the crust ended up tough/too chewy...I used a Boboli thin pizza crust.  In the future, I think I'll use my own homemade pizza crust.  This is very rich, the vinaigrette has a wonderful herb-garlic-blue cheese flavor, and it was dinner last night with a big tossed salad.  IMO this is best served warm.  Thanks M.J.W. for a new recipe that definitely is "outside the box."
3795	457	I decided to add a coconut pecan frosting to the  prune cake. I remembered that is how my mom use to make hers when I was a young girl. Served it to my family today and they were crazy over it. I think I will be baking a few cakes for Christmas gifts.
3708	447	Ok, rating again because this time I made it with fresh rosemary, cut it into small pieces and served as an appetizer at a friend's birthday party - rave reviews. PLUS - I used the leftover sauce this way: I sauteed some chicken thighs in olive oil (salt and peppered it first). I had 1/2 bunch of swiss chard to use up so I chopped it finely and threw that in while cooking the chicken. When chicken was browned on both sides, I added in the leftover sauce that I didn't use on the pizza. I had two ripe pears to use up so I peeled those, chopped and threw them in too. Cooked until chicken was almost falling apart, maybe 40 mins. Served it over jasmine rice. YUM!
3709	447	best. pizza. ever. made. it was amazing! and so easy. I really enjoyed making this pizza. I used ww dough i made in the bread machine and substituted feta for blue cheese because its what I had on hand, and threw in a green onion instead of rosemary. But other than that followed the recipe and really enjoyed this pizza.
3710	447	Too much mustard. I topped the pizza with chopped fresh spinach. Next time I'll use more garlic.
3711	447	Wow! This pizza was so delicious! I don't used pre-baked crust, I use the fresh dough from the local supermarket. This pizza turned out very well. The flavor combinations were spot on. I substituted toasted walnuts with candied walnuts because that's what I had. Still amazing. The sauce loses a little bit of flavor once cooked, but you can always add a little more once the pizza is cooked. Mmmmm.
3712	448	Loved these, so simple and elegant.  Perfect with a bit of homemade ice cream and love that the pear syrup can be used to make cocktails.
3713	448	I didn’t do it quite right, and so the pears were still a bit hard when we ate them, but I really like it. I wish the recipe used the actual name though—Poire Belle Hélène
3714	448	This is a gorgeous, flavourful dessert! It's also easy to prepare ahead of time so you aren't rushed.
3715	448	super easy & delish! ...and I don't even like fruit desert, usually.
3716	448	Excellent! I brought them to a dinner party and everyone loved them. I used only 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty.
3717	448	Your method of removing seeds wastes fruit. I sliced ready to eat pear lengthwise and easily removed seeds AND stem.
3718	448	This was so delicious! Very sweet! I might cut back on the sugar next time and see what the difference is. I added two extra cups of water and a few extra pears. Didn’t seem to change the recipe at all. The recipe is easy to follow and wonderful! I just melted chocolate chips to use for the chocolate. Soooooo good!!!
3719	448	Adorable video!
3720	448	Easy, delicious no brainer!
3721	449	I made some strawberry syrup with some fresh strawberries and didn't want to just throw out the left over strawberry mash and then I saw this recipe. It came out really nice but I wasn't able to roll it very well. Even if it didn't have the consistency results I hoped for, I still loved the flavors and it was still the same chewy texture I hoped for.
3722	449	So delicious! I used asian Apple pears from my tree and omitted the sugar since those are super sweet. I boiled them first- skin and cores minus the stems. Then I threw it all into the Vitamix blender with a handful of raspberries for color- which really augmented the taste considerably... so I made sure to do that again the second time around as well.
3723	449	This is a good recipe, but I use a food mill, and have apple puree, which is great.  I also like to add different flavored extracts to have different flavors, which helps to not add too much sugar.  Honey is also a great alternative, and adds a unique flavor to the leathers.  I also use a dehydrator, it is much easier than an oven if you happen to have one, and they are fairly inexpensive to purchase.  But this is a great recipe to start with.
3724	449	I tried the honey with 1/2 cup sugar!  Tastes awesome, but doesn't have the consistency of leather.  Probably my fault, I should have blended better.
3725	449	Great recipe! I didn't have apples and just used pears. I didn't spread out over the sheet and it took longer, longer than 6 hours, I did let it cool over night in the oven, but turned out great! Oh! I used parchment paper with some Pam spray for just in case stickiness. It tasted great.
3726	449	I have made this a few of times and the kids love it! I blend my fruit in my Ninja until it looks like Applesauce, then ad the rest of the ingredients, taste it and ad Sugar accordingly, then  throw it in the oven.  Mine seems to cook forever though. My oven only goes down to 170 and so at first I kept the door cracked and watched over it for more than 16hrs. The last times I left it at 170 with the door closed and it takes about 10-12hrs. Turns out perfect!
3727	449	My kids LOVE these and will not touch the store bought ones now, which makes me very happy as a mommy! I NEVER put sugar in these, however I will add a little bit of honey to taste, depending on what fruits we are using. This weekend we made strawberry/blackberry mix together, And My kids along with my husband were eating them before I could get them rolled!
3728	449	I did this with VERY ripe pears so I used about half the sugar.  I did use my vitamix and it does make it easier.  It's not really necessary to peel the fruit, but you do need to remove the seeds, especially apple seeds as they are pretty toxic.  My 19 month old grandson loved it.  His Mommy liked it too!  At first I was unhappy because I didn't get it super evenly spread, but the edges got a little cripsy while the middle was chewy.  It was two foods in one, fruit leather and fruit chips!  Thanks for the recipe!!!
3729	449	I tried this recipe with strawberries and raspberries and it was not good. May be I should have used different fruit and added more sugar, but it took nineteen hours to dry the fruit and it was not good. I'd rather buy the fruit roll ups in the store. I usually love the recipes from this web site.
3730	450	Took to a potluck and got rave reviews. I substituted feta for the Havarti and toasted pecans for almonds but otherwise the same. Nice combination.
3731	450	Great salad and easy to pull together. My guests loved it and it was great for a winter salad.
3732	450	Loved this salad! I loved the different tastes and textures. Served it with burgers, light and delicious.
3733	450	Very good and quick to prepare. A few changes are needed to make it a little better. It has way too much garlic for my taste. I would cut it to about 1/3 of what's called for. The dressing needs more brown sugar to add a little more sweetness. Will definitely make it again.
3734	450	liked this a lot
3735	450	We made half the dressing and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 teaspoon. So good. We were happy to find this recipe. Tonight we’re using lettuce from our garden and pears from our tree. This recipe is on our list!
3797	459	When I put the batter in the pan, it was insufficient to cover the bottom of the pan, so I quickly made another recipe of batter to add on top. It took almost twice as long to bake, but was wonderful! 10/10!! Love it!
3736	450	This salad rocks! No need to change a thing! If anything double the mustard vinaigrette because people can’t get enough of it! My family says they want it at least once a week or they’re going to throw a fit. Simply a delicious salad that you can’t put down. I made some the next day and chopped up grilled chicken breast from the night before and it was a meal in itself.
3737	450	Great salad and one I will make again. I was fortunate to have pear basalmic  vinegar in the cupboard which was an added bonus.
3738	450	I used blue cheese crumbles, green onion, no sliced almonds instead of the cheese listed and spinach for greens.
3739	267	I liked the simplicity in making it. Just cut up the my favorite fruit that I had in the refrigerator. I used the suggested amount of each fruit. I think the honey and lemon juice topped it off.
3740	267	Didn’t have all of the fruits, so substituted several things.  I did have the watermelon, blackberries, strawberries.  What makes this work is the dressing and the mint.  It was wonderful.  If you don’t have all of the fruits, no worries - put what you have in there.  Keep the dressing and mint the same.  I loved it and will definitely make again.
3741	267	The mint was nice for a change from the traditional fruit salad.  Not a replacement of the traditional recipe but adds a tasty option.
3742	267	A great, colorful fruit salad.  I used Honeydew instead of Watermelon.  I left out the peaches since the white peaches i bought we too hard.  I added 2 Kiwi and used a full lemon's zest.  Finally I added a champagne mango.  The whole salad was enjoyed at a brunch today with 13 people.  Will do this again!
3743	267	Oh no! This was perfect ! My family loved it. Definitely will make it more often & for other occasions.
3744	267	I changed up the fruit (used watermelon, blueberries, honeydew melon, strawberries and white peaches), made the dressing as written using mint from our garden, and this was a hit at dinner! Delicious
3745	267	I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.   Especially good during this hot season.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.
3746	267	You select your favorite fruits. the flavor is really brought together by the syrup. I used watermelon, pineapple, strawberries, and blackberries. I mixed residual watermelon juice  with the syrup and it gave a wonderful flavor. Super refreshing. It was a hit at the dinner party.
3747	267	I didn't use the same combination of fruits. I had watermellow, strawberries, blueberries and pineapple. It was fine, we took it to a summer block party and it vanished. Everyone liked the honey lemon and mint dressing.
3748	452	Very nice but I sauté some diced pancetta  and then sauté the cubed pear in with the pancetta just before the pancetta is done.
3749	452	Loved this!! I used almonds instead of walnuts as I didn’t have any. Current favourite meal!
3750	452	I made this tonight for the family but added  chicken (finely cubed and fried in olive oil).  I also went heavy on the Gorgonzola and Parmesan to bump up the flavor, and I sauteed the pears to soften them a bit.  I wanted more pear flavor so next time I'll use more pear and cube them to a larger size.
3751	452	I took the recipe and ran away with it. I doubled the butter and added spinach and prosciutto, everything I kept the same. So yummy
3752	452	So good!!! I made it just the way the recipe said. Sweet!!
3753	452	Yummy and nutritious!
3754	452	Although I rarle rate recipes, this one is WORTH it - served mostly as is, but added Tbsp. extra cream and Gorgonzola. Serve with a well seasoned steak and lemon peas or pea pods for maximum flavor... KUDOS,
3755	452	Delicious!  My husband and I both loved it and he said it was gourmet quality...on top of all that, it was easy.  I did use a little more cheese and pear than the recipe called for, but it would have been great without it.  Thanks for sharing!
3756	452	So delicious- I'm never buying canned already sauce again.  This was so easy to make and the taste phenomenal!  Even better than many restaurant pastas I've had.  Will make this over and over again.
3757	453	I tried a few different recipes for Duck Sauce.  BY FAR, this was the greatest! The others were way too bitter.  It has the consistency of applesauce (after well blended) just like the Duck Sauce in our local Chinese Restaurants in New England! yum!
3758	453	made this, haven't used it in anything yet, but it tastes good! i made a big change though: i left out the sugar and used water instead of apple juice. and it's just fine. i added a bit more of the apricot preserves and that was sugar free too.
3759	453	Very good sauce that I made with my first ever roasted duck from this site. Delicious, thanks for the recipe
3760	453	This was the first time I cooked duck and was rather pleased with how it turned out. A lot of people told me duck was greasy (which it is) but this sauce counteracts the greasiness and compliments the flavour of the meat quite nicely. The flavour of the sauce is influenced by the fruit used - tart apples and under-ripe plums made it pleasantly tangy.
3761	453	This is excellent! I omitted the apple juice and used only plums. WOW. Great on rice, pasta. meat dishes. We love it! THANKS!
3762	453	I reduced this Chinese Duk Sauce recipe to fewer servings so that I could compare it with my much more traditional recipe, which takes fewer ingredients. Thanks for posting this recipe, but I will continue making my recipe.
3763	453	This recipe tastes really good :)
3764	454	I love plum pudding & I must say this is one of the best recipes I have found. Thank you for sharing yours :)
3765	454	The flavor of the pudding was good when I tasted the batter, but I steamed the pudding for 9.5 hrs, checked it, and it was very dark and the entire outside of the pudding seems burnt. I have never burnt anything while steaming before and didn't even know that was possible. :(
3766	454	I made this one last year, I found it very much to my taste, but my children and family found it too nutty. . .
3767	454	I presented this pudding at the Christmas dinner table last year and my family were amazed - to this day the think I'm a culinary genius!
3768	454	Just the recipe I wanted!
3796	458	I have made all of my own baby food for all of our children, this is a great tutorial for new moms wanting to make their own healthy homemade baby food. If the plum mixture is to thin you can thicken it up with some cereal or thin it out with formula, breast milk or the cooking water  (the cooking water has some vitamins & nutrients which get leached out during steaming). As baby gets older  I add in some spices such as; cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, etc.
6189	783	thought it was easy to make and tasted great - the salsa was really good - makes the meal
3769	455	“All purpose baking mix” is a new one to me and I looked it up and found several recipes with such a variety of ingredients so I kind of combined the main aspects : flour, baking powder, milk (used oat milk), some avocado oil in place of shortening and about 1/3 cup of egg whites because I thought it would make the topping a little lighter. I cut up the plums when they were almost done with the first bake because they were just too large to be useful. I also broke the dough up into smaller pieces and laid them around rather than spoon drops, but followed the time and temp directions exactly.If I make this again, I’d use less sugar with the plums and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon sugar on the top before baking with the dough.It tastes really good, though. One star off because I’ll never be able to recreate the “baking mix” I used.
3770	455	Great recipe And the only change that I made was to remove most of the peels after cooking the plums
3771	455	Awesome and delicious!!
3772	455	Used full amount of sugar and also added half a can of peaches in juice because I love the combined flavors
3773	455	I've made it twice! Easy and delicious! I used prune plums fresh from my sisters tree. They are smaller but so much sweeter than store bought. I used extra the second time; maybe 25 -30 plums.
3774	455	This was o.k. as written, but I made some changes that I thought made it much better, although it may have to do with what type of plums you use.  I used red plums right off the tree, and they are very juicy, so I left out the water.  I also doubled the amount of plums and cut the dough in half.  I cooked the plums a little longer, until they were bubbling all the way through. The first time I made it as written, and there was too much dough and not enough of the plum. With the changes I would give it five stars.
3775	455	It's really nice!  Great use of plums and I have a tree.
3776	455	I had some plums that were getting too ripe. I used them in this recipe to make the plum pudding.  The plums that I used were about 3 inches in diameter. I used red plums.  I followed the directions on the recipe and made some adjustments as were suggested in some of the reviews.  I cut back on the sugar when cooking the plums with the tapioca.  After it was cooked, I tasted the juice and thought it needed a bit more sugar.  In all I probably used 3/4 cup of sugar in the plum mixture.  The plums that I had were quite tart and may have been the reason I felt like it needed more sugar.
3777	455	I've never had (or made) plum pudding before, and this was excellent, and easy!
3778	456	Changed it up abit to cut sugar, sodium and fat.  I used  1 c. frozen plums cut up ( not drained),  1/3 c raisins with the 1 Tbsp. flour and for Wet Ingredients  used 2 eggs, 1/3 c oil, 1/3 c brown sugar,  ( will use honey next time), vanilla.  For Dry , I used  1 c. all purp flour and 1/2 whole wheat, 1 tsp b. powder, 1/4 b. soda. I used 1/3 c vanilla yogurt, topped off the loaf with walnuts,  and baked in my toaster oven covering it for last  minutes.  I found my loaf really moist , maybe too moist , so will cut by 1 egg. or drain my frozen plums. I love it and sweet enough for me.
3779	456	Keeper recipe!I doubled vanilla and baking soda, halfed the white sugar.It's moist, sweet and a bit tart with the sugar cut down, SO tasty!
3780	456	Tasty recipe.  I made a double recipe with butter and sour cream as they were on hand.  I also omitted about a half cup of the sugar and I only used 1/8 cup of brown sugar for the topping on each loaf.
3781	456	Loved it - great crunchy top, light and tasty.  I used 1 1/2 slightly heaped cups of plums.  1/2 tsp baking soda as some suggested and I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon (Vietnamese Penzy brand).  I only had coconut yogurt which is runnier so it took much longer to bake so will use thicker Greek yogurt next time.  Excellent though and not overly sweet!
3782	456	Very moist!! I used vanilla yogurt because that is what I had and exactly 1 cup of peeled, diced plums. Added a dash of cinnamon and a few pieces of pecans on top. I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda. They rose beautifully. This recipe made enough for 4 mini loaves. In my Emeril oven on the bake setting at 375F they took 20 minutes to cook. Perfect for summer when you don’t need a hot kitchen!
3783	456	Excellent recipe!  I used 1.5 cups of plums and it was just right.  The sugar sprinkled on the top is a great idea.
3784	456	This came out so nice! Real easy to make. I used vanilla yogurt though, and added ground cinnamon.  Definitely going to make this again
3785	456	This was SO good! My boyfriend made it with the red plums from our organic box. I was surprised at how good it was! He did use real butter instead of margarine, reduced the white sugar by 1/4 cup, and forgot to top it with the  brown sugar. It was amazing! Definitely a keeper!
3786	456	This is a fantastic recipe! I made three mini loaves.  Used 2 cups of plums because I had to use up lots, and it was the perfect amount.  I did increase the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon as 1/4 didn't seem like enough.  Didn't bother with the sugar on top as they were plenty sweet. Will definitely make this again.
3787	457	This was my childhood favorite that my mom made. The only thing different, she would make the cake in a 9X13. She would take a fork and poke holes before pouring the glaze over it. The older it got the moisturer it got. Although they didn’t last too long with us. I was so afraid I would not find this recipe as she has past away and the recipe is quit warn. Can’t wait to make this.
3788	457	It was anything but moist! Would not try again what a waste of time and energy
3789	457	This is delicious. Only problem I had was the glaze. Seemed like too much. It was all over the plate even though I kept spooning it on top. It didn't seem to soak in as much as I thought it should.. definitely a keeper but I will use a different glaze recipe next time that doesn't make so much.
3790	457	I didn't find this cake troublesome at all - it easily accomplished by a novice cook.   That being said, I wasn't impressed.  I thought with all the positive reviews I would love it, but it's not that spicy and it's WAY too sweet.  It has a very bland flavor profile.  Will not be making it again.  Many other great spice cake recipes out there that are so much better.  A good one to try is  America's Test Kitchen's recipe for Gingerbread Layer Cake (you can make it in a bundt pan easily) - it's WONDERFUL.  Much more complex and flavorful.  Won't help you use up that bag of prunes, but great nonetheless!
3791	457	Very similar to my Mom's recipe, which she got from an Italian lady whom my family was great friends with.  In fact I often called her my second Momma growing up.  I make this only once a year so needed a reminder of the spice amounts,  when I couldn't find Mom's recipe this year I came here.  A couple of adjustments and it is the same as my family's.
3792	457	I've been making these for years and years. My mother used to make them for me my entire life. I lost my recipe and I found this and it's exactly like the one we've had. Thank you for sharing this
3793	457	Very rich and moist cake.it was just like mom used to make.
3798	460	Extremely great!!!! I made sure to get the correct vodka amount and follow the recipe perfectly except that I was worried that the fermentation container would bust on its side so I sat it up to relieve pressure. Tastes amazing and I made 4 liters of plum liquor. Can’t taste the vodka at all but definitely get a nice smooth vanilla-y taste !!!
3799	460	I made this recipe following the instructions exactly. I also made another batch with less sugar. I did not use wax to seal the jars--I used regular mason jar lids, and I stored the jars in a cool dark place, shaking every week or so to combine ingredients. The results were very good. We enjoyed the lower sugar batch more than the full sugar one. The low sugar liqueur was plummier. I think the syrupy batch would make a good topping for dessert.
3800	460	Mine came out on the sweet side.  I'm not sure if this is due to the type of plums I used or the amount of sugar in this recipe.  Guess I'll have to try again next year ;).  Very good in plumtinis.
3801	460	This came out really delicious!  The vanilla flavor and the sugar make it really sweet so much that the vodka taste almost disappears.
3802	461	Love this recipe! The pie came out perfect! I did substitute butter partly to coconut oil. Plums were a bit tart but I prefer it this way. Will be making this again many times!
3803	461	Outstanding will make it again and again
3804	461	I don't understand how not more people have brought up the major issue with the recipe: the SWEETNESS. It is a major sugar overload.  Almost a cup in the dough, another cup in the filling with the already-sweet plums, and another quarter cup for the crumb topping. It was so insanely sweet I actually had to manually remove the filling and rinse it out to make the pie actually edible. Once I did that I suppose it was okay. I recommend halfing the overall sugar that is called for here, if not also omitting the crumb topping.
3805	461	Really disappointed. There was so much liquid in the pie after baking that it just fell apart when trying to serve. Maybe I used the wrong plums?! Recipe didn’t specify and the store only had one kind. I think the flavor was good, but didn’t love it enough to try this one again :(
3806	461	We have what I call a “rotten fruit stand” by our house. They sell all kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables. We picked up a couple of Fairy Tale pumpkins on the last trip. My wife likes to pick through the $1 baskets of over ripe or bad fruits and vegetables. The plums came from there.
3807	461	This was delicious!  I had not made a plum pie before so decided why not. Let’s just say I will be making this again.  Soon
3808	461	+blueberries
3809	461	I made this with one change walnuts in place of Hazelnuts.  It was a tasty pie, I liked the strussle topping and filling but was not a fan of the crust. I will make this again but use a regular pie crust. Great use for our bummer crop of plums.
3810	461	Worked amazing thank you
3811	462	The cake is yummy, not too sweet. Next time i will add a little bit jam on the top.
3812	462	Great recipe. Easy to follow. Added brown sugar on top as some suggested. For a sauce on the bottom heated chopped plums, butter, sugar, dark rum and a bit of vanilla until it bubbles and thickened, delicious. Also tried recipe with thinly sliced pears, fabulous. Am going to try blueberries next!
3813	462	I puréed 2 plums and added it to the batter, so that there would a plum taste in the cake as well.
3814	462	I should have add more plums but it tastes good.
3815	462	Tasty, but dry.
3816	462	Thank you for sharing. It turned out very good. I did change some things. Will let you know next time I make it.
3817	462	Just planted a plum tree a couple of years ago so now on the search for recipes.  This one is a hit with family and friends.  Like that it is not too sweet.  Will make it again.
3818	462	Love the cake.  Lightly sweet and airy.  Could use any fresh fruit with this recipe.  Used an 8 in x 6 in ceramic cake pan instead of a tube pan.  Added 1 Tbsp vanilla instead of lemon zest.  Also, sprinkled sugar on the bottom of the cake pan and on top of the cake before baking.  Turned out perfectly.
3819	462	As is this tart is tasty at 3 1/2 stars, but the crust needed something.  After making it a second time with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and cardamom and 1 teaspoon vanilla, the flavor was so much better.  The cardamom with the plum was prefect.  I also sliced the plums much thinner and laid them in a rosette around the top.
3820	463	its the best i loved it
3821	463	My cupboards were shy on shallots and balsamic vinegar, so I substituted garlic an white.
3822	463	I came here looking for a nice summery dish and this did not disappoint! The salty and sweetness of this meal was great, and while it seemed maybe a little complicated before I started, it was actually incredibly easy to make! Will certainly be revisiting this one.
3823	463	This was an awesome dinner!  I didn’t think I would like the baked plums but they were very good!  I made it with no changes and will make it again!
3824	463	no thank you
3825	463	I made it and my husband enjoyed it. I'm usually hesitant to try new recipes because my husband is a picky eater, but he really liked this one!  I added a little ginger and brown sugar as my plums weren't sweet enough.  So yummy!
3826	463	This is the first pork tenderloin I thought was really juicy and delicious. Searing is key plus I watched it closely.....was done to 140’ on my thermometer in 13 minutes. I tent it with foil when it’s out of the oven and let it rest for  6 minutes. Temperature rises to 145’. The plum sauce was delicious. It didn’t look much like sliced plums after cooking but it did make a great textured sauce. I’ll be making this again. Great for company.
3827	463	Used more balsamic vinegar. But the thing that takes it over the top is to wrap your pork loin in bacon. My butcher does that for us. Incredible.
3828	463	Delicious!!  Added 1 extra tablespoon of Balsamic as other suggested and extra thyme.  Roasted the meat for 14 minutes.
3829	464	It was delicious but just a tad too sweet for me. Next time I’ll add less sugar.
3830	464	Other than a thickish topping, we all agreed that this dish was delicious as is written in the recipe and devoured 1/2 the pan!!  I think, going forward, we'll keep the recipe the same and just put down some topping before the plums and then finish with the rest of the topping.  So so so good!!
3831	464	This is absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe & cut extra pieces in squares, and froze them in Tupperware. Great recipe. Thank you!
3832	464	Just like grandma used to make! I only used about 1/3 of the topping mix though.
4212	519	i added finely chopped celery, diced apple  and some orange marmalade,  It was better than what i normally buy from the deli and way less expensive.
3833	464	Dad approved! Passed the "as good as Grandma test". I added 4 tab of ricotta instead of sour cream as some suggested. Also added lemon zest to the batter. Left out the cinnamon as I don't recall Grandma's having any. Good tip from another post regarding when it's done...look for the edges.
3834	464	This is my go to recipe for plum cake but there is definitely waaaaaay too much topping. I halve the topping ingredients and it’s still too much for a 12inch springform pan sized cake.
3835	464	Great recipe, but I did make two alterations: I added about a third cup mayonnaise (richer than sour cream) to the batter and used cardamom instead of cinnamon. Came out excellent.
3836	464	I used an 8x8 pan. I also added a bit more melted butter (a 4th tablespoon, maybe) to the topping, since it seemed so powdery. I don't know what italian plums are. My plums were about the size of a golf ball and were a bit on the sour and watery side, which is why I looked for a recipe to use them in. Turned out great--great mix of tart and sweet, and great with coffee or milk.
3837	464	I, too, found that the topping just sat on top and after 35 minutes baking it was still white flour sitting on top.  I poured some melted butter on it and baked another 30 minutes.  I will leave the topping off next time.
3838	465	4.9.20  Followed the recipe, but I did cut back the sugar because we’re just not into too sweet these days (that’s personal taste).  The recipe doesn’t tell you this, but after you add the flour and vanilla, you need to cook for about another 10 minutes or so low temp to thicken this into a sauce, otherwise you’ll have something that is the consistency of milk. I ended up adding more flour to thicken it a bit.  Also, take a few spoonfuls of the sauce and put it in a small bowl before you add the flour/vanilla.  Add the flour/vanilla, stir it well, and then add back to the sauce,  Otherwise if you add the flour directly to the hot milk-sugar-egg mixture without tempering it, you’ll end up with lumpy sauce.  The flavor is excellent, and I can see this on so many desserts, particularly bread pudding.  We enjoyed a drizzle of it on a slice of apple pie.
3839	465	The recipe was easy to make.  I was hesitant at first but by the time I started stirring and tasting, even Gordon Ramsey would have complemented me.  Outstanding over my Rum Cake.
3840	465	Yum, this was perfect!  It made my cinnamon raisin bread pudding taste like cinnamon rolls.  I used cornstarch in place of flour, it turned out great!
3841	465	fantastic! i double it and put it on my bread pudding. very yummy!
3842	465	Simple and elegant sauce. Goes great with virtually any dessert.
3843	465	I used it with rice pudding and bread pudding--excellent!!
3844	465	I would like to thank Liz. My family has been using this recipe for years.
3845	466	Deeeeeelicious. Didn't change a thing!
3846	466	So very easy and delicious! My plums were fresh from a neighbor’s tree and a bit tart, so don’t skip the confectioner’s sugar! Would work with just about any fruit, I think.
3847	466	Delicious. I actually missed putting in the remaining 2 Tblsp of sugar in the custard part and it was still sweet enough. Topped it with a bit of fresh whipped cream. Everyone loved it.
3848	466	Delicious, not-too-sweet dessert.  We didn't have lemon zest and subbed in soy milk.  Served with a bit of whipping cream.  Will definitely make again.
3849	466	This was really good.  My plums were very ripe, I sprinkled them with 1 tbsp. sugar in the pan and used half the sugar in the batter.
3850	466	This recipe is so easy and delicious.  My family loved it.  I didn’t have any lemons for lemon zest but I did have a small orange so I added orange zest instead and it was delicious.
3851	466	It was ok, a bit of a weird texture, kind of rubbery. Won’t make again,
3852	466	I made the recipe as it was. It came out great. It was quick to make, and I had lots of plums. The only thing I left out was the confectioners' sugar on top.  It doesn't need it, and I don't like confectioners' sugar dusted on stuff.  Will definitely make again.
3853	466	This was stellar! I used regular plums (I'm assuming Italian prune style plums are smaller?) and only got 7 of them into a 10" pan, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. I'd recommend a sheet pan under your pan, mine dripped all over the bottom of my oven. Worth it!
3854	467	We call this Ham Jam in our house because it is awesome as a ham glaze or condiment. If you can catch them in stores (or if you have a tree), Damson plums are especially good for ham glaze.  I don’t have a tree and it seems like they are only ever in our market for a couple days.  Anyway, this is great!
3855	467	Very good, sweet with a slightly tartness. 10/10 Sept 13, 2020
3856	468	I had a friend in the kitchen helping me and i rushed so I didn’t read the partMix flour and backing powder and saltso after everything was done and the cake was ready to be put in the oven my friend said will it be soft and I said yeah…… No because I didn’t put baking powder so I scooped the batter out carefully avoiding the fruit especially blueberries and gently mixing a little bit of flower with baking powder then mix it with the rest of the batter and placed it all back in on top of the fruit that extra dough without baking powder might make amazing difference who knows Love thanks for the recipe
3857	468	My whole family loved this cake and now rate it as our #1 blueberry dessert!  I made it just as written but added pecans to the topping for a delicious crunch!  We picked and froze quarts of our own Vermont blueberries this summer so will enjoy this year round!  But I also want to try it with peaches.  Wonderful recipe!!
3858	468	Great cake! I used the modifications suggested by another cook. Microwaved the butter and sugar, used a springform pan and added cinnamon to cake batter. I was surprised at how many Plums suggested. I only needed about two and had no room for blueberries!
3859	468	I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and it was amazing! I definitely recommend this recipe!
3860	468	We LOVED this cake.  I made it per the directions with a very few adjustments.  Doubled the butter and brown sugar (I used real butter and not margarine)as recommended by other reviews.  Placed the blueberries around the outside edge and between my plums for a pretty design.  Cooked in my 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I am making four more this weekend to share with family.  It was a HUGE hit.
3861	468	I liked it 100% the coffee cake was excellent. I should have let it cool longer and let the juice  coagulate more.
3891	472	This was delicious. I used pluots also but used pie crust dough. Over cooked the crust a bit when precooking it so it was a little crispy. I also used hazelnut four and withheld the almond extract because I had some on hand and it still turned out great! Very simple and looks stunning.
4213	519	Even the non cranberry lovers in my family enjoyed this dish!
4214	519	Wonderful! I cut the sugar in half. I added cloves, cinnamon & nutmeg. It was a hit! Will make again.
3862	468	I used coconut flour,  natural cane sugar and blackberries instead of blueberries.  The batter was not pourable or light and fluffy.  It was more of a really loose dough.  I spread it over the fruit and made sure it got gently pressed into the nooks and crannies.  It turned out beautifully.  It was still warm when I cut the first piece and it was soft, almost pudding-like but oh, so tasty.  I covered it and put it in the fridge and hope it will firm up a little.  Even if not, it is still very good.  Next time I will use regular flour which will make it firmer I'm sure.
3863	468	It came out very good.  I use butter instead of margarine. Everyone loves it.
3864	468	This turned out fabulous!   I followed the directions almost exactly, except used all butter instead of margarine.   I couldn’t find my springform pan, so just used a regular non stick round and it came out perfectly after cooling 10 minutes. I greased the pan with Crisco and mixed the butter and brown sugar in a separate bowl and microwaved a tad before spreading it in, so as not to disturb the Crisco coverage.  I used two outer circles of plums, and the middle blueberry.  I also made 5 single lines of blueberries coming out from the center like spokes on a wheel.  Topped with Cool Whip, this was a massive hit!  It did take about 50 minutes vs. 40 in the oven.
3865	469	.only had one plum so i made a half for my mum and a half for me.she still has to taste it but i like it and am sure she will too.
3866	469	This is a great recipe. I would definitely make them again. The only thing I changed is adding a dash of salt and pepper into the juice mixture. And then when they came out of the oven I sprinkled a little sea salt on top. It's especially great with ice cream.
3867	469	This recipe is exactly to my taste! I tested it out for parties and I can't went to serve it my family for Christmas.  It's very sweet, but doesn't really have a dessert taste, in my opinion.  My family and I agree that the best way to serve this would be as a side dish to something savory like chicken, which would temper some of the sweetness.
3868	469	Used apple juice instead of orange.  Delicious
3869	469	Great recipe.  I used less than the recommended cumin.  I also added apples, orange zest, and water.  Reduced the sauce before pouring it over the plums and roasting everything.
3870	469	I made these just as written except I didn't have the  cardamon.
3871	469	I used a whole punnet of plums - I think about ten, and a lot less sugar - about two teaspoons, and didn't have ant orange juice, so I gave it a slug of red wine.
3872	469	My goodness these were so good!!! I added ground cayenne to give them more kick. I served them with french toast and used the sauce over everything instead of syrup. What a great recipe, thank you for sharing it with us.
3873	469	Very good! I used a lot less sugar and don't really recommend doing that unless your fruit is very very ripe!
3874	470	Great recipe,  I substituted plum jam (2-3 tablespoons) instead of plums, and only 1 teaspoon of brown sugar. Cut the cooking time down of sauce to 5-10 minutes and then baked it uncovered in the oven at 180C till cooked meat was 63 degrees.
3875	470	I cut this recipe down to 2 chops.  I used low sodium soy sauce and 3 plums.  My plums were really ripe (soft) and the flesh just squeezed out of the skins, I didn't put the skins in the sauce. I didn't have to cook the sauce very long - maybe 10 minutes.  There isn't a ton of sauce, just enough to coat the pork chops.  I think fresh ginger would be a good addition instead of the ground ginger.
3876	470	I did not like it - the soy sauce was too overpowering.  I made this for 1 person and cooked the sauce only about 10 minutes.  The plums were soft by that point and the sauce was thickened.
3877	470	Love to use fruit to flavor meat. Nice to make rather than a sugary jarful.  Used chicken broth, sprayed with Brach's Amino Acids,  no vinegar or brown sugar, 2 whole cloves vs. ground.  Added leftover pork and chicken to pan to heat.  Already cooked rice noodles so added at end to heat.  Served with cabbage and greens fried in 1 t. bacon grease and sundried tomatoes.  So much better than boring soy sauce by itself on noodles.
3878	470	This was a great base recipe, but as is, I don't think it makes enough sauce. I added about 1 up of pineapple juice, then later another 1/2 cup with some corn starch mixed in to thicken it. Other than that the only other change I made was to sub nutmeg for the cloves, because I didn't have any. I'll definitely make this again! Next time I'll try to get a pic!
3879	470	It was very interesting! Some bites were super delicious, some were quite tart from the skins. I used 2 garlic cloves, and about 2 1/2 tsp. of fresh grated ginger. I substituted nutmeg in for the cloves, because it was what I had. We thought it was good, but missing something, and decided that it needed black pepper. I served the pork chop on top of a pile of quinoa, and spooned the sauce over it all. I would definitely try this again, but next time I would try something to combat/balance a bit of the tartness. Fun to try and yummy!
3880	471	I've now made it twice,  delicious!  Didn't change a thing!
3881	471	I chose this recipe to use up egg whites I had from ice cream making. The dessert is tasty but I didn't understand how to serve it. It is very difficult to put it from the baking dish without breaking. Difficult to cut it. We ate it from the baking dish. The recipe says to bake the dessert until nicely browned. Mine at this point wasn't set yet. We like it but I don't know if I make this again.
3882	471	If you like prunes you will love this. Bakes up soft on the bottom. Do not overbake or it will be hard. I make it the day before serving and the flavors blend well.I also put a layer of vanilla pudding on top and then top with whipped cream.
3883	472	I was disappointed. It sounded fantastic, and I was eager to try this recipe. It looked beautiful. The puff pastry was spectacular. And tasting the frangipani, I was excited about that flavor. But the finished product needed much more of the frangipani. I had not been able to find pluots at the grocery store, and had used peaches. All we could taste in the baked cake was peaches. If I made it again, I would double or triple the frangipani dough.
3884	472	Very Good.  Making it again this week.
3885	472	it was ;hard to make.  The crust didn't hold up well and fell apart.  It tasted terrific.  I would try it again.
3886	472	Lovely use of frangipane and fresh fruit
3887	472	I made this as frangipane filling stuffed pastry, no fruit. It turned out great!!
3888	472	Pressed PuffPastry into tall start shell forms, and due to space restrictions, filled them with frangipane only, but holy frickin cow this recipe is awesome.
3889	472	I made this just as the recipe states. It was great and the family loved it!
3890	472	I made this just as the recipe states. It was great and the family loved it!
4215	519	Made this last Thanksgiving and I can not wait to serve it again. Everyone loved it!
3892	473	I did not intend to make any changes to this recipe, but my dough was crumbly so I added more mashed potato.  Also, I made them round all over instead of pinching one end.  This was a hit with my husband, whose grandmother was Austrian.  My German aunt Judy is famous for making these, too!
3893	473	Definitely a dessert - not a main or side dish. These were OK, but I'll stick to crisps and cobblers in the future. The texture was a bit weird and I definitely was craving some ice cream on the side.
3894	473	This is an excellent recipe. I ended up using more potatoes to get the right consistency of dough, closer to two cups. I folded one circle over, like a perogy, rather than using two - mostly to get more dumplings. I also boiled and then pan fried, which made them way better!
3895	473	My mom used to make these. Loved them. Once they were s little fried in the pan on to the plate they would go with s little cream. My dessert. It was one of those little things that I didn't get a chance to ask my mom before she passed away. No one else could remember how they were made. Thank you. Fond memories...
3896	473	I make a few changes; brown sugar, cream cheese for the filling, added vanilla to the dough and brandy to the sauce and omitted the bread crumbs.  To top it off I deep fried them and served them with ice cream and they were amazing!
3897	473	I just tried this recipe out tonight. It took a little while, but was definately worth it! I will be sure to use this again next year!
3898	473	The only thing I did differently was to make the sugar mixture a bit more interesting.   I used some white sugar, but mostly brown sugar, and cinnamon and fresh-grated nutmeg and seasoned to my taste preferences.   Some plums got a double dose of the sugar&spice mixture; by the time they were ready to get wrapped, they'd juiced up so some of the mixture had run out and I topped it up again (oh, the horror!).   And that is the only thing I changed. The pastry worked out and despite some misgivings at when I first started mixing the ingredients together, the texture actually turned out perfectly.   The next time I make this, it'll be with a couple of friends, or something. It's time-consuming and a fair bit of work, but oh man, so delicious.
3899	473	Great to see this recipe.  I remember my Hungarian Grandmother making these and they were great!!  I never thought I would find a recipe for them.  Now I can hardly wait to try.  Jane
3900	473	Growing up we looked forward to plum dumplings in the fall.  I found Italian plums at the market and wanted to make them.  I couldn't find my moms recipe, but found one where the dough was made with farina instead of potatoes, and turned out just like mom's.  This saves some prep time.  Also we didn't pit the plums, which also saves time.  Maybe they should be tested for tartness first though.  I was looking for a recipe to tell me how to freeze them.  Thanks I hope this works.
3901	474	Added 1/3 cup milk because the batter was super dry
3902	474	Used cardamom seeds and just blended it all. Pods might work better as some seeds didn't get completely blended.
3903	474	If you delete the water and butter, add 5 pods of 5 star anise, couple of table spoons fresh lemon and cook down the mixture to about one third you will have my Grandmothers plum “butter”! A taste of an Old German memory! Oh and I did cut and pull out the seeds of the Italian prune plums...much easier. I it is thick so you don’t have to do anything to the mixture (you could mash with potato masher ) except pour into your jars! Makes about 5 pints!
3904	474	Great recipe.  My family really enjoyed the favors and texture.  I did not have cardamom pods, so I substituted 3 teaspoons of pure almond extract. Thanks for sharing.
3905	474	This turned out so nice.  At the farmers market I found some lovely tart plums.  They made a deal with me since I was buying 5 lb.  These plums had a a fairly free stone, so I pitted them before beginning.  Because of the long process time and so many things happening, I pitted the plums the night before and refrigerated them in water with a splash of lemon juice.  I used that as cooking liquid the next day.
3906	474	Made it yesterday, and tried it today.  We liked it, and will make it again.
3907	474	Adapted this recipe to a quarter-batch, using dark prune plums. Worked perfectly  except for cooking time. Simmered for two hours after removing pits and began to suspect that was way too long. I was right -- the jam was delicious, but set up like rubber. Second batch, cooking time after pit removal = 45 minutes. Jam turned out perfect.
3908	474	So far sounds perfect- I hate pitting fruit to can.  I do a lemon jam this way, so I'm pretty sure it'll work.  I did put in 2 cinnamon sticks, about a teaspoon of ground cardamom, and a Tablespoon of lemon juice.  Update:  I learned a cool method of pitting and peeling, but jam is too tart, and didn't firm up, stayed a syrup.  Fruit also had a burnt flavor because it cooked so long.  Will be a perfect cobbler filling.
3909	474	Only had 2.14 lbs so the cardamom was dropped to 7 pods and the sugar to 2 cups. Cooked for about an hour  and made 4 half-pints. Never again will I waste my time or ingredients by fishing for plum seeds in the jam. Cut the plums in half before you begin, remove the seeds, and save yourself a lot of mess, time, and most importantly, fruit. The finished jam is tart and delicious. Will make it any time I can get my hands on Damsons.
3910	475	I’ve been searching for a cobbler recipe for a while and finally found it!
3911	475	Great starter recipe! Made it with the following revisions: used 10 peaches, 1 c raspberries, 3 c blueberries and 2c blackberries - all fresh. Added 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 flour plus 2 tsp apple pie spice to fruit and mixed well. Tripled the batter recipe and split the fruit and batter between 2 9x9” pans. Baked in oven for 50 minutes instead of 30- at 30 the batter wasn’t brown enough- at 40 min the batter was still doughy in the middle.
3912	475	Very delicious I was surprised there were no eggs, and the batter was crisp I used 2 types of plums. Excellent
3913	475	6.8.20 Used a combination of peaches, cherries, and blueberries.  This was good, just a bit on the dry side for a cobbler.  Would have liked the fruit just a bit juicier.
3914	475	This easy dessert was tasty, and just right with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I liked the tender, cake-like crust.  It reminded me of my mother's cobbler, but I wanted some fruit syrup to develop as it cooked.  I think lots of folks are judging against what their mom or grandma made, so a cobbler has a different definition for everyone.  For me, I think the cobbler needs more fruit, at least another 1 1/2 cups.  I believe the extra fruit and about 1/4 cup of sugar, moved from the crust to the fruit, will help some syrup to develop.  At any rate, I'm glad I found this recipe, and I know my family will be quite happy.  In fact, I'll bet the cobbler will be gone, by bedtime!  Thanks for the idea!
3915	475	simple and easy...I doubled it, and needed to double the time for cooking.  I covered it 30 mins in with foil so it wouldn't burn.
5542	705	This was amazing!  My husband had seconds and my stepdaughter is vegan and ate it without the salmon and still loved it!
3916	475	To be honest, I've been making variations of this recipe for over 30 yrs.  I make it even easier by using Buisquik, and adding sugar and vanilla to the batter when its wet.  Super easy my way, takes 10 minutes to prepare.
3917	475	Yum! This was delicious and very easy to make! Will definitely make this again.
3918	475	I substituted gluten free flour and needed to bake it a bit longer.  Turned out very well and disappeared later that evening.  Some preferred it with ice cream while others preferred it with fresh whipped cream.  I like it naked.  Hot, crispy, chewy and gooey.  Mmm-hmmm!
3919	476	This cake is tremendously delicious. My family and I love it, and I have made it several times. We like to call it 'plummy cake' because it is so rich, and it is, after all, made with 'plums'. It is one of those nice, old-fashioned cakes filled with fruit and nuts.The icing is splendid too. I have found that the amount of icing made by the recipe somewhat drowns my cake. However, the last time I made it, I cut the icing recipe in half, and it was the perfect amount.
3920	476	I followed recipe exactly..it turn out great.. very rich & delicious..will make again..& again!My family loved it❤️
3921	476	I'm 82 years old. This is SAME recipe my grandmother used for her Christmas gift cakes about 65 years ago. All ingredients are the same so this is truly a very old recipe. Thanks for sharing!
3922	476	I can't say it's the best cake I ever had but it was tasty. Very easy to make and spiced just right. I used a mixture of prunes and dried apricots and it worked out fine. I cut the nuts down to one cup. The cake was nice and moist. I made a cream cheese frosting to go on it. Everyone went back for seconds.  I would make it again. A perfect cake for autumn with a hot cup of coffee.
3923	476	I did not make any changes in the recipe. Followed it exactly and the cake turned out delicious! Everyone loved it. I used canola oil.
3924	476	I baked this cake exactly like the recipe and it turned out very dense didn't rise at all. Made some changes by adding 1tsp baking powder , a stick of butter and a total of 3 eggs also 1 3/4 cups buttermilk. The cake came out perfect fluffy moist. With the few changes I'll be making every year at the holidays!
3925	476	Great cake, brings back childhood memories!    I made it in a regular cake pan and doubled the prunes. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2% and added a couple tbsp of butter.  I drizzled a piece of it with raspberry sauce and white chocolate sauce.  Then ate my next piece plain. Both were great!
3926	476	My mom made this cake also..but she poured the icing over it hot in the tube pan and let it soak into the cake..it really made a difference.. Thank you for the memory and recipe
3927	476	We all really enjoyed this!  Even my 3 wee ones!! Made exactly as written!  Will def make again!
3928	477	Good, used 1 packet Splenda.  7 pt as is
3929	477	Delicious.  I used Almond milk in place of the water and a small banana to sweeten the cereal.   Will be my go to breakfast and the ingredient list can be so varied.
3930	477	I agree; this needs brown sugar for flavor. I use Sucanat (dehydrated sugar cane) which gives big molasses flavor with less sugar. Also, I added a dash of sea salt, it helps bind the flavors (just a DASH). Dates are gorgeous in this, but I only added ONE because they're so sweet. Adding organic frozen blueberries and a few sliced almonds or walnuts tossed in when the flame is off makes it anything but bland. Be adventurous--this is just a template, as all recipes are! ;)
3931	477	This recipe was ok, but not great. I will not make it again because there are too many other recipes that have the wow factor.
3932	477	Unfortunately, no one in our family enjoyed this.  It was mushy and had a very bland taste.  We added mashed bananas for sweetness but would not do this again.
3933	477	I tried this recipe for the first time today, as I didn't have prunes I used frozen raspberries and dried apricots and nuts.  It was delicious and so easy to make.
3934	477	an easy fast breakfast!   I used xytol to make mine sugar free, mixed in sugar free strawberry jam, and it was amazing.
3935	477	This was a great quick breakfast, with a few healthy modifications: instead of sugar substitute 1/2 t of brown sugar and 1/2 t of honey. Plus 1 tbs of wheat germ. After reading the other reviews I decided to add half of a mashed banana, yummy! Plus a half ounce of walnuts, for extra protein. I will definitely make this recipe again!
3936	477	Wow! I made this exactly as the recipe states & it's so good!! What a great, easy breakfast, thanks!
3937	478	I loved this recipe.  I only added half cup extra of brown sugar.  90 mins to cook . absolutely will make again.
3938	478	After reading some reviews, I added a pinch of salt and a tsp of vanilla. I also substituted butter.  I sugared the 9x13 pan as well as dusted some sugar on top before baking. I must admit I thought this recipe was going to be a dud when I plastered it into the pan. But after baking it for 50 minutes, it was cooked through and came out of the pan cleanly. This is a very moist and delicate flavored cake. I think this would be great as a breakfast bread or as a summer dessert served with ice cream.
3939	478	This is a solid recipe! Our bread came out delicious!!!I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mashed bananas (I love cinnamon in banana bread, so I thought “hey! Why not?!”); otherwise I followed the recipe, and it’s a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!
3940	478	Trying to eat healthier.  No sugar. 1 cup whole wheat  and 1 2/3 white flour. Always cook with real butter. A little salt with the other ingredients. 1 cup milk because it was really stiff. Added prunes and walnuts. You could just about add any fruit or nut. Baked 15 minutes in muffin tray. Nice basic recipe. Husband really liked them. Next time we will add apricots and pecans.
3941	478	I added 2 cups of plum pieces. The loaf was delicious - light, airy and so flavourful.   I'll definitely make this again. Thank you
3942	478	Sooo good! Only thing I’d say is after it’s been in the oven for an hour it wasn’t cooked all the way through and was still uncooked in the middle, so I turned down the temp to 300° F and baked it for about 20 more minutes and it was cooked all the way through. Loveeeddd this recipe! So simple and delicious!
3943	478	It turned out great as is. I substituted Splenda for the sugar, salted butter for the margarine, and puréed the plums, mixing them in with the mashed bananas. They were light, flavorful, but not sweet, and crunchy on top. I made them as muffins, baking for 30 minutes.
3944	478	Very good. Tasty. I added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp salt and vanilla.  will make this again. moist and flavorful
3972	481	I'm honestly in tears, my Oma used to make this for me when I was little but she wouldn't give me the recipe! Thank you so much for posting this, I'll be making some for my roommates who are from China!
3945	478	My family really liked this bread with a tad bit of tartness.  After reading the reviews, and respecting mis7up, as a fellow buzzer, I took her advice and added a little extra sugar.  I added an additional 1/4 cup, making my total 3/4 cup.  Butter (all I use) was used in place of margarine.  I decided to bake in 5 mini (6x3 1/2) loaf pans rather than a 13x9 pan. They rose beautifully and were done at the 35 minute mark.  I served this bread with 'Christmas Morning Egg Casserole' from AR.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoys them as bread, but our favorite way to eat them is toasted.  It seems to really make the flavors pop, and it did so with this recipe.  I would definitely make this recipe again.
3946	479	I didn’t use applejuice  but I used berry juice
3947	479	I JUST got finished putting this jam in the jars and into the canner! It smells WONDERFUL!!! And, I can't wait to try it!! The holidays are coming, and it smells like Christmas in here!
3948	479	Very Christmas-y!  I used fresh plums from my uncle’s plum tree, only used 1tsp of cloves, and didn’t add any food coloring, and I thought it turned out perfect!  My granny asked for the recipe, and if that’s not a positive review- I don’t know what is!!
3949	479	I used the whole  large can of crushed pineapple including the juices instead of the fresh pineapple and I didn't have apple juice so I just left it out knowing that there would be juice with the can of pineapple. I loved this recipe so much and it turned out so well that I made two batches. Like other reviews that I read for this recipe, it did smell and taste like Christmas at my house! My husband and teenage boys also feel in love with it and that is saying a lot especially for my boys, because they can be my best critics! :)
3950	479	Very sweet but good
3951	479	It’s delicious and set up beautifully. I didn’t have oj concentrate so I used 1/2c orange marmalade.
3952	479	I’ll make this again, I added hot pepper flakes for a little heat. It smells like Christmas and is really good on pork!
3953	479	Great recipe!!! I made a few changes.  I used 4 1/2 cups of sugar cane, added 1/2 cup of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoons of nutmeg and ground cloves, used no pectin, but cooked slow. At the end of cooking, I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and almond.  It took me 7 hours to get to the desired thickness I wanted.   It was well worth the time.  My family loves it.
3954	479	Made it without the pineapple and it is still delicious .  Makes the house smell like Christmas. Very popular with the family so I made another batch.
3955	480	This was delicious my husband enjoyed them. Tasty way to us prunes.  Didn’t use the crumb topping but I did squiggle top with confection sugar icing after they cooled. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.
3956	480	I think this recipe calls for too much yeast.  Most of my rolls looked like volcanoes.  Either the oven temperature should be 375° or the baking time increased to 22-25 minutes. I didn’t use the streusel topping for a cleaner presentation and I used Bosc pear filling instead of prune. It was fun to prepare.
3957	480	I could not eat it (long story) but everybody who tried it loved it.
3958	480	My kolaches were to die for, other than that!  I used 1 cup of damson plum jelly instead of prunes and just added the spices & lime juice to it...very, very tasty filling. I baked them for about 40 minutes.  They are crunchy around the edges and top and are soft on the inside.  They are delicious! I made a cup of coffee to drink with the first one I tried and never drank the coffee - that good! TY Grandma Skeet, & SCOOBYVC
3959	480	My Czech great-grandmother made prune kolaches so I grew up eating them and these taste the closest to hers. Thank you for this recipe!
3960	480	My Polish/Slavic mother-in-law taught me how to make these but her's was more of a cookie and used cream cheese, butter and flour for the cookie. She used Solo canned prune fruit filling which is almost impossible to find. I'll use her recipe for the cookie but I'm excited to try your filling.
3961	480	I have made this simular recipe many times as  I grew up with these, the difference is before baking we top it with coconut instead of the streusel,then after it cools we sprinkle powdered sugar on it. My mother made the dough by hand, and I too use the bread machine. For the prune filling, I don't follow a recipe since I learned from watching my mother but is pretty much the same, I never used lime juice before but I think that may be something I will try. My daughter loves them and I HAVE to make them every year for her birthday which is in a few days . I just picked up the ingrediants this morning for them, and I always make extra for my husband and me.
3962	480	I made this and used apricot jam instead of prunes for the filling.  It is wonderful!  I had a lot of the topping left over, not sure how I could have used all of it.  When I was done, I did go ahead and put a vanilla drizzly glaze over them, which I liked a lot. :)
3963	480	wow, who would have thought i could make such pastries? this recipe made it simple. mine came out sweet and sticky! i made the filling ahead of time and let it set in the fridge. i'm thankful for the update - good to know when/how long to let them rise!
3964	481	My mother used to make potato-plum dumplings then bake them in the oven with pork roast.  Oh!!  Yummmmm!!!!
3965	481	My Bohemian Grandmother made these for dessert.  It is a great recipe.
3966	481	My grandmother,aunt and mom all made these.  It took a lot of work since my mom always made a massive batch of them so my mom, the last survivor with the recipe, stopped making them as she got older.  I found her recipe book but the measurements and method weren't clear.  These were very good but my family's were better.  Perhaps it wasthat we used prunes, sweetened them and then boiled them.  It was more like a prune filling than a cooked plum.  Have to give this recipe a try with plums.
3967	481	I found the dough to be extremely sticky and added pretty much another 2 cups of flour before I could roll it out.  I guess you could use a little at a time and not roll it out.  Then my  breadcrumbs really didn't stick well because my dumplings were cold before we ate them.  Also, any ideas for a garnish?? thanks Dan
3968	481	Learned to make this from my grandmother and always loved it.  I also like making this dish with apricots in exactly the same way.  Yum.
3969	481	Great recipe!  very similar to my Austrian grandmother's. I left the pit in and just added sugar at the table. that saves some prep time. also I made extra breadcrumbs because you can never have enough sweetened breadcrumbs!!!
3970	481	Amazing!!! My Gramma used to make these and this recipe tastes just like hers! We always ate them with sour cream and sugar. Delicous
3971	481	I make these in large batches to freeze every year. When any of our children (all in their late 20's early 30's) spend the weekend...this is on the top of their wish list. I add a little cinnamon to the bread crumbs, butter and sugar coating. DELICIOUS!!
3973	482	I’m not sure what it tastes like. It looks beautiful. I love shortbread so it should be good. The dough was mixed in my mixer until it almost came together then I kneaded it a bit before refrigerating it for an hour. I halved the pear then cut each 1/2 into 4 slices but kept them connected.
3974	482	These recipe has been in my family for many years
3975	483	I really liked this dessert; it is definitely one I will make again. I just have one question though; why is it necessary to leave the rum out when children are eating it, if the rum cooks out while it is baking?
3976	483	I never eat Far Breton before, the first time i made this is to impressed my french husband which is from Brittany. I tried this recipe few times without alcohol or without vanilla sugar. It still taste great no matter what your choice.  I use sunsweet pitted prunes and add Grand Marnier in my cake instead of rum. Nowadays i make Far Breton  at least once a month, the french (my husband and his colleague) really love it.
3977	483	I kept it in the oven a little longer to let it sit. It was amazing overall. Glad I picked this to use my leftover prunes.
3978	483	Mine turned out a little wet and it curdled wishing it would be smooth and dense like the first picture.  I did like the crust though.  Update: took it out from the fridge and it did look like the pictures but the overall taste was just okay.
3979	483	Mine did not come out like the picture. It was wetter and not as flan like. Also the top and bottom was burned. Although the taste was great. Will try this again.
3980	483	Excellent recipe! I did not have baking powder so, I separated the eggs, put the yolks with the flour, sugar, milk,ect.. blended them in a blender then, I whipped/folded the whites in last. Baked beautifully. Used some real vanilla bean too...Yummy
3981	483	Absolutely fantastic! Like the previous reviewer, I needed to use up some very old prunes. This is insanely easy to make and extremely delicious. I followed the recipe to a T, except for using an 11x7 inch baking dish, using soy milk, and using half of a vanilla pod instead of the vanilla sugar. Tried it warm about 20 minutes after taking it out of the oven and it was perfect. The baking time was spot on. I too am excited to try it cold tomorrow. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will make for years to come! ***** Update: I tried this cold after it was in the fridge all night. Surprisingly, I like it MUCH better warm or at room temperature.
3982	483	I wanted to use leftover prunes and found this recipe.  I made it as written with the exception of the vanilla sugar.  I added 1 tsp vanilla instead.  The presentation was impressive, the preparation simple and the result was delicious!!!!  My husband was equally impressed.  We just ate it, warm after about ten minutes.  I want to try it cold tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe!
3983	484	The cooks notes says the original recipe makes an 11x13 cake.  I believe this is a misprint.  Even at 11x15, there is more cake than others of this style.  I use a 12x18 sheet cake pan.
3984	484	If I use dry yeast, how much would I use
3985	484	Good recipe, it came out nice! Two important points though: the amount of dough turns out to be enough for a cake amost double the size. As it is in the recipe it would overflow the tray and shed plums to the sides. Also: is it absolutely vital that an amount of milk/water is more precisely specified for the kneading phase. For a non-expert "as needed" doesn't make any sense, and the level of moisture achieved is critical for a good drozdzówka, because if too dry it's miserable.
3986	484	I've been looking for years for a recipe for a cake made with yeast, longing to replicate one we used to get all the time from the bakery in the Polish neighborhood where my father lived. I was so excited when I found this one, but alas, this came out more like a heavy bread than a cake. I think I'll try it again someday, using half the flour and double the milk. Also, the instructions say to "knead in as much air as possible," but as a cooking technique, kneading is about pushing air out, not incorporating it in. So I'm not sure what the author means by that. I think if this were more of a batter it might be a good recipe.
3987	484	We have corrected the yeast amount to two (0.6-ounce) cakes of fresh yeast.
3988	485	Made this last week since i was out. Made 8 750ml jars (big batch) used my apples and plums from the trees. Holy smoker doodle dandy im using this recipe from now on
3989	485	Imagine A-1 steak sauce with an extra kick.  I make this for my husband, and to give away as gifts; this year I added grated zucchini.
3990	485	I put this up yesterday and was able to get 20 half pints.  I only added 1 teas of cayenne pepper and the rest of the recipe I kept the same.  I tasted it and it is very good.  The consistency is that of apple butter and about the same color.  I think this is going to taste really good with pork chops.
3991	486	This is my favorite cake/dessert now. I read the reviews of others and doubled the custard. I also tried it twice already and found out that light cream gives better results.
3992	486	No way the crust fit into a 9" sq. Made it in 8" instead. No need for 2 1/2 cups of plums. WAY too much, even if you used a 9" pan. It's a very sweet dessert. Not bad but I think you could cut back the 1/2 cup sugar a bit.
3993	486	Mixed up a double batch of custard as suggested in other reviews but only used 1/2.
3994	486	I made extra custard.  Lovely, and with my tart plums, was not to sweet.
3995	486	Great easy cake that looks impressive.  Doubled the custard and was awesome!
3996	486	I followed the recipe but took advice about the custard. I doubled the custard and added 1tbs cornstarch as I had extra plums and WOW it is so good. Will make again with any fruit coming in season.
3997	486	so very good loved it
3998	486	I will definitely make this again. I may have used the wrong kind of plum, making the dish a little wet between the cake and the custard. I'm going to try it with apples.
3999	486	The only thing I changed was using evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. I usually substitute half & half for heavy cream, but was out of it. It worked fine. I used black plums because that's what I had. This cake is a nice blend of tart and sweet. We liked it both warm and cold. I think it is fine without doubling the custard. I'm not a fan of really sweet desserts, and doubling the custard might make it too sweet as others have suggested. I will definitely make this again. I think it would be good with other fruits as well, such as peaches and nectarines.
4000	487	I could not find any fresh plums will use prunes we had blueberries and
4001	487	Easy to make and I used my handheld immersion blender.  Makes a great presentation drizzled on pork.  It certainly was sweet but not too sweet against the pork.  I omitted the blueberry juice and added just a bit of water to help get the plums cooking.  Made this to see if it was worth making for an upcoming dinner and it will be on the menu.
4002	487	This dish is a 5 out of 5! I will make it many times! It has an elegant presentation and the plum reduction is beautiful both in look and flavor! I served it with a dish from this site "Butternut Squash with Apple and Cranberries" ..... they seemed to perfectly compliment each other perfectly. I will marry those two dishes!
4003	487	I really didn't like this but my husband said it was "okay" so I'll rate it 2 stars instead of 1.  The cooking time is way off - you'll have rare pork unless you cook it longer.  I spent quite a bit of time researching pork cooking times to try and get it right  (lent my meat thermometer out and it hasn't been returned yet).  The sauce tasted exactly like raisins.  I love balsamic and was excited about it but mixed with these other flavors you're just left with raisin.  I love raisins but not with pork tenderloin.
4004	487	There's  a lot better thing to do with pork tenderloin.
4005	487	Crazy good and easy.  I used blueberrires instead of plums
4006	487	This had a lot of good flavor, but the sauce turned out more like a chutney, which I didn't mind. Sort of like cranberry sauce. I also just mashed the plums instead of blending it, so maybe that was the issue. The recipe didn't make nearly enough sauce, so doubled it and added chicken stock to thin out.
4007	487	I had the butcher at Kroger cut a pork loin in half to make it a 2lb loin (I live by myself), and it was the perfect size. It cooked beautifully as directed by ziprose.
4008	487	This plum sauce is so yummy, I recommend doubling it. This recipe is tastes like a variation of Thanksgiving turkey with cranberry sauce. I served this to a group of friends, and they loved it.
4009	488	Need to add a lot more water and milk to get it to a consistency to “pour” per instruction
4010	488	I read some of the reviews and decided to sub in the figs for the plums for a figgy pudding. I made it for New Years Eve. My family liked it. I served it with fresh whipped cream.
4011	488	I've tried a number of Christmas pudding recipes, and this was the first I found that did *not* have suet.  In the USA, it's hard to get beef suet, and pork suet does NOT work.  Not only that, but the suet gives it a strange musky taste that my family doesn't care for anyway.
4012	488	Terrific.  I doubled it and used figs instead of dates  So while there are no plums it became a "figgy pudding" perfect for the season.  I used a bundt pan to steam it in and later served it cold with "creme de cassis" (black current brandy) drizzled over the top and then whipped cream.  Could become our new favorite for Christmas!!
4013	488	Loved it. I added a couple of ounces of rum to my batter. Smells wonderful!??
4014	488	This looks very good-will try it soon. I just wanted to warn everyone to not use real Holly or the berries for decoration.
4015	488	Just perfect.  Served with a traditional sweet white sauce.  In Wales, we would even hide a sixpence in it.
4016	488	This sounds great and I would really like to try it, but no where in the recipe does it tell me how to steam it.  I think that knowing how to steam it would be very important.
4017	488	A fantastic, rich and authentic tasting dessert. Perfect for finishing off any Christmas dinner.
4018	489	I put half the batter down and layered a quart of home canned peaches drained. Then put the other half the batter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar
4019	489	Fruit sunk to bottom. Cooking time way too long; cooked minimum suggested and cake was over cooked, very dark on top and very dry.
4020	489	Simply a great cake that tastes as fresh as summer mornings. Easy to make and delicious for breakfast or tea time. I had a hard time fitting all the fruit on top. In fact, in the end I had to leave out one peach and one plum. I guess the final amount will depend on the size of your fruit.
4021	490	This is a very good prune filling. I did stew dried prunes in apple juice because that’s what I had. I made fruit filled cookie bars with it and my grandkids loved it, they didn’t know it was prunes lol!
4022	490	I made a half batch of this filling, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also used dried prunes that I stewed in orange juice with some orange zest (so I ended up using orange juice instead of the lime juice called for in the recipe). This filling is slightly spicy, sweet, citrus-y, and definitely prune flavored (which I love!). I'm going to use it to fill paczki's. Thank you for the recipe!
4023	490	I could not find canned prunes so I bought dried prunes and added 1 cup prune juice for each cup of dried prunes.  It turned out great!! I used the filling to make Kolaches.
4024	491	The neighbors had Italian prune plums and I pitted and puréed them. It’s delicious, I got four pints out of eight cups of plums.
4025	491	Turned out really good. Used it on BBQ chicken.
4026	491	as written it was too sweet for us and not quite spicy wnough since I used vey few of the seeds. it was also too liquidy for me after the allotted cooking time. This is why I gave it 4 stars. So I added anothrr jalapeno and added extra vinegar. I cooked it for at least twice as long because it was too liquidy.  it was still liquidy but it jelled to jam thickness as it sat. I made it again with 1/2 cup less sugar and an extra 1/2 jalapeno and cooking it longer.
4027	491	This is ridiculously good.  I did not use the liquid smoke.  I did use the chipotle in adoba.
4028	491	My favorite sauce to use on salmon loaf and salmon burgers.
4029	491	I had a gallon, or 4 quarts, of right Italian prune plums. The smaller, egg shape plums. I can imagine the task of pressing each of those raw through a colander to get juice. I also wanted to make as many jars as possible to can for Christmas gifts. I had to do some math for the conversions that I hope will be helpful to someone else. There are 6 to 8 regular size plums in 1 pound. For my Italian plums, there are 11 to 12. That means 44 plums to 1 quart. For this recipe, that would be 220 small plums. I simply cut them in half to remove the pit and then put them in my food processor. I buzzed 10 at a time and got them as smooth as possible. I repeated this until I had used all the plums and in total, I got 25 cups of. Fruit. You would get 33 cups if you had the 5 quarts the recipe calls for. I increased the vinegar and added a quarter cup of pectin just to make sure that this would can and keep well. I also read reviews about it being a too sweet and knew the vinegar would both help at preserve it and tone down the sweetness. I processed half pints in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes and got 32 jars! Already served it with roast pork and then tacos and everyone loved it. I will share pictures and the full ingredients are used: 25 cups puréed plums. 1/4 cup pectin. 4 cups apple cider vinegar. 6 cups sugar. 6 cloves garlic. 2 1/2 Tbs salt. 1 large onion. 1 jalapeño. 1/4 cup chipotle peppers in adobo. Cooked everything down for an hour and a half at a simmer before canning.
4216	519	Fantastic!  I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 C and it seemed perfectly sweet.  Thanks for the delicious recipe, it was perfect at our Thanksgiving table!
4030	491	Absolutely love this bbq sauce.  This is my second year making it.  It is a bit difficult to get any juice out of the plums just by squeezing them by hand.  I ended up using a juicer, and my food processor.  I like it a bit chunkier than the recipe is.  And I do recommend using Penzeys chipotle seasoning.  I used about 1/2 of the amount, and it was perfect.  Oh, and skipped the jalepeno as well.  I didnt think it needed it.
4031	491	First off -- I am not a fan of plums, but this is SOOO good.
4032	491	Ths is the second year I have made this; it became a staple for us over the winter. It is kind of a barbecue sauce. It is spicy, sweet, and had a nice heat to it. I use it to perk up baked chicken and pork chops. I have poured it over roasts. It is just yummy.
4033	492	Because it was just for the two of us,  i used a very thick boneless pork chop cutting a space dwon the center. Didn't have apricots so used yellow raisins.  Very tasty.
4034	492	I have provided this roast a few times now. I always get great reviews.
4035	492	This roast turned out very good. I followed directions except that I used orange marmalade and cranberries from freezer for the stuffing . May have been a little overdone as it was hard to position the meat thermometer with the filling in the middle. Would definitely try again
4036	492	Nothing special.
4037	492	Very good.  Might use less cinnamon
4038	492	Not a bad recipe.  The flavors just didn't go over well in my family at all.  I should have listened when a lot of the reviews talked about using this dish for Christmas dinner.  That's about the only time I could see making this again.  Just not an everyday kind of dish.
4039	492	I've been making this dish, (or some variation) for 30 years. It's a wonderful main dish for any occasion. I'm making it for Christmas this year.
4040	492	I did alter the recipe.  I only had fresh figs and apples.  So, that is what I used.  I omitted the  cumin.  It was excellent!
4041	492	made this a few months ago,  the spices were too much,  and the fruit could have been better.  since then over made a bunch of changed and made a completely different recipe for a stuffed loin.
4042	493	I strained the skin out of the mix and it mixed up fluffy.
4043	493	Totally delicious! Didn’t make any adjustments and thought it super easy to make. This is a flummery so I had no issues with the skins…in fact it added to the dish. I have now made this using strawberries next going to try blueberries.
4044	493	I didn't think this was going to work as I was making it because I couldn't get the evaporated milk to get thick when I whipped it. I'd never whipped evaporated milk before and I expected it to thicken more like cream, but it doesn't. It just gets a bit bubbly. But I mixed it in anyway and put it in the fridge and it did thicken! And it tasted delicious. I left out the lemon juice because I was using sour plums, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was really good!
4045	493	Lovely tart taste of plums combined with light texture of the slightly sweet milky base.  Will definitely make again
4046	493	It turned out really nice...best use of plums...
4047	493	This didn't turn out for me, maybe I didn't whip milk long enough. I might try it again.
4048	493	I really was just expecting a so so kind of coffee cake. But, boy, was I wrong! This cake (kuchen) was absolutely delicious. I used plums off of my tree (I had a huge bumper crop) and I was so glad it turned out as good as it did. I thought it would be too sweet but the plums gave it a delicious tanginess. I0t would be good with ice cream, a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. I will definitely be making this again0
4049	493	I think this has good potential, but my family did not prefer it. I think the biggest complaint was the skins.  Next time I try it I will check out some of the other reviewers ideas and definitely make sure they are peeled and pureed.
4050	493	A great light, fruity dessert for summer. I cooked the plums much longer, removing the skins along the way, and used regular evaporated milk -- no fat means no texture when you whip it. I also chilled the bowl first, just like when you whip cream, to make it as light and airy as possible. Next time, I think I'll cut the lemon juice by half, it doesn't need that extra tartness and I want more of the plum flavor to come through. I may also try reducing some of the plum juice, or even use that instead of water for the gelatine.
4051	494	i made as written. and it was way to sweet. (and i love sweets) i had to add another 3 cups of strong black tea. i will be making this again but with less sugar.
4052	494	Very good.  A very chunky drink.
4053	494	This recipe makes a wonderful, tasty, satisfying drink.  My wife and I made it for our first baby shower and all those we tried it enjoyed it immensely.  The subtle blending of the multiple flavours work wonderfully together.  I was skeptical about adding the tea, but was pleasently surprised at it's non overpowering presense, instead it brought the taste of the fruit even more to the forefront.  I would reccomend this recipe to anyone looking for a drink to satisfy all.  Plus with it's added attraction of the fresh fruit floating on top, it makes an eye pleasing addition to any table.  It's a fruit salad in your glass!
4054	495	These turned out delicious. Delicious, but not picture perfect. I thought I had a pound and a half  of butter in the fridge. Well no, I had 3 and a half sticks. (Crud!!) So I halved the recipe.  Then I proceeded to add to my confusion by cutting the dough log into 1.5 inch sections. Since I only had half the amount of dough for the recipe I should have cut it into 3 inch sections.  So the dough circles were too small and consequently the triangles were about half the size they should have been. This made them difficult to fill and roll. Oh well! I had bite-size Rogaliki.Besides making them small, the only deviation I made was with the yeast. Even with starting out with the milk at room temperature, after 12 minutes in a nice warm spot it had not even started to proof.  I stirred in about a half teaspoon of white sugar to kick-start the process. It worked. The yeast foamed up within 5 minutes.
4055	495	loved them!
4056	496	We lived in Germany for awhile and we have a plum tree. So every year I try a plum recipe  to see if it can match the ones in Europe.  This was great and my search is over. 5 stars!!
4057	496	Couldn't find plums - used mixed berries instead.
4058	496	Divine. Had enough pastry and plums to make two pies - one as shown but in larger tin and one lattice topped in 9" pie dish. This is a fantastic pastry - I was worried the bottom would be soggy - it was anything but! Froze the lattice top pie and reheated before serving - still tasted as good as the one we ate fresh. Highly reccommended.
4059	496	Dough was too thick/high; traditionally known as thinner base
4249	530	Delicious and beautiful salad!
4302	541	Two persimmon trees in yard. Lots of persimmons so we made two pies! Took them to a party where there were other pies--ours were gone before we went home!
4060	496	Actually I have a question but can't find a place to ask. This is an awesome recipe and love love love it. But I was wondering what to leave out or increase to make the dough not rise quite as much? My mothers was not as fluffy and would like to make it more that way. Thanks in advance for any help.
4061	496	It is important to use ripe Plums! Otherwise it will taste sour, most People dont know how good Plums can taste because they are eating sour unripe Plums. Also for added sweetness its typical to make sugar crumbes to put on top.
4062	496	I did not care for this.
4063	496	This is a terrific dessert!  I remember having this type of pastry when I lived in Germany.  I will definitely make this.  This pastry is like comfort food.
4064	496	My german mother (and grandmother) always added a struesel topping for added goodness and then a dusting of powdered sugar.
4065	497	This is a very colorful dessert, but ...1) Pressed for time, I had to skip the sweet crumble topping, but for me, the fruit part was way too tart (this being what happens to sweet, ripe plums when cooked), and needed separate sweetening.2) To be honest, the method of incorporating the ingredients was mystifying to me.  First of all, when did 2/3 c. butter mixed with 1 1/2 cups sugar ever become "smooth and creamy"? Then, after adding the eggs, how does one "stir in" a whole 3 cups of flour? Why not sift the dry ingredients  separately and then add them alternately with the first part of the milk (the usual process with cakes)?This cake does take much longer to bake than most.
4066	497	I subbed brown sugar for white in the topping.  I also sprinkling a little sugar over the plums, which I’ll do this next time I make this awesome cake.
4067	497	This is great for a desert. I made it as directed but added a bit of oats to the topping, along with some of my favorite spices. (Nutmeg, mace, ginger)
4068	497	If I had stuck to the original recipe I'm sure it would have been perfect. Firstly to the person who said they could taste baking soda... You didn't read the recipe right - it calls for a tablespoon of baking powder not soda so I feel badly for you.
4069	497	Fresh Plums and had all the rest of the ingredients.  Quick, easy, good
4070	497	I made this and it turned out so good! I didn't have milk so I used water and butter for substitute. My kids loved it! It was a good way to use up the plums we were given!
4071	497	I have made this a few time and LOVE IT. The batter recipe is excellent and can be used for many other fruit recipes. For this recipe, play with the amount of plums. I use Santa Rosa plums. 7 cups is a lot of plums and you definitely need to use a deeper pan. The cake will soak up the plum juice quickly, turning it in to a bread pudding. If you don’t like it like this, reduce the plums to 4 cups or as low as 2 cups finely chopped. I prefer to make the topping using half white and half brown sugar. If you are having trouble with your crumb topping texture, keep adding flour to your liking. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg as well. You just can’t go wrong with this!
4072	497	We have excess fruit from our two tress and came across this recipe. It's very easy to make and tastes delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream! Did however, take a lot more time to bake then what is listed in recipe.
4073	497	This is such a great recipe filled with fruit that you can taste in a moist cake. Great directions.
4074	498	Best bread I’ve made and a hit with everyone who’s tried it! The plums make it super moist and add great flavor
4075	498	Made this today per the recipe and it was AMAZING!  I was given a large amount of Italian plums from a neighbor and I had several zucchini in the garden.
4076	498	Everyone loves this recipe! I use plums that I canned and the zucchini is shredded and canned as well. Both are drained and since the plums are canned in halves, I put them in the food processor and only used 2 1/2 cups. This is a wonderful, moist bread and is always a winner.
4077	498	Added chopped walnuts the second time I made it. Delicious will make it again and again.
4078	498	I added some nutmeg based on advise of another reviewer, and because I didn't have whole wheat flour on hand, I used masa corn flour. Overall, it's just incredibly bland. It's not that sweet despite the amount of sugar added either. It's consistency is fine  - not too moist and not too dry - but I have to eat it with jam to make it palatable.
4079	498	Tasty muffins that use up all the plums we had! I substituted just over 1/3 c of oats for the whole wheat flour as I was out. Used 1 c brown sugar as per recipe and cut the white sugar down by half. Also added slightly more zucchini and plums. While still very good, given 4 stars as I only give 5 to recipes that really knock my socks off
4080	498	It was really moist! The plum is subtle. A great somewhat healthy bread.
4081	498	Delicious! Made exactly as recipe called for.  The plums take on the flavor of fresh cranberries, and it is both sweet and tart at the same time.  This is a keeper.
4082	498	So delicious! A keeper for sure.
4083	499	Paired this delicious salad with herbed lamb chops in a balsamic reduction and couscous for our Spring Equinox dinner!  It was fantastic 🤤
4084	499	I made this salad for a pre-holiday dinner party and it was a big success! Very delicious with a variety of textures and flavors. My husband said his “taste buds were dancing”. I used half spinach, half spring mix, and goat cheese, along with all the other listed ingredients. Definitely five stars!
4085	499	I love this recipe as it is so refreshing, especially after all the heavy foods at Christmas
4086	499	Great Holiday Salad. Well received and just beautiful, festive, and delicious!
4087	499	In one word: amazing!
4088	499	Very pretty salad, would be nice for a holiday potluck.
4089	499	Made this for a dinner party and it went fast. It was OK email of the easiest and tastiest salads I have had. I might try it with strawberries next time to add a little extra sweetness.
4090	499	Great flavors and so fresh.  Everyone liked it!
4091	499	I made this pretty salad for Christmas dinner. I used 15 oz of spinach, soaked the red onion slices in ice water for 15 minutes (to mellow them out), dressed the salad (using a balsamic vinaigrette recipe from this site, and then plated it. Delicious!
4120	505	I made this in a one-pot, using lamb shanks, by braising the meat on brown, then the onions. Returned meat to pot and poured over the juice, adding any other ingredients. I did not reduce the liquid and proceeded to cook on low for several hours. When the meat was tender, removed it and reduced the liquid, adding flour slurry to thicken and seasoning to taste. Served with quinoa, but would go well with rice, mashed potatoes, or noodles. Liked the fruity gravy balanced against the richness of the lamb.
4272	535	Very tasty!  Just found this recipe today and had leftover pomegranate to use so thought I would try it.  Followed recipe except used walnuts instead of Brazil nuts.  Am saving this one.
4092	500	My husband made this for me and our kids and his parents and it was delicious!! Best Mexican food I’ve ever had!! It’s even better the next day refrigerated of course and reheated!!I love goat cheese and when we saw it online we had to try it! Make sure your pomegranate seeds are fresh we read somewhere that they expire quickly so don’t add those to any that might be leftover because it said they are chewy and loose their flavor. Tidbit even we didn’t know. So I put ours only as we served the plate and the next day we used a new pomegranate!! Thanks All recipes!! By the way we LOvE Chef John on your website!! He always makes sense but his tagline ENJOY! As he says it just makes me giggle!!! It makes me smile!! Keep him on here! I love the video aspect and how he speaks!!
4093	500	Loved it!
4094	500	This recipe has good flavors and textures. The filling was a little bland so I added cumin and cayenne. It was involved but I will definitely make it again.
4095	501	Couldn't find pomegranate seeds so used craisins.  Used Chef John's cranberry mustard salad dressing from this site.
4096	501	Easy, fast, and f estive. I followed the recipe as written the first time and the second time I made it,  added some diced cucumber and avocado. My husband enjoyed the original and the variation.
4097	501	great flavor and presentation.
4098	501	I used raspberry vinaigrette because I couldn't find cranberry and added a ripe pear that I had on hand.  It was delicious!!  It looked beautiful on the table and was super-healthy because I didn't use much vinaigrette - it didn't need it.
4099	501	I made it for a Christmas potluck and should have made more, not a pomegranate seed was left. This was a winner!
4100	501	Simple and delicious with all the colors of Christmas! I made it exactly as written.  Half the amount of pomegranate seeds would be plenty. I used a cranberry vinaigrette from Aldi, which is a seasonal item. It's very versatile and you could swap out for different nuts or cheeses. Definitely making this one again!
4101	502	Delicious.  I modified the recipe by doubling the topping ingredients because my family likes that stuff.  If you tried it and didn't like it maybe you used pomegranates that weren't ripe or apples that were too tart.
4102	502	Wonderful recipe!
4103	502	The flavor was excellent, the apples had good flavor, used some peeled, some red with skin and some Granny Smith. Also used
4104	502	I used a whole pomegranate.  Great with a topping of plain yoghurt which is a good compliment to the sweetness of the Crisp. Also good with ice cream.
4105	502	My tree was full and we had a game night planned, so we took it to our good friends to sample for desert.  I enjoyed it very much, and everyone else seemed to as well.  Next time, I plan on adding roasted walnuts.
4106	502	I didn't measure anything. I just included all the ingredients & cooked as directed. It had enough moisture & was great! Served with ice cream. I had none left!
4107	502	Used Fuji apples. Turned out too sweet and heavy on cinnamon. Recommend significantly reducing sugar and cinnamon.
4108	502	Best apple crisp I had. Pomegranates were not crunchy and it has a nice slightly tart yet interesting flavor. This tasted like you would order it from a fancy restaurant.
4109	502	This was excellent. Loved the combination of apple and pomegrante. My hubby thought there was too much cinnamon but he doesn't care for cinnamon. Next time, I'll probably use half the amount of cinnamon.
4110	503	Loved this pomegranate flavor! I think I would try Sprite instead of club soda for a little bit of sweetness.
4111	504	Excellent!!! Pomegranate jelly was great.Batch #2: I added blueberries and it was great.Batch #3: I added raspberries and it was great.Batch #4: I added 2 cups of fresh lemon juice and its was everyones favorite.  😋😋😋😋😋
4112	504	Great Recipe Got A Best Of Division  Blue Ribbon At County Fair.
4113	504	Beautiful, easy and tasty jelly.  I too boiled the pectin a full minute.  I got 9 1/2-pint jars out of it.
4114	504	Good general recipe. I harvested about 6 pomegranates from my backyard bush within a week of making the jelly. This is the first year I got more than two fruits, so I was excited to make jelly. Unfortunately I only got 1 1/2 cups of clear juice, so I had to scale back the amounts stated by this recipe. I kept the same proportions though. I also used pectin extracted from 3 pounds of crab apples. Another website stated that it was a guesstimate as to how much "natural pectin" to use, so I was a little hazy  about using the proper amount. I ended up using 4 "ice cubes" of my crab apple pectin (maybe about 6 TB total?). The boiled mixture thickened slightly when I cooled it and poured into my jars. So disappointed I only filled two 8oz. jars! But I can't wait to try the jelly...it looks amazingly clear!
4115	504	I made this using fruit from the tree including fresh lemon juice. I did as suggested and put the pectin in the juice bring it to a boil for 30 seconds prior to adding the sugar.   This set up perfectly every time.
4116	504	I followed the recipe last year, got greater yield on my tree this year so I'm making it now. It's delicious and I was able to get 9 pints out of recipe but had 5 + Cups of juice. It's so fun making jelly for Christmas ??
4117	504	This is a great jelly, so easy to make. I agree, use the pectin before adding sugar. It will set very nicely. This makes a great gift because it can be used for so many things from holiday dinner to a simple toasted bagel. Yum
4118	504	We just love Pom jelly. This recipe is good, but I reduced the sugar to 4 cups, doubled the pectin.  PLENTY sweet, can still taste Pom.  Used fresh juice.  We juice ours by tossing a couple cups at a time of fresh kernels in the blender and pulse just a couple times, then strain into the cookpot with doubled cheesecloth or a tea towel.
4119	504	This jelly is good but WOW is it sweet. I have to admit when I read the reviews saying to reduce sugar I thought it was just people who don't like sweets, so I made the recipe using the full 7 1/2 cups sugar.  Dang, wow...it should definitely be reduced!  To put this in perspective for you , I literally ate cookie dough for breakfast this morning. I'm not afraid of sugar!  I added extra lemon juice to try and cut the sweetness and it helped a little, next time I'll reduce it by a cup like the suggestions said in the first place.  As other reviewers suggested I added the pectin (powdered) to the juice, boiled and the added sugars and  boiled again, it's jelling fine. Also, a jelly tip to reduce bubbles ( and skimming) add a little bit of butter right before you're ready to fill jars, the bubbles dissipate.
4150	509	Needs a cheese like feta crumbles to balance out the acidity.
4151	509	Absolutely delicious.  Relatively lot fat dressing.
4152	509	This was OK, but I've had other pear salads that I liked better. The pomegranate was a nice touch though. We found that we wanted something savory in it to balance the sweetness of the other ingredients so we added Gorgonzola cheese and crunchy onions.
4121	505	We love this as it has become our traditional Easter dinner. The sauce is amazing it's fruity with the pomegranate taking center spotlight, spicy and a touch of savoriness. the flavor profile has an exotic Mediterranean (Greek, Turkey, Persian, or Israeli )or Moroccan vibe that is gorgeous. The meat is so tender it falls off the bone and can be cut with a spoon. A gravy strainer is a must to separate the fat from the sauce quickly. The recipe also works with any red meat so if you prefer
4122	505	We ate this on Christmas and it was a great recipe!  The colors of the mint and the pomegranate made it look very colorful for the holiday.
4123	505	This is a wonderful refined recipe.  The only reason you might not like it is you just don't like lamb.  Made it exactly as written and served with couscous.  One recommendation, buy pomegranate juice, do not try to make it from pomegranates.  It took me an hour and 3 pomegranates to make 2 cups and was not worth it in my estimation.  I also feel I reduced the pomegranate mixture more than I should have before returning the lamb.  I will pay more attention the next time.  Do not skip the garnish.
4124	505	Hands down the most amazing lamb dish I have ever prepared. Thank you for this phenomenal recipe.
4125	505	This recipe is brilliant. Easy, flavourful ... The whole family loves it. I was certain I’d made enough for leftovers, but no such luck. I can’t wait to be able to serve this for company.
4126	505	I modified the recipe just a bit and made it with a leg of lamb in a slow cooker.  I raised thre lamb myself.  My wife provided the honey from our apiary.  We also provided our own home grown mint and rosemary for the recipe.  It was almost completely "Home"made and it turned out great!
4127	505	I used cranberry pomegranate juice instead of pure pomegranate and made it with pork chops, easier on the budget. I have made this several times now.
4128	505	I wasn't going to make this at first because the recipe said Dutch oven and I don't own one. Then I realized that all you need is a big pan with a lid and obviously, this could be done in a slow cooker as well!
4129	506	Made this for pulled pork I had left over. This is delicious! The pomegranate molasses gives it a sweet tart kick that is delightful.
4130	506	I'll cut back on the honey next time but it was delicious!  I used EVOO instead of Sunflower Seed Oil because seriously, who stocks that?  We dipped kettle chips in it and yum......
4131	506	This is quite delicious and super quick to throw together. It’s tangy and not too sweet. Thanks for the recipe.
4132	506	I used regular molasses and canola oil for this, only because that's what was around. LOVE it! We're an incredibly busy family (who isn't?) and it saves time to prep ahead. I've made this in a larger batch and stored it in the kitchen for a week. We've used it on roasts, burgers, & chicken. The roast went in the slow cooker with this. For the burgers, I had made sliders and left a little out as one of the sauce choices. For the chicken, we had breaded cutlets and I drizzled some over them. It's been a versatile sauce. Good stuff, thanks for posting it!
4133	506	Inspired combination.  It's now a house favourite.  This sauce is 'ace' on pork chops or pork tenderloin, roasted in the oven.  As Axel Steenberg warns, this sauce can burn after 30-45 minutes so watch closely.  I'm a great fan of pomegranate molasses.  I picked it up 'on spec' at the neighbourhood Middle Eastern grocery.
4134	506	This was delicious! The pomegranate molasses added another dimension to an otherwise traditional BBQ sauce! I added more fresh ground black pepper as a preference and used agave nectar instead of honey, and EVOO instead of sunflower oil.
4135	507	This dressing is 5 Stars!!Used pomegranate syrup and exactly followedExcept didn’t use blender I whisked and wow!!Dressing or dip excellent flavors on cucumbers tomatoes and sliced red onion!I will dip my French bread tomorrow!
4136	507	My salad was the hit of the party.  I made a beet salad with arugula and goat cheese.  This  dressing gave it the finish it needed.
4137	507	I've made this many, many times. Good basic recipe and way to use excess pomegranates in fall and winter by juicing.
4138	507	I used to have a fabulous pomegranate dressing recipe which I misplaced so I tried this as a replacement. To me, the proportions on this recipe aren't quite right. The vinegar was way too strong. I made the recipe as written, then made a lot of tweaks to get it the right taste for our family. My recommendations: Cut the vinegar to 1/2 cup and increase the pomegranate juice to 1-1/2 cups. (I reduced 2 cups pomegranate juice on the stove to about 1 cup reduction in a subsequent attempt at this recipe and liked it even better so you may play with the pomegranate juice.) I increased the shallot, garlic, and pepper and used about 2 tsp. salt. I've also tried replacing the sugar with honey and find I like that better as well. Thanks for the recipe, Mel. It's a good starter base for a good dressing.
4139	507	Delicious salad dressing for the Rosh Hashanah meal. I added a few tablespoons of  fresh pomegranate seeds and used 4 Tbs honey instead of white sugar.
4140	507	Very good! Will definitely make again and again.
4141	507	I made this amazing dressing and had it on a salad of mixed greens,  strawberries,  dried cranberries,  gorgonzola,  and candied pecans.  So so amazing!!
4142	507	I decided to copycat Wendy's Apple Pecan Chicken Salad, which is amazing, and I used this recipe for the dressing. It's better than the dressing that comes in the packets with the Wendy's salad. It separates very quickly, so it's important to shake it every time. I love the tangy,  sweet sour vibe of this vinaigrette. And so easy!
4143	507	This was good, but I felt like it was missing something. I might tweak it a bit next time.
4144	508	I loved this. It took a lot longer than 20 minutes for my long grain rice to cook but I used brown rice.
4145	508	I always love an excuse to use saffron, and this delicious rice was a great use for it. Easy to make, too, exactly as described.
4146	508	Wonderful, tasty rice recipe and a great way to use up a pomegranate (we have a tree). The only change I made was to use homemade chicken broth because we had some on hand. Will definitely make this rice again and again!
4147	509	I need to learn an easier way to remove the pomegranate seeds.  I made no changes the first time and it was decent but tonight, I'm going to add a little gorgonzola cheese to see if that punches it up.
4148	509	It was awesome. Added goat cheese and candied pecan. And used 2/3 lemon juice. Must eat right away
4149	509	I've made a few times and love it.  But adding now b/c of necessary mods this evening... thought I had a pomegranate - but didn't.  So... used (pure) cranberry juice for dressing, then added more pear for crunch.   Threw some pear slices into dressing while boiling.  Also added some cotija cheese - mostly b/c I had it - and it made dressing smoother.  Good! Moral being - this is really good recipe open to changes!
4303	541	Delicious and easy to make!
4153	509	I liked the pear and pomegranate flavor combination.  You really need a fairly strong green.  I used romaine, but I think it would be better with spinach (unfortunately one of our guests can't eat spinach).  My disappointment was with the salad dressing.  It just didn't pack much of a punch.  The mustard in the dressing was a nice touch, but in the end it was a little bland.
4154	509	I added a bit more mustard to the dressing,  and topped with some feta cheese.  This was a real hit at Thanksgiving. My husband wants it at Christmas, too ??
4155	509	Easy to make and very refreshing. Will definitely make it again.
4156	510	I used a frozen antioxidant blend instead of all the juices. I think this added the smoothie qualities and thickness that people were looking for. I really liked it
4157	510	Was good!
4158	510	Very breakfasty - In the future I will use less cinnamon and oats
4159	510	Didnt like it found it tasted like runny cold blueberry oatmeal.
4160	510	I tried this recipe and I too found it on the thin side for my taste. I used a cup of frozen blueberries and a frozen banana to thicken it. I also used raw honey to sweeten. For a change up you can substitute cranberry juice for the pomegranate juice.
4161	510	Delicious! Add other things such as flax and other fruits.
4162	510	It was ok, I added some ice cubes and that helped A lot with the texture.
4163	510	A smoothie has to have some thickness and texture, and this recipe calls for no frozen fruit or ice, so in that respect, it’s not really a smoothie to me, just a fruit-yogurt drink.  I did add quite a bit of crushed ice which didn’t dilute the flavor it too badly, used vanilla Greek yogurt and  pomegranate-blueberry juice (both what I had on hand) and was quite happy with the taste.  As I always do with smoothies that have oatmeal, I first ground/pulverized the oats in the blender and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Pretty good, but it does either need frozen blueberries or ice IMO and at least for me, I'll cut the cinnamon in half if I make this again.
4164	510	Okay, this was interesting. It was not quite thick like other smoothies I make. It tasted like blueberry yogurt juice. Only changes I made was using frozen blueberries and cutting the amount of sweetener in half and it was plenty. Not a smoothie I would make again, as it was too thin for my taste and I am just not a fan of smoothies with more than a couple of Tablespoons of yogurt. However, it's healthy enough to get me through the afternoon. ty
4165	511	It lacked flavor. Just tasted like lightly flavored sugar water actually. I might try upping the juice and boiling it down for a longer period of time.
4166	511	The real deal! I used fresh pomegranate juice. If you read the ingredients list of grenadine, you will shiver. Use this splendid mix of natural ingredients. You’ll be happy you did.
4167	511	I'm surprised that pomegranate juice made this taste just like grenadine, which is mixed berry. :) Loved it, so easy, and thank you! Our favorite thing to make with grenadine. Shirley Temples.
4168	511	This has replaced the standard grenadine at my bar.  We have not had a problem and it saves us money.
4169	511	I didn't think it was bad at all. LOTS OF SUGAR!! WOW! But my kids didn't know if they liked it. They like shirley temples... they said it tasted different then the store boughten. May not make it again.
4170	512	I LOVE this recipe and so does the whole entire family. It gets requested to be made, Great for the holidays on the table or buffet. I follow the recipe as written with two small alterations. I leave the skin on my pears and I cut back on the brown sugar a little bit ~25%. This is a keeper, thank you Misslisa!
4171	512	Nutmeg overwhelmed other flavors. Tasted like uncooked pie filling. Such a waste of a delicious pomegranate!
4172	512	I made it the day before and by day of serving guests, pears were a bit browner than I hoped with sugar more visible than would have liked.
4173	512	This is a delicious, light fruit salad.  I made it exactly as written and will make it again.
4174	512	I didn't make any changes and I had no problem with the pomegranate seeds because my store sells them separately.
4175	512	Wonderful!  I made this as a vegan dessert for my family at Christmas and everyone raved about it.  Even my husband loved it and he is not often impressed with vegan dishes.  The blend of flavors is perfect.  I will be making this again!!
4176	512	Very fresh. Good as a side salad or a dessert.
4177	512	I liked the idea of this dessert because it is so much healthier than other desserts, but the flavors just didn't come together that well for me. I am curious whether it could be cooked and served warm - I think that might help!
4178	512	Perfect for Thanksgiving-beautiful fall colors and cinnamon flavor. Works as a salad or as a healthy dessert alternative.
4179	513	First time making sweet potato biscuits and they were wonderful!! My family and friends loved them as well. Thank you Chef John…🙃
4180	513	These were tasty to the extreme. I recommend them to anyone seeking delicious food. I paired them with some vegetarian chili. They were a little bit more labor intensive compared to other carb-side options such as cornbread but well worth the effort. These also require a bit of preplanning to ensure ingredients are cooled properly in time for the final pre-baking steps. Again, well worth the effort!
4181	513	It's nearing summer in Brazil, sweet potatoes are not in season, so I used mandioquinhas instead. And I used coconut milk instead of buttermilk, which isn't easy to find around here no matter the season. Grating frozen butter was not easy in this heat, I had to be really quick so the pieces wouldn't melt in my hand, and I ended up bruising my fingers badly. The results were totally worth it, though. My whole family loved it. Will try again when winter comes, this time with actual sweet potatoes.
4182	513	The best thing about these biscuits. . . Heating them up and smearing them with butter and honey for breakfast the next day!
4183	513	I never worry that a Chef John recipe is going to be less than perfect, and this one is a case in point. Minor adjustments I made: I increased the amounts by 50%; I made ersatz buttermilk with whole milk and lemon juice; I followed John's instructions on making self-rising flour; and I skipped the pomegranate spread. Froze most of the yield to be brought out on Christmas. Really delicious recipe, John!
4184	513	Really liked this recipe!  Made it as mini size and probably won't do that again.  It was good, but lost some of the "biscuit" texture.  I made it as is, but w/o the pomegranate butter.  My office loved them!  Plan to make again and might up the sweet potato & add some cinn/sugar topping, just cause I love it!
4185	513	Two words, Da bomb!!  Made no changes to the recipe.  That being said, we did not make the Pomegranate Spread.  And yes, we will make these again and again!
4186	513	Made this recipe as written......it is phenomenal!!
4187	513	This recipe is a show stopper. Follow it exactly. There used to be a video. It was extremely helpful. These biscuits come out moist and delicious and are perfect for leftovers ham cranberry and dressing sandwiches at thanksgiving
4188	515	Light, gorgeous, delicious.  Loved it as did the dinner party.  I added some berries and diced papaya for color and it was a hit!  Turned out perfect!
4189	516	This is delicious! Proportions are perfect. Everybody loved it!
4190	516	A very fun and simple recipe! Get the brunch ready and serve these for the party.
4191	517	I make this recipe every year and it is a guaranteed hit!  I have people ask for the recipe whenever we serve it.  It is the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted!
4192	517	I made it again and of course, changed it up again.  (I am Alice C, the original poster of this recipe) THIS year I subbed 1/2 cup of PORT WINE and 1/2 cup OJ for the 1 cup orange juice. (or whatever type of liquid you use) and I added 1 pint of fresh raspberries once the relish was finished cooking.  I use the same amt of spices every year because WE LIKE IT "spicy".  I also had to make the pomegranate version as well, and NO, the pom seeds are not supposed to "get soft" as a couple ppl mentioned that theirs didn't. The point of the pom seeds if you use them is that they ADD A CRUNCH to this sauce.  :)  As long as you keep the liquid/cranberries in the same proportion and follow the directions for cooking this, you can do whatever you want with this "recipe". Few spices? Fine. Booze for liquid? Try it! Grated citrus zest....yes, please! Added fruits? Sure!  Last year I made some with 1 cup of apple juice and chopped up an apple to add plus stirred in some toasted walnuts at the end. THAT was really good!
4193	517	The flavors worked well together. I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I used a little ground cinnamon to taste. While l liked the taste of pomegranate, I didn't like the crunch of the seeds in the sauce. More a texture issue for me than anything else.
4194	517	I submitted this as "Alice C" quite some time ago. I tend to change it up from time to time. ;)
4195	517	This is a great recipe; especially over Thanksgiving turkey! You might need to make a double batch though, people eat it up quick!
4196	517	I love this recipe, although I've changed it slightly. I use the juice from one pomegranate, rather than the seeds and replace the cinnamon sticks with a little grated nutmeg. For the pomegranate juice you can either buy it bottled or smash the pomegranate seeds up with a reasonably large mortar and pestle.
4197	517	I found this recipe many years ago and it has become a tradition in our house at Thanksgiving.  My whole family loves it, including my kids who look forward to it.  My favorite part of the recipe is the ground cloves and cinnamon.  The spices add so much flavor and smell so good while cooking!  The pomegranate adds texture and a little crunch.  If you are looking for something bland or mild, this is not the recipe for you.  If you are looking for something bold and packed full of flavor, you will love it!  Thank you for posting this fabulous recipe!
4198	517	so the pomegranate seeds never really got soft but I think that's my fault. Really hindered the final product.
4199	517	Go ahead and double this recipe, since it's sure to be polished off. I left out the cloves and used half the sugar for a sweet-tart sauce in which all the flavors really shine without being overpowered by the spices.
4200	518	There are 2 types of Fesenjan, sour and sweet. I like the sour one better. If you are like me skip adding sugar and enjoy the sour taste
4201	518	This was very good!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (left the chicken drumsticks whole) and it turned out great! The chicken was very tender, and practically fell off the bone. It's a nice sweet and savoury dish that goes well over rice. I'll make no changes to this dish the next time I make it, it's perfect as is.
4202	518	Amazing flavor and texture. My kids gobble it down. Made a substitution of 1 part cinnamon and 1 part ginger since I couldn't find cardamom in my local grocery store. Making it again tonight for dinner!
4203	518	I make this dish whenever I get the chance. Using full pomegranate juice defintely results in a tart end product, but the sugar and spices really work well with it. I generally use drumsticks, but boneless/skinless thighs reduce the work and chicken breast can be cooked with it a little later in the process (so they don't dry out). Sometimes I add a little cinnamon/ground cloves as well. Paired with rice and/or flatbread and some plain yogurt it makes a fantastic meal. Everyone who has tried it has raved and asked for the recipe. Can also be converted to a crockpot cooking method, though the flavors don't seem to come through as well. Leftovers are also very good. Just an all-around winner!
4204	518	This was absolutely delicious. I used chicken thighs and substituted 4 whole green cardamom pods for the 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I also added 2 cups of  fresh carrot chunks, which nicely balanced the tartness of the pomegranate juice (instead of using sugar).  The sauce didn't thicken sufficiently for my taste so I boiled it down to the desired thickness.
4205	518	I've always loved fesenjan but had no idea it'd be so simple to make. This turned out great! Thank you!
4206	518	AWESOME!! I make this receipe almost every week.
4207	518	I substituted two cans of whole chickpeas for the chicken and it came out as a really nice vegetarian meal.
4208	518	I made this last night.  My sauce did turn out a nice brown color. I used chicken thighs (took the skin off).  I am wondering when reading other's reviews if they did not use PURE pomegranate juice? Maybe this is why it was too sweet or an odd color!? Omitted the sugar as well.  It can be confusing because in the Juice shelves of most grocery stores there will be "Pomegranate Juice 100% Juice" but it's mostly grape juice and other fruit juices!  What I did is get 2 pomegranates and juice them myself, so that was time consuming to do. I had to look up a Youtube video "How to Juice a Pomegranate"  Anyway, the juice was tart and gave the dish a good flavor. 2 pomegranates = 1.5 C of juice and I did use Organic chicken broth 3/4 C of that.  Great suggestion from others!   I added to my liking in addition to the Cardamom: 1/2 tsp of Tumeric, and I also seeded a small Serrano pepper and tossed that in whole to give the dish some heat.  I liked my additions, it was super good over Indian Basmati Rice!   Another reviewer suggested shredding the chicken off the bone and I did that right in the saucepan after it had been simmering for an hour or so.  It was  unique, very flavorful. I also made the Persian Cucumber Yogurt salad and got some store bought Wood Fired Naan flatbread to go with it.  YUM.  I only gave it 4 stars because the time consuming issue of the pomegranates and not finding the juice in the store, so this recipe might not be very convenient for some people to make.
4209	519	Excellent recipe, but directions were terrible, and I could barely tell what you were supposed to do at what time.
4210	519	I loved this recipe and will never ever eat canned cranberry sauce! I added Blueberries to make it sweeter, it helped to take some of the bitterness away.
4217	519	This sauce was delicious! We added some raspberries and strawberries left over in the fridge. Instead of pomegranate juice we used apple cider and omitted the pecans. After the sauce was cooked and ready we took all the seeds left over and make some yummy tea. Two dishes in one! Great recipe!
4218	520	Great flavor but beware - it’s really spicy hot, so you may want to cut out at least 1/2 a tsp of the chipotle chili powder & maybe use real milk instead of almond to cut through the heat.
4219	520	Decent 3.5 stars
4220	520	This recipe worked great for our dinner party.  Only point is you might have to mix in water and then heat in a pot to produce the amount needed (as this depends on how ch squash you started with).  But very tasty and will make again soon.
4221	522	This was good. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find harissa so I used Sambal Olek instead. The resulting dressing was not as spicy as I’d hoped, but the recipe should not be blamed for my substitution. I also stirred in some arugula for extra interest, which I think was a good addition. The pan-fried halloumi was delicious!
4222	523	Flakey and yummy, watch cooking time, easy to overcook.
4223	524	Our Daughter in-law loves salads. For her 40th birthday, my wife came up with the idea and committed to making 2 salads a week for a total of 40 salads. We did a  fairly extensive search and accumulation of a wide variety of salads. when my wife made up the salads, she would make 4 so we all could try them. 4 weeks in the reviews were moderate to good. Then we came to this recipe: Hands down 5 stars from all especially from me.
4224	524	This salad had mixed reviews in my house. My husband thought that there was a flavor that did not go well but could not say which one. I thought it was okay but it still needed something. I think it may be the dressing. It was rather "watery" and a little bit went a long way.
4225	525	wish ZERO stars was an option, because that is the only proper option when the ingredient ration is absolutely incorrect. Followed the instructions perfectly even though they seemed unlikely. My ice cream maker never failed until this batch. Had to throw out very expensive ingredients over a mistake the author won't correct.
4226	525	Very yummy and my family loved it. I definitely doubled the heavy cream.
4227	525	Excellent, Excellent, Excellet, but for sure this is 2 cups of cream... I also added a 2 diced fresh peaches at the end of the soft serve stage...  loved this as did our dinner guest.
4228	525	Tried it and it was delicious!
4229	525	Made this for a dinner party and did not set up at all!  Good thing my guests had a sense of humor and that we had cookies for dessert instead.  Next time will try suggestion to double cream.
4230	525	I mixed up the ice cream ingredients according to the recipe and put it in the ice cream maker. It just would not freeze, and we suspected that the ratio of sugar to everything else was off, which would make it harder to freeze. I ended up doubling the cream. I worried that it might make it have too little flavor, but it was still very good, and it froze very nicely after I added the extra cream.
4231	525	A simple ice-cream recipe n very delicious.I substitute cherry juice for pomegrante n it was great,i like the fact that you can use almost any of your favourite juices n it will come out great.Thumbs up to Peaches n her boys i suspect u won with this!!!!
4232	526	Loved this recipe -- used a very low alcohol content rose -- very flavorful, and we just used it on pancakes!! Family was impressed :) Nice recipe!!
4233	526	SOOO good! I added more raw sugar. I had people ask for the recipe.
4234	526	This recipe concept was exactly what I was looking for to add color to my fall fruit tart. The problem is, it didn't quite turn to syrup and based on the previous reviews. I've made syrups before wish sugar but they usually contain less liquid from the beginning. That might be the key. Otherwise, the flavor is perfect.
4235	526	I also had trouble getting a syrup consistency.  The flavor is pretty good.  The nutmeg is a little overpowering, so next time, I will not add as much.
4236	526	This has great flavor, but it didn't quite set up as a syrup. I'm pretty sure that was user error, though--my brown sugar was hard as a brick, so I had trouble  measuring the pieces I sawed off; I just added till I thought it was sweet enough, and I don't think I used the full amount. I added some fresh grape juice to the pomegranate (about 15 grapes to six poms), which may have cut the tartness a bit, and I used fresh ginger. Nice, spicy flavor!
4237	527	I used pomegranate syrup instead of making it myself to cut down effort/time. You can buy it at middle eastern grocery stores. Great combo of flavors!
4238	527	not good
4239	527	This was okay. I used POM pomegranate juice instead of making it myself. I wanted the sauce to be a little thicker, so next time I will modify it. The different components blended well together and tasted great, but not as strong as I'd have liked. This is a keeper, but I will make adjustments to the recipe for next time.
4240	527	Family LOVED this! Instead of making my own sauce out of fresh pomegranate, I used pomegranate juice (as that was in fridge). I still reduced it with sugar, balsamic vinegar, and cinnamon, but used a a whole teaspoon of cinnamon because we love cinnamon. I braised the pieces of pork shoulder on the stovetop in about a tablespoon of olive oil. Then I coated the pieces with the sauce and cooked them in my pressure cooker for 40 minutes. It came out flavorful and fell apart in tender strips. I would definitely make this again!
4241	527	Loved this recipe.
4242	527	Exceptional!!! I did use the crock pot as suggested by Sherri's review, and I had pomegranate juice so I used that suggestion too. My honey loves garlic, so I upped that.  I love the sauce, and next time will play with fresh herbs.
4243	527	DELICIOUS!! & Pork shoulder are the BEST roast (was a meat cutter for yrs). A MUST try! Not a lot of work at all.  Everyone loved it.
4244	527	OK let's just say I waited until I was 57 to start cooking.  I liked what I read about this recipe, but reading a few reviews there was talk of wishing the pomegranate sauce went deeper into the roast.  First I used 1/2 C POM juice and 1/2 C water - rather than going through the cooking of the pomegranate - I reduced it, but before it hit a glaze consistency, I loaded my turkey injector and shot the roast through with the juice.  I poured some over the roast, then saved the rest - adding it to a brown gravy mix to serve over rice - gravy from scratch is above my pay grade.
4245	527	yummy.  I made extra pomegranate sauce
4246	528	If making this recipe more than a day in advance wait until just before serving to add the pomegranate seeds. The vinegar will dissolve the seeds.
4247	529	Really bland and unexciting
4248	529	Very good. Substituted farro for the freekeh.  The grocery store was out of all things pomegranate so used blackberries, which were good but the pomegranate seeds would have been better.
4250	530	Beautiful and delicious! I didn't have a red onion, so I used sweet onion. Used 'Horseradish Vinaigrette' from this site for the dressing w/ a bit of honey added to compliment the sweet fruits. This would also be great w/ some crumbled blue cheese added, which I will try next time. Thanks for sharing. :)
4251	530	I leave out the mandarin, add some parmesan flakes and balsamic vinegar/cream and it's delicious.
4252	531	I presented it for an healthy sidepiece today for child guidance on what kids should eat when they need something to fill their stomachs.
4253	531	To me, the pomegranates and the shallots just didn't complement each other. The seeds, which I pretty much expected, were just too crunchy and "raw" tasting. I should have just sprinkled whole pomegranate seeds on my salad.
4254	531	This salsa is awesome. It is like a party in your mouth with all of the different flavors, and the lime tortilla chips are the perfect accompaniment. I am not fond of Italian Parsly so left it out and did not miss it.
4255	531	I forgot to cook anything at all. I did not juice the pomegranate either, just took the seeds out and added the rest of the stuff. Nothing was left! Even my 2 year old loved it. Thanks for a novel idea of serving pomegranate.
4256	531	I have not made this recipe yet but I have an easy way to seed a pomegranate.  I carefully take off the top of the pomegranate without hitting the seeds.  With a very sharp knife I score the fruit into quarters again without cutting too deep.  In a  large deep bowl,  take the pomegranate and pull apart over the bowl.  Take each quarter and place it skin side up in one hand with your fingers open.  In your other hand, take a wooden spoon and whack the skin side of the pomegranate.  The seeds just fall out.  Don't be afraid to hit fairly hard.  You will be amazed how quickly the seeds fall out and the rind just stays on the skin.  You may have to still pick a few seeds out but this is so simple.  Have fun!!
4257	531	good relish... a good way to get the seeds out, I cut the pomegranate in half and fill a large bowl with cold water and break apart the pieces in the water and push out the seeds with my thumbs as I break it all apart.. the rind and white pieces will float, while the seeds go to the bottom. Scoop off the white stuff and rinse seeds in collander, doing a final cleaning and throw seeds on a couple paper towels. saw this on "Good Eats" w/ Alton Brown
4258	531	I was really excited to try this because I love pomegranate and I had six on them sitting on my sink. I used the suggestion of an old fashioned crank grinder to get the juice out and all I got was a mess and crushed seeds. I ended up using a hand citrus juicer, which still made a big mess. Between prep and cleanup it took a good hour to make and then it was just okey with baked chicken. That night both my husband and I had "intestinal issues". Needless to say I won't be making it again. A big disappointment.
4259	531	Great with Thanksgiving dinner and a great alternative for diabetics.  I used parsley instead of cilantro because a bunch of us don't like cilantro.  I didn't juice the pomegranate and just used the seeds.  I wish I had juiced it or ground the seeds because the seeds were a bit cruncy.  Finally, if you are seeding a pomegranate yourself, it will take a lot longer than the stated 5 minutes!  I think it took me 30min to get the seeds out of the pomegranates (though  maybe there is a faster technique)!
4260	531	Pomagranates are not items we find in our town store but when they did have it and I found yours recipe ..we asked the store owner if he could get more ..but alas no way ..but when he would get them he would let us know....We thank you for sharing this with us for it was great and yummy on any kind of meat...
4261	532	This came out really tasty, will definitely be making again. I used a whole chicken and baked in a dutch oven.
4262	532	I've never eaten this dish before, so I don't really have a set idea of what it is supposed to taste like.  However, I love trying new foods and was interested in seeing what this would turn out like.  I thought it was interesting although not sure I'm a huge fan.  Hubs was not a fan at all and wanted to know where the other leftovers were.  He ate this but wasn't thrilled.  I'm thinking his dislike stems from the cardamom, which he hasn't really seemed to like in any dish.  I'm also willing to admit this could totally be my fault that we didn't like it--I did leave out the saffron because I'm not interested in using an expensive spice just for the color.  I love saffron for the flavor.  However, I did base that decision on the one review that mentioned it, so perhaps if I'd kept it in we would've enjoyed it more.  Thanks for the recipe!
4263	532	This is mighty tasty! WOW. So impressed with it. Even just the walnuts and pomegranate mixture in the first steps was amazing! (I might just use it as a PB&J replacement once in a while) ;-)
4264	532	This tastes good....but I find the texture odd with the granules of walnuts still somewhat intact (though I ground them in my food processor).  And as the other person mentioned, it's not such an attractive dish.  But again, it tastes good.  Be sure to serve it alongside a colorful dish (such as a nice salad) to "spruce it up" color-wise!
4265	532	a lot of work to prepare.  family only liked it.  I loved it
4266	532	Great, easy fesen joon recipe. I am Iranian & used this recipe several times, well received by all.
4267	532	I wasn't sure if I liked this at first but it does grow on you as you eat it. It has an unusual taste. I replaced the pomegranate juice with a tablespoon of pomegranate molasses. I omitted the squash (didn't have any) and it still tasted very good.
4268	532	I don't want to give this a bad rating, because I absolutely LOVE persian food, and my friends and I will drive 45 minutes to go to this restaurant that prepares a similiar dish.  However, for some reason it didn't work.  I tasted the sauce and it seemed fine before I put it in the oven, but after two hours, it looked and tasted gross.  There was no flavour and I couldn't taste the saffron at all.  I'm pretty sure that I did something wrong, as this recipe is fantastic in Persian restaurants.
4269	532	This dish is absolutely amazing!  This is supposed to be a very difficult Persian dish to make and it was my first time ever making the dish, but the recipe is so straight-forward and easy to follow.  I used eggplant instead of squash because I didn't have squash and I had seen eggplants in other recipes for Fesenjoon and it worked perfectly.
4270	533	I used mixed greens since I don’t like kale. Also had walnuts so I used those.  A pretty and tasty salad!
4271	534	11.5.16  Followed the directions as written, and I did add the optional sliced olives (which I would do again).   Just a little bit on the salty side for me (but then I did add olives), so I’ll cut that amount to 1/4 tsp in the future.  You get a little crunch from the cabbage, a pop of sweetness from the pomegranate seeds, and those olive slices add a bit of saltiness to the potatoes.  The dressing was perfectly balanced. I'm not sure if you'd call this a salad or a potato side dish.  Whatever, it was good!   farah,  thanks for sharing.  *****UPDATE 11.7.16*****  FYI in case you're interested, we ate this both chilled and warm, and preferred it warm.
4273	536	I love kale salads, but this one missed the mark for me.  Props for the massaging step, as that is essential for making a great kale salad. The dressing definitely needed some salt, and why not just add the cinnamon to the dressing instead of sprinkling it on the kale? I measured everything out exactly, and for 10 ounces of kale, there wasn't nearly enough dressing. This was a very dry salad. I would double the dressing. I'd also add a touch of sweetness to it, such as raw honey, as the dressing is very tangy.  I felt this could have used some cheese, such as crumbled feta or goat cheese. That said, the salad was very colorful and I loved the addition of the thyme and cinnamon. This makes HUGE portions...more like 5 or 6 instead of 3.
4274	537	doubled recipe. added extra half T of butter, T of honey, dash or so of ginger, fresh ground pepper, salt
4275	537	11.1.16  I steamed the carrots in the microwave for 2 minutes and then they went into the skillet with the butter.  I added the OJ and pomegranate juice, and I agree with the first reviewer in that the OJ dominated.  I added more pomegranate juice and let it cook down, and served with some fresh pomegranate seeds that I had on hand (so we really DID taste the pomegranate flavor).  If I were to make again, I’d DECREASE the OJ by 50% and INCREASE the pomegranate juice by 50%.  It was a totally different and new flavor for carrots.  Katie, thanks for sharing.
4276	537	I didn't find that the pom juice lent any of its flavor to this. It mostly just tasted like oj. Family weren't overly thrilled with them either. I cooked them for at least 20 minutes and still weren't really tender yet. Even though it's meant to be healthy it would benefit from a little sweetening.

4278	538	This wasn't bad but it's not the world's best in my opinion.  The best I ever made was a recipe I found in the December 2001 issue of Gourmet.  I took that one to a few parties and came home with an empty bowl.
4279	538	I don't typically like fruit in salad, salsa, and guacamole, but this was FANTASTIC! The sweet tartness of the pomegranate accompanies the avocado perfectly!
4280	539	I used dried cranberries and pecans and turned out great!
4281	539	Great recipe, the only thing I did differently was use 1/2 a cup of sugar.  Overall the bread is delicious and it was so easy to make ...thank you.
4282	539	i used this as a guide, doubled the recipe for 2 loaves, didn't have nuts, used cranberries...
4283	539	I made two of those (had a lot of persimmons) I used 1/8th of a cup of sugar for a double batch, it came out perfect.
4284	539	Yummy.  Used Japanese persimmons (Fuyu) as we have so many.  Cut up some of the almost soft fruit and added to the batter.  Nice additional texture.
4285	539	This was a good use of two very ripe hachia persimmons, which are super sweet and jelly-like inside if they are very ripe. I used organic sugar that is coarser and darker than regular white sugar. I used three smaller pans and filled them pretty full. If I were to make it again, I might use a little more cinnamon, but it was still quite tasty when made according to the recipe.  Delicious and moist!
4286	539	No the recipe is perfect !
4287	539	Very good. Super easy. I added walnuts.
4288	539	It tastes great but it doesn't take 75 minutes! Only takes 30!
4289	540	Love this bread! We have a persimmon tree and I freeze pulp to make it through out the year!
4290	540	Really good basic recipe. My twist was adding no white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead, and using whole wheat flour as one of the three cups of flour. It still came out moist and delicious.
4291	540	Wondering what to do with all those wonderful persimmons? This recipe is great! Makes a delicious dense loaf, easy to slice. I doubled the recipe and made 3 regular size loaves. Since I'm diabetic I cut the sugar to 1 cup for the double batch - you couldn't tell there was any sugar missing. Adding this recipe to my collection but will make it with 1/4 cup sugar per single batch.
4292	540	Made this recipe as written, with the exception of pecans instead of walnuts, bc that's how we roll in Georgia.  Also used locally grown persimmons so I'm not exactly sure what kind they were (I think Fuyu) but they were so ripe, had I not read that they would be okay to use, I would have thrown them out.  This a very sweet bread, I'd classify as dessert.  I think cutting some of the sugar wouldn't hurt it at all.  Four large persimmons netted us 3.5 cups of pulp which we blended in 2 smoothie cups.  Probably would have been 4 cups, but my daughter didn't scrape the skins as well as I did.  I only had larger or smaller loaf pans than specified, so this recipe made two 8 x 4 loaves.  We have 2.5 cups of persimmon pulp left over so we will be making more!
4293	540	I use this recipe every year for my holiday baking. I can get about 3 dozen muffins out of a batch,  2 dozen and 1 loaf or 4-6 mini loaves, depending on the size. I've tried making it with Splenda instead of sugar, but tou need adjust the ratio to 1/2 to 3/4 cup Splenda instead of 1 cup. The artificial sweetener tasye overtakes the persimmons!
4294	540	This is excellent bread! I read some of the reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit. As follows:
4295	540	This was delicious!  I substituted with a blend of coconut flour and nut flour blend for the flour. I used our toaster oven with my mini cupcake trays, and mini loaf pan trays.  Same temperature though 20-25 min for the cupcakes. About 45 min for the mini ceramic loaf pans.
4296	540	Really yummy. I did take advice from other posts and altered it slightly. I used 1 1/2 cups persimmon purée, omitted the water and used 1 cup granulated sugar and one cup of light brown sugar (not packed) instead of three cups of granulated sugar.
4297	540	Made it!!  It was sooo delicious!!!
4298	541	I had a surplus of Fuyu persimmons and this recipe caught my eye right away! I made a few adjustments including adding a bit more cinnamon, mixing the persimmons with the sugar mixture in a bowl before assembling the pie, and I added a full top crust. The pie fell apart very easily and looked more like a cobbler when serving, but I only let it cool for an hour. And it was delicious. Tastes very similar to an apple pie! I will be making this again.
4299	541	Fuyu persimmon slices stayed hard.  I did cutouts like the main picture and even though the juices were bubbling over after 1 hr 20 min not really done.  Runny even though I threw in 1 T corn starch plus the flour.  Epic fail!
4300	541	This pie really needs to be par-baked or the bottom gets soggy. I also think the filling could have used a bit of corn starch to hold it together.
4301	541	I have never eaten persimmons and decided to try this recipe.  It was pronounced a winner by my 9 year old grandson
6944	877	Love it. Sweet with out being too sweet and fast and easy to make!
4304	541	GREAT, SIMPLE RECIPE ! THE FRUIT IS NATURALY SWEET. WITH BUTTER AND SUGAR, HOW CAN IT BE BAD ? THE ONLY WAY IT COULD BE BETTER IS IF I COULD WRAP IN BACON AND FRY IT !!
4305	541	Simple, and delicious! Much better, in my opinion, that the typical pureed persimmon fillings, which always seem "thin" in flavor, this is buttery-persimmony but the lemon juice keeps it from being too rich or cloying.
4306	542	This is my first time making persimmon jam.  I used very ripe Hachiya (soft) persimmons. Added in baking soda which was fascinating as it went from liquid to slightly gelled.  The jam turned out overly sweet.  I'll try it again, but cut the sugar way back if the persimmons are ripe. Possibly 1/4 the sugar is all that's needed.
4307	542	I used brown sugar instead of white, came out delicious!  It’s a keeper for me
4308	542	First off, this is significant, I use Fuyu persimmons. They're a highly astringent variety, which means they have to be over ripened. I then scrape the pulp out into a container and freeze it because they never ripen at the same time. If you're lucky and they do, then you can skip freezing them.I only had enough persimmons for 3/4 recipe. I inadvertantly added the full amount for the rest of the ingredients. I also added a dash of cinnamon and a tiny pinch of cloves. It turned out delicious! I then used the persimmon jam in rugelach . Also, I cook it for longer than this recipe says to.I want to can it some day, however, like tomatoes, the high acidity level means a water bath isn't the way to go.
4309	542	Horrible recipe. The jam didn't set and the resulting slop was overly acid and bitter. It wasn't the very ripe (Hachiya) persimmons because they were sweet when raw. Next time I'll use a conventional pectin recipe!
4310	542	tasty jam  I am going to use  it to fill cookies
4311	543	Tried this but, way too much half and half. It totally diluted the tasted of the persimmon.  Also will bake the pie crust too.   If I make this again, I will just one cup of half and half.
4312	543	The custard was way too sweet, but cooked fine when prepared as indicated.  However, you must blind bake a crust in which you are cooking custard.  I followed the directions exactly and ended up with cooked custard, but a doughy, undercooked crust.  I used a French tart pan, and also had lots of custard left  over.
4313	543	Turned out great..we are so happy with this easy Peasy recipe..taste wonderful !
4314	543	Simple recipe, but impossible without a few changes as the reviewers suggested. Don't add 2 whole cups of half and half--a 1/2 cup of liquid is fine--and don't add ANY sugar at all if your persimmons are ripe/sweet enough. Also took longer to cook than advertised, but the filling continues to cook/deflate after it's "done."
4315	543	i changed a few things in the recipe from the get go and it turned out great.
4316	543	I had to add 1 teaspoon of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of flour to the filling to make it not like a soup
4317	543	This custard pie was so easy to make and delicious! A wonderful addition to my fall pie repertoire. I received so many persimmons from family and a friend with trees her in Southern California.
4318	543	The typo on half and half throws cooks off as you can read in other reviews. It should be 1/2 cup of half n half and the recipe works or use condensed milk.  I also add 1 tsp cornstarch. 2 tbl melted butter and 1 tsp lemon juice with pinch of salt to round out flavor and texture in the mix.
4319	543	This is really a 5 Star recipe with just a few tweaks.
4320	544	This is my first time making this. We absolutely loved it.  Great recipe, not "wet" like I have had from other people.  Got the fruit from my own tree which made it a very satisfying endeavor.
4321	544	My grandma had a persimmon tree in her yard. She used to gather the persimmons and make pudding. She didn’t have a recipe she wrote down, she just knew it by heart. This recipe tastes so close to what she made! The consistency, texture, and taste of this recipe are near perfection!
4322	544	I made this and it was great! Glad to have a good recipe for persimmons.
4323	544	This recipe was tasty but the amount of flour in this recipe is completely wrong. It didn’t look right when I looked up the recipe, the batter smelled like flour, and the recipe in the pudding was to dense and rubbery. Adjust the flour and the recipe will be great
4324	544	Used Asian persimmons rom my garden, and didn't fully puree completely. Great to start with, and even better served cold the next day after being refrigerated overnight!
4325	544	I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful!
4326	544	Very easy to make. Comes out cake like I think it does better with time. Also I used 3c persimmon due to not wanting to toss the extra ??.  Also I got sidetracked during the mixing of the eggs and milk and I beat the devil out of them...
4327	544	Second time making this. I like it better than the persimmon pudding I grew up with. It is a little less sweet and sticky and the texture is more of what I would expect from a baked pudding.
4328	544	Very nice dessert. Easy to make.
4329	545	Followed the directions and it came out great. If you dont like very sweet stuff cut back on the sugar for sure. The top was a bit sticky, but nothing terrible. It came right out no problems.
4330	545	Made it vegan, by subbing  light coconut milk for regular milk, and flax seed 2 tbsp in 1/4 cup milk for  2 eggs. Also subbed 1/2 cup ground almond flour for reg flour,  which made it very rich. Only used 1 1/2 cup sugar, and spiced with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground mace. Topped with roasted pecans, cinnamon and sugar. So good!
4331	545	Absolutely delicious! The recipe is easy to follow.
4332	545	I've been making persimmon cakes for years and this is my favorite recipe so far.  Perfect use for native North American persimmons.   It really lets the persimmon flavor shine front and center, and the texture is both light and moist.  It's best eaten unfrosted and stuffed directly into your face, sans plate or fork.  It seems to actually taste better the next day than it does fresh.  This stuff is the manna of the Gods.
4333	545	This was delicious and moist.  I made it twice in about 2 weeks and everyone loves it!  I left the pulp a little more chunky the second time to get the little tasty pieces of persimmon rather than turning it into a paste.  I like the pieces better.  I also added about a tablespoon of cinnamon because I LOVE cinnamon and it was soooo good!  Such a perfect recipe!
4334	545	Very good cake with only a hint of persimmon taste.  I used the recipe as written and really will not change when I bake it again.   My only concern with this recipe is the picture posted with it.   It is clearly not a 9 x 13 pan!   It would help to post time and temperature if baked in the traditional tube pan or bundt pan.
4335	545	Very dense. Not like cake at all, and not much flavor.
4336	545	Easy to cook and gooddddd
4337	545	I followed this recipes exactly. It puffed up very well, but once you take it out of the oven, it deflated like crazy. The only thing I can think of is that I pureed the persimmons, maybe that made it too wet...
4338	546	Easy and delish!  The only comment I have is the ingredients should show the measurement for the persimmons. Another review noted 2 persimmons is 1 cup puree. I was glad to see that because my persimmons were small.
4339	546	I made a double recipe and used 4 persimmons that pureed came out to 2 cups. I cut down on the amount of cloves and nutmeg  because last year my cookies had an overwhelming spice flavor and this batch was perfect. They have a cake like consistency which is exactly how I wanted them to be. This will be my go to recipe for persimmon cookies from now on.
4340	546	Very tasty everyone love it  can stop eating  they are so good .
4341	546	These are the best Persimmon cookies I’ve made
4342	546	Great way to use this odd fruit!! Make sure your persimmon is ripe! Nice moist drop cookie with a subtle spice flavor !! Delicious!
4343	546	I had some very ripe persimmons (too soft to eat) so checked out this easy recipe. I didn’t have any ground cloves but did have pumpkin spice so used that. They are a moist, soft cookie so if you’re into a crunchy cookie these probably aren’t for you. I made these last night and this morning my plan was to grab a couple to have with my coffee drink.... and a couple is all I got.  Can’t wait to get some more persimmons!(and neither can my family apparently). Thanks for sharing this simple recipe
4344	546	No changes and definitely will  make again
4345	546	I used 1/2 cup more chucky pulp for a fruiter cookie. I used a teaspoon of vanilla. I refrigerated my dough before cooking. Then added raisins and pecans in some as well as just walnuts in others. I like the walnuts but I don't like sweet desserts. I made about 8 dozen and some were gifts but family and company ate them very quickly. Great with coffee in AM.

4347	547	The recipe is great, but there advice by another person reviewing it is somewhat dangerous.  Persimmons are not acidic enough to be safely preserved with a boiling water canner and there is no tested recipe demonstrated to reliably acidify persimmon puree enough to protect against botulism, which can kill.There's also no tested recipe for home pressure canning persimmon puree (or pumpkin puree (or really any non-acidic puree) and there is no evidence of adequate heating in the center of a jar of such a puree.I'm sure there is a she way to adequately acidify persimmon puree to make boiling water canning safe.  I'm also sure there is an amount of time adequate for pressure canning of non-acidic persimmon puree.  But I know for an absolute fact that nobody has proven what the safe recipe and canning process is to make home canning of persimmon butter safe.Without that, you're playing Russian roulette with the lives of the people who eat your preserves.By all means, go ahead and process your persimmon butter in a boiling-water canner before storing it in your refrigerator.  That may extend its usability.But don't store it at room temperature.
4348	547	Very good recipe. Used honey as sweetener. Made a batch with lemon juice and cloves just like recipe. It's very bright and tasty. Made another with orange juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cardamom which reminds us of pumpkin pie.
4349	547	This  recipe is great!  Instead of a lemon, I use the juice of an orange and add the orange zest.   I also don't bother peeling and use a stick blender directly in the crock pot to blend everything easily.   I have made this recipe for at least 5 years now and i look forward to it every year.
4350	547	Recipe gives a great guide for the mechanics of making and canning the butter but it lacks in the spice department. I added more spice, some cloves and ground ginger to balance the citrus. Definitely taste and add more or less to your liking.
4351	547	Seems like an easy way to can the persimmons I have into great Christmas gifts. As soon as mine ripen a bit, I’ll be making this for the holidays.
4352	547	It's so smooth and the perfect texture....my kids even love it and sneak finger fulls as I'm trying to jar it!
4353	547	Really good stuff! I made a few slight changes, and it came out delicious. Used about 16 persimmons (all I had). They were frozen so I just let them sit for a bit. Washed and then cut the tops off. Put them in the slow cooker and set it to low for 10 hours. Then mashed them with a potato masher and then used an immersion blender. (Could have skipped the potato masher part but at first I thought I'd want a more chunky butter, but after mashing I could tell I was wrong and would want a smoother texture). Added a bunch of cinnamon. Added a nice helping of nutmeg and vanilla bean paste. Added a bit of ginger and mace. Then added a couple good glugs of pure maple syrup. Let it cook for 4-6 hours with the lid off, stirring occasionally. It is much darker than the picture I posted shows. It is wonderful warm, room temp, and cold. But slightly warm is our favorite!
4354	547	I've made this recipe twice since Thanksgiving using persimmons from my father's tree, the seeds of which originate from Bari, Italy his home town.  The results are excellent if you like apple butters and fig compotes.  I'd recommend lightly toasting slices of brick oven bakery bread, spreading with goat cheese and topping with a layer of the persimmon butter.  It's truly delicious.  One thing I did differently was to further concentrate the butter by placing it in a shallow baking dish at 275 degrees for an hour or so, stirring periodically.  Enjoy!
4355	547	24 persimmons got me a little less than 3 pints.  I didn't cook in the crockpot as long (I had to go to bed!) but even at 6 hours, it was good.  I used honey instead of agave (1:1 exchange) and went ahead and canned it in a water bath (boiling water for 15 min).  I didn't process my not full pint and just put it in the fridge.  This morning I had it with some yummy toast and I went a little weak in the knees it was soooo good.  A rich, fall flavored little treat.  So yummy!
4356	548	This is good but my grandmother's very old recipe called for 1 cup of brown sugar and not white sugar, and that's how we have always made it. Maybe try that.
4357	548	yummy
4358	548	This is a good recipe! my first time making Persimmon cookies so I have nothing to compare this to. BUT I love cookies and I had my idea of what I thought these should feel and taste like. These cookies are a little bready, like a chewy muffin almost. I think next time Ill put half brown sugar and half white, also Ill fold in my egg instead of whipping it. Maybe Ill get a little chewier consistency. But they are great! My husband says they taste just like his grandpas.
4359	548	Great recipe.
5543	705	Excellent recipe. One mango and two avocados will help cut the overwhelming sweetness of three mangos.
4360	548	They were good...  but can't really compete with a table of desserts... pumpkin pie, shortbread, chocolate chip cookies.  Most of these cookies were left over.
4361	548	Good flavor and very moist.  maybe too many raisins for my taste.  I added coconut to one batch, also very tasty.
4362	548	Had a lot of extra persimmons and this was a great way to use them. Only had pecans (not walnuts). I’m glad there was a review giving me information about how adding the persimmon pulp at the end was when it all creamed together perfectly.
4363	548	We’d been looking for something to do with our extra persimmons. These turned out great.
4364	548	i added  cloves
4365	549	Not great. Deflated ??
4366	549	I read some reviews saying that the muffins were a bit bland so I really upped the spices and they’re still bland! They came out nice and the consistency is perfect but very little flavor. I think I’d try this exact recipe again using pumpkin instead of persimmons.
4367	549	I like the bumpy, crunchy tops.  However, I did sprinkle a bit of organic sugar on top to sweeten them and 1/4 c. raisins.  I think because the persimmons I added didn’t seem sweet or ripened enough it lacked some sweetness.
4368	549	I was given a huge batch of persimmons from a friend's tree.   This was a perfect use for them.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract for sweetness and sprinkle them lightly with powder sugar as a desert perfection.  My family of picky eaters destroyed them at Thanksgiving.
4369	549	I really like this recipe but I also didn't add any walnuts because not everyone in my family likes them so I just left them out. Otherwise I followed everything in the recipe and they turned out great I LOVE THEM!!!! However, the next time I make them I will probably add more cinnamon just because I love it otherwise they were perfect.
4370	549	I found persimmons in the store and thought we would try them.My husband and son liked the muffins and I thought they were ok. There just wasn't enough persimmon flavor in them for me. The only change I made was to use gluten free flour.
4371	550	I made them as stated in the recipe.  They were delicious!
4372	550	Ok Recipe, probably better with cream cheese frosting.  I highly recommend James Beard Persimmon Bread Recipe. My alterations: 1/3 c peach snaps + 1/3 c apricot brandy and 1 c raisins +, 1/2 c dried cranberries, chopped a little + 1/2 c diced dried mango
4373	550	Made this  recipe many times.   My workplace has learned to look for these.  Also wonderful in Christmas baking. They are a hit!  I will freeze the extra persimmon pulp in 1 cup bags for  ease in future baking.
4374	550	Great way to use persimmons! I leave out the raisins (personal preference), and use cream cheese frosting to add a bit of zing. Otherwise, it's a little too sweet for me.
4375	550	Wow! Great recipe! But a healthy note: cut sugar in half ( I substituted 1/4 c honey, 1/4c coconut sugar) also threw in a half of a Fuji apple. No raisins and  Plenty sweet! I also substituted almond flour for white flour. Ok, so I’m on a health binge. So yummy just the same!!
4376	550	Texture was awful and 20 minutes in a jelly roll pan was too much time.  Tried next day in a smaller pan with slightly better results but dont think I’ll make again.  Best thing about was the lemon glaze.  Doubled glaze and put it on with holes poked in cake.  That helped.  Positives:  easy to make, quick, good glaze.  CONS:  terrible texture (tough), taste was only so—so.
4377	550	Made exactly according to the recipe  using 1 cup persimmon pulp. Quick & easy to make and so so good. Almost didn't put the glaze on as my husband prefers his sweets without topping but even he says the lemon glaze is perfect. Thank you for sharing.
4378	550	It was easy to make, moist, and tasty. Next time I’ll leave out the confectioners sugar glaze. My two year old sons also loved it.
4379	550	I made this recipe both with and without nuts. It is really fantastic. Family and friends have enjoyed them.
4380	551	Added 1 cup of raisins instead of toffee.  Changed spices to 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Baked for 12 minutes, and came out perfect!  Yum!
4381	551	Just  made these cookies and they came out great. They are soft and moist. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and loved it!
4382	551	Moist and delicious! I made my own puree from overripe fuyu persimmons in a food processor. I also used only 1/2 t. of salt and cut up 1 1/2 heath bars which worked great! I used an ice cream scoop about 2 inches in diameter and the cookies needed about 20 minutes to bake. I love the texture of the outside a little firm/crisp and the inside stays really moist.
4383	551	Very moist and delicious cookie. My vegetarian grandkids love them.
4384	551	Moist, delicious twist on oatmeal cookies!
4385	551	These were tasty! Very soft and sweet.  The persimmon flavor is very faint. My only complaint with this recipe is I ended up almost doubling the bake time. I have a very old gas oven so it could have to do with my antiquated kitchen equipment. Thanks for the recipe!
4386	551	I made the recipe exactly as written, using fuyu variety persimmons fresh from my backyard.  The texture of the cookies was good - soft, with a good chewiness added from the oats.  But the flavor was just not what I was hoping for. It was a little on the salty side, and even with the toffee bits, they are not sweet enough for me (and my 3yo son spit it out and said it was yucky).  I'm new to persimmons, so I don't have much recipe experience to compare to, but I couldn't taste the flavor of persimmon at all- just the spices (and salt) I added in.  And that was disappointing for me, because I could achieve that with applesauce if I wanted to. Anyway, my search for a great persimmon cookie recipe continues, I suppose.
4387	551	These are so good and easy. Followed the recipe except... didn't have heath bar bitys so used white chocolate chips. Next time will get the heath bar chips even if have to go to grocery. were good even without them.
4388	551	soft
4389	552	I didn’t think I was going to like, but these mufffins were so goodI recommend giving the recipe a shot!
4390	552	Got the toddler stamp of approval!  They even asked me for another while writing this review.  I ended up substituting butter for coconut oil.  By filling the cups 2/3 full I got 11 muffins, to leftovers. Will make again!
4391	552	Delicious!
4392	552	Easy to make! I doubled up on bananas and added walnuts, so needed to bake another 5-7 minutes. Delicious.
4393	552	Made a batch and a half, which yielded 12 muffins. Cut the sugar by a third, added a bit of coconut palm sugar, added a little cinnamon to the batter and just bashed up fruit with a potatoe masher instead of using a mixer, otherwise made as directed. Mine turned out very blonde in color and not toasted like the photos.  I don’t know if it was because I cut the sugar or what. Very tasty, great for breakfast!
4394	552	This is so easy and I loved the flavors. Banana and Persimmon meld together nicely. Finding Persimmons is not easy but we'll worth the effort.
4395	552	I added raisins and walnuts and turned out very good. I also added no white sugar, but used stevia for sweetner.
4396	552	The first thing that I noticed when starting to make these muffins was 6 muffins.... why after getting all the ingredients together this recipe only made 6 muffins...make a recipe using all muffin tins.    I Would have love to double the recipe if I would have had extra ingredients.  The reason for making this recipe, for me was to try persimmon, I had never used persimmon or had ever tasted one I wanted to learn about them.  I let the persimmon ripe for about a week and when I went to peel the persimmon I noticed it had a feel black spots and then the rest was hard not easy to mash I was not sure if the Persimmon was good or not but I carried on making the muffins.  I didn't read all the steps first before making the muffins and I add all the ingredients in the first step together without mixing before adding the next ingredient.  The first thing I noticed was the big chunks of persimmon and the coconut oil hardening.  but I left them like that I thought maybe the would taste good like that ..After mixing all the ingredients and pouring into prepared muffins cups the batter ended up making 9 muffins I don't know whether this was because of the chunks persimmons but i had to use a  turkey baster to get all the water out of each extra muffin cup until I used up all the batter.  Into the oven they went.  I will let you know how they taste as soon as they cool
4397	552	I used more persimmons and gluten-free flour. Family loved these.
4398	553	It was hard to get a smooth consistency even with a hand mixer on high.  Does have more of a spongy consistency like ricotta rather than the firm creaminess of classic cheesecake. Did taste good, and I would definitely use this tasty crust for gluten free desserts in the future.
4399	553	This is amazing ! Read other review and used gingersnap cookies for crust, as recommended. An awesome alternative to Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie. We topped ours with a little sour cream and a little whipped cream. All rave reviews from those who got a slice.
4400	553	It was very good but reminded me more of pumpkin pie.  I would probably use less spices next time.  Yes I would make it again.
4401	553	I made this for Christmas Eve Dessert exactly according to the recipe and it came out fantastic.  I only used a strainer to separate the skin/peels from the pulpy center.  Perfect texture, walnut crust was amazing and really complemented the persimmon.  Creamy delicious flavor.
4402	553	too runny and I even cooked it longer than recommended.
4403	553	I just made this last night, and it was fantastic. I rarely give a recipe five stars, but this earned it. I disagree with the reviewers who said that it was too runny, or didn't have enough persimmon taste. I didn't strain my persimmon puree at all, and my cheesecake had the perfect, creamy texture and a whole lot of persimmon taste. Since I used a crushed gingersnap cookie crust, I omitted the ginger in the cake and used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg instead. I also didn't do the sour cream topping. Instead I served it with fresh whipped cream. Awesome cheesecake. Can't wait to serve it to friends.
4404	553	The recipe should've said to blend cream cheese first and then slowly add the persimmon pulp.  I tried this to the letter "combine" and the consistency was like ricotta cheese.
4405	553	Good flavor, but too eggy and soggy.  I won't make this again.
4406	553	Made this dessert for X-mas. Loved, loved it because it was my first trial utilizing persimmon. Lovely sweet fruit, not overpowering. Cut the recipe down to an 8" spring form. I made it w/ the typical graham cracker crust, but the bottom came out a bit sticky & gooey... made me love it more.
4407	555	Made as written. Delicious! After tasting it as made, I stirred in a splash of half and half to boost the creaminess and a bit more salt. Next time I will peel the persimmons and pick out the bay leaf before blending, but great recipe as is!
4408	555	What a delicious and healthy soup!! The soup was so easy to make, and very delicious. It felt like a rich soup, but no grease on the tongue and no bomb in the belly.
4409	555	I purchased a persimmon for the 1st time in my life so of course I went to Allrecipes to see what I could make! Made it exactly as the recipe
4410	556	Yummmy
4411	556	Delicious cookies.  I added some water when mixing the wet and dry ingredients because the batter was too thick. Came out great!
4412	556	prerty good
4413	556	Definitely beats raw persimmons
4414	556	Super delicious cookie!! Great way to use those persimmons!!!
4415	515	Light, gorgeous, delicious.  Loved it as did the dinner party.  I added some berries and diced papaya for color and it was a hit!  Turned out perfect!
4416	558	I thought it was delicious! I used it to top an authentic Bavarian cream I made. The fatness if the compote counter-acted the sweetness of the cream. Was worried the ginger would be too strong. Don't skimp on it.
4417	559	Really beautiful cake, I made it for a halloween potluck. I changed the recipe up a bit because I had really firm but sweet persimmons so it needed a bit of liquid. I used 1 cup of oat milk, about 1/4 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup sugar. I made it completely vegan. It needed about another 5 mins in my oven. Thank you!
4418	559	I loved this recipe!!Hello from 2022!I mashed so much American persimmon into pulp during the fall my freezer is screaming at me. Alas I came across this recipe!Now I did substitute some and tweak as I went along depending on what I had handily  available.For the toppings I had papaya and used white sugar and some wildflower honey with the butter for that melody.For the cake I didn't have baking powder or lemon juice no pecans nor ground cloves. I substituted lime juice vanilla extract and a package of mayonnaise.  It came out like a moist cakey bread. Thick and dense. It carries alot of fall flavors in a way no other staples do. Gingerbread without the crunch.I look forward to trying this recipe again when I have all the ingredients.  An I'm currently curious the age of this recipe.  A cake make without milk or eggs. Convenient when lacking ingredients an still wanting your cake and eaingt it too!! It smelled so buttery sweet cooking! 5 stars. Would try again.
4419	559	I skipped the pecans (accidentally) and replaced lemon zest with orange zest (intentionally). I also doubled the bake time which resulted in some really awesome caramel flavors coming through the entire cake. Absolutely delicious, can't wait to bake again.
4420	559	Super moist and flavorful. I used Hachiya persimmons so the pulp was very high in water content. Cake tastes more like a persimmon pudding and is delicious. I will make it again.
4453	564	This was amazing!!  It was moist, not too sweet... what a great way to use up persimmons from our tree.  Thank you for the recipe. I'm making it again this week and might even make extra to freeze.
4421	559	This seemed too dense and undercooked to me. I baked it for over an hour before pick came out clean. Perhaps it because I used hachiya persimmons for the batter, and fuyus for the bottom. Also it seemed too much  batter for a 9” cake pan resulting in the batter spilling over and diminishing the aesthetics of the finished product.
4422	559	Amazing cake! I've made it twice: once for me, and once for the neighbors who gave me Fuyu persimmons from their tree.
4423	559	My first time baking with persimmons.  Really good. Very easy to make. I saw comments about added bake time, wasn’t necessary.  This now a favorite.
4424	559	Absolute fave. Eggs not neccessary. Cake turned out moist and yummy did need a bit longer than recipe stated. Was in for almost 1hr and 15 mins total.
4425	559	I noticed there were NO eggs in this recipe, so I added one. What a disappointment . The edges were baked and the middle was complete mush...even after I put it back in the oven for 40 minutes!
4426	560	I used gluten-free flour, and 1/4 c less sugar.   I also took the suggestion of others and only made half the sauce and agree it’s not necessary but adds a little something. I served it warm with very lightly sweetened whipped cream.  For testing purposes only ?? I had another serving later when it was cool and can report its delicious cold also! Look forward to making it again.     (Note:  I pulped my persimmons by slicing soft fruits in half laterally, scooping pulp out of the skin with a tea spoon and briefly using an emersion hand held blender.)
4427	560	This recipe was perfect. I made two small changes - I substituted maple syrup for the honey and I substituted 1 cup of dark brown sugar for a cup of white sugar. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I made my semi-sweet whipped cream to top it off. I will make this again every holiday season. Thanks Nonnie for this recipe.
4428	560	Thank you so much for sharing your recipe! This is  very much like my grandmothers recipe. She has been gone for years and  this dessert brings back wonderful memories. -Sherry
4429	560	Sickly sweet and it did not set. Rechecked all the ingredients and nothing was missed. Haven't given it another go as it was just too sweet to be enjoyable.
4430	560	I make this dish every thanksgiving. This become part of our tradition. The only differences I substitute Splenda brown for the sugar and add molasses instead of honey. I've made it with both eating persimmons and cooking persimmons and it is a lot firmer with the cooking persimmons. I used to sub the buttermilk for nonfat milk. It is a lot better with the buttermilk and cream, as the recipe was written well!
4431	560	If you are looking for a persimmon pudding recipe, this is the one.  I sometimes make it with the glaze and sometimes I leave the glaze off.  It is fabulous either way.
4432	560	I'm not using a sweets fan, but the was incredibly scrumptious. I was quite proud and the end result surpassed my expectations!
4433	560	It was great. I had to make a batch and a half because power loss from ice storm. It was great. I did use the topping as it was and did not compensate for the extra and it was perfect. Yummy
4434	560	I loved this.  It turned out great.  Was well received at our Thanksgiving.
4435	561	Easy recipe to make and delicious!
4436	561	I had a big box of persimmons to use so I tried this recipe. To me it's more of a butter, as in apple butter, than a jam. Still, it's very good. I cut the sugar back to one cup because I don't have a strong sweet tooth. My persimmons, however, were so ripe I think I probably could have omitted the sugar all together. Will make again.
4437	561	Tasty but super thick and unspreadable.
4438	561	Used local hachiya persimmons that were very ripe. Peeled, puréed.  Used less sugar than called for.  Also used the baking soda addition suggested in one of the reviews.  Baking soda (added while cooking -- may have been a bad idea) made the mixture foam up to almost spill over the pot!  Settled down after some time and a lot  of stirring.  Result was still a little fuzzy, too sweet, dark orange-red in color, but still quite edible. Next time I will look for a pectin recipe that  uses little to no sugar.  Would have been good to recommend constant stirring in this recipe as the bottom burns quiet readily.
4439	561	This jam was really good. Instead of using nutmeg I used cinnamon. Still think this could have been better though.
4440	561	This is delicious! We read all the reviews prior to making and tried to make sure we didn't run into the same "fuzzy" problem. We used very ripe persimmons and no fuzzy taste at all. The trick is making sure they are very soft without being bad. Very easy to make and the whole family loves it!
4441	561	There are different types of persimmons: fuyu, which can be eaten firm and look like a tomato; hachiya, which is not edible until fully ripen and naturally crack, and looks like a giant acorn.
4442	561	Loved how easy it was to make and it turned out Delicious!  didn't have nutmeg so I substituted with cinnamon. Cant wait to make another batch with nutmeg. Yum!!!
4443	561	Two suggestions:
4444	562	I loved the sweet persimmon with the creamy burrata; the vinegar just helps with a sophisticated kick. This is excellent with a crisp white wine.
4445	563	I made half a recipe and it was enough for (2) 3-1/2" x 7" loaf pan. Baking time was about 40 minutes for this size pan. This is a nice, Fall bread. The persimmon flavor doesn't really come through that much, although the cranberry does. I tasted the end piece (so I could do the review), but I plan to freeze the rest for Thanksgiving.
4446	564	Easy and very good but too sweet for my taste. I took out the cup of white sugar and replace it with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.
4447	564	I made this without the cinnamon as I wanted to taste more of the persimmon flavor.  I would definitely make this again!  Very moist and flavorful.
4448	564	I have made this several times in the last two years. I lost the original recipe my grandma had given me and I was heartbroken until I stumbled across this recipe. IT is exactly the same and even cooked in the same type of baking dish. Thank you for the recipe! I highly recommend it.
4449	564	I used regular milk and half the sugar, and it still turned out amazing. I also added extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I definitely recommend Gram's amazing and malleable persimmon pudding recipe.
4450	564	Loved it! Never cooked with persimmons before and this was the first recipe I tried and it was a big hit! Was really great with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge!
4451	564	My kids loved this. It's like a bread pudding with pumpkin pie flavor.  Perfect with a sploosh of whipped cream on top.  Not as good after a day, so plan on making this and serving soon after.
4452	564	I have loved this recipe in years past but is has evolved in to something even better over the last few years.
4454	564	This is a delicious dessert. I found that after a few days it was even better. Keep in the fridge and warm it up before you eat..with a scoop of vanilla ice cream..deeeelicious!!!
4455	565	This was quite good.  I liked the addition of persimmon.. gave it a nice slight hint of sweetness.. not overpowering. This  would also be good with turkey breast.. I will make this again
4456	566	Used my sourdough bread because it’s here. The roasted persimmon was wonderful. Thanks for sharing
4457	567	I cut the recipe in half and used gluten free 1 to 1 flour. The color is a little odd but they have a great taste!
4458	567	I used the recipe and used just a bit more pulp. I added raisins and pecans to some. I liked the walnuts only best but I don't like super sweet cookies and deserts. These were moist and great with coffee in the morning. Everyone loved them. I made about 8 dozen. I gifted some; but the company and family couldn't keep their hands off.
4459	567	Followed recipe and they were great, a little deviation next time.
4460	567	I made some exactly as the recipe said and I thought they were dry and tasteless. I then added raisins and topped with cinnamon and sugar and they were still dry but editable. I lowered the oven to 350 degrees and they were the best however, I would never make this recipe again.
4461	567	Great recipe! I halved the batter and added semi sweet chips. Kids loved them. Reminded me of a muffin top. I wanted a little kick & density so I added 1 tsp. Allspice and 1 additional cup persimmon puree. Will make again!
4462	567	These were more like little cakes than cookies.  They were wonderful, and my family gobbled them up in record time.  I will be making more today.
4463	567	I used half white sugar and half brown sugar for the rich taste.  I also put dried cranberries in them.  YUM!!
4464	567	Easy and delicious!
4465	567	These are the best soft cookies! I come from a family that hates persimmons with a passion, but these cookies won them over.
4466	568	very heavy indeed.  I made this exactly as described and alas, did not finish it.
4467	568	A friend gave me some persimmons and I've never used them before so came to Allrecipes for some ideas. I chose this recipe and everyone in my family liked the end result.  My kids and husband both said it was better than they thought it would be. Based on the picture, I chose to do one Bundt-shaped bread instead of two loaves (mostly because I thought my kids would be more likely to eat it if it were shaped like a cake). Anyway, I sprinkled some raw sugar in the pan before pouring in the batter, so it had a sweet, crunchy top to it. I really liked the seasonings that make me think of fall/winter holidays. I baked for 1 hour, but probably should have taken it out 5 minutes earlier using the Bundt pan, but still it was was moist and yummy. I probably would not seek out persimmons for the purpose of making this, but if someone gave me some again I would definitely re-make this one.
4468	568	The bread is good, a little dense, but not unbearably so.  The only thing that If ind lacking is the fact that the persimmon flavor is very subtle.
4469	568	I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great! I baked two loaves for an hour and I think I could have gotten away with 50-55 minutes, so check your bread after 50 minutes and adjust accordingly.
4470	568	Super moist and fluffy. I added ripe banana mash instead of applesauce and chia seeds just for fun. The spices really make the bread flavorful and unique. This would be perfect for Thanksgiving brunch.
4471	568	This was my first time making persimmon bread and I think it turned out well, although I couldn't really taste the persimmons. I halved the recipe because I only had a cup of puree and it worked out fine. I did add only 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and it turned out plenty sweet. I also cut the allspice a bit too. I cooked them as mini muffins for approximately 15 minutes.
4472	568	Instead of making my usual persimmon cookies and persimmon pudding I tried this one and it turned out great.  I did substitute another 1/2 cup persimmon pulp for the 1/2 cup applesauce.  This bread isn't too sweet and I like the use of whole wheat flour and oatmeal.
4473	568	This bread is delicious. I used 1 1/2 c. sugar, 3 tsp. Garam Masala Indian spices blend (instead of the other spices),  1 c. persimmon and 1 c. banana, and added walnuts. Wonderful and unusual. Great with Tetley Cardamom Tea.
4474	568	I used this recipe to use up pulp I had left over from making fresh juices.  I had been looking for a good recipe to use it up and this one called for quite a bit of pulp.  The pulp I had used consisted of apple, beet, celery, and lots of carrot.  It worked great!    it was a little heavy on the all spice for me - but it is still really delicious.  half went into a loaf, the other half went into muffins which I baked for around 30 min. The taste great!
4475	569	My persimmons where ripe, but still a bit firm, they went into the bread pan chopped and the machine pulverized them just fine. I did use more persimmon,  2 persimmons worth. Increased the water too, 9 tablespoons of water was simply not going to work at all.
4476	569	for best results, double the amount of yeast, heat the persimmons to body temperature first, add some walnuts and rolled oats, increase the raisins by 50%, use 50/50 whole/white flour, use 50/50 barely-melted butter/coconut oil, and honey instead of sugar.  The recipe needs to be adapted if you don't use an electric bread maker. It came out a bit to wet at first, which was corrected with extra flour.   Truly delicious!
4477	569	I tried this recipe and with a few changes per another reviewer, and thought it was delicious.  It was even much better the next morning toasted with a a light buttering.  The changes I made were to increase the persimmon pulp to 1 1/2 cups and the water to 12 tbsp.  I did not use a bread machine and divided the bread into 2 pieces and baked them in 3 1/2 x 6 inch pans at 350 for about 30 min.  While eating the toasted bread, I thought that nuts would have been a great addition!
4478	569	I've made this three times in my bread machine with super ripe persimmons I froze whole.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out right.  Much too dry.  I made it again and kept adding water until the dough looked right.  The third time I added the called for water and increased the amount of persimmon to 1 and 1/2 cup.  The bread was really moist and fantastic.
4479	569	Recipe needs to be corrected - 5 minutes preparation time and 3 minutes cooking time in a breadmaker is obviously in error!
4480	569	A wonderful raisin bread.Not too sweet, the way I like it. Love the persimmon pulp in it, keeps the bread moist. A hit with the family. I used a half cup raisins instead,though. I will make this bread over and over again.
4481	570	PLEASE make sure you've got RIPE persimmons.  I used Hichayu and made the recipe without checking online to read that particular information.  Hichayus need to be totally ripe before eating.  Fuyus don't.  My grocery only stocks Hichayus, and I just didn't check the ripeness.  It's all on me.  BITTER, BITTER, BITTER!  Looked pretty baked, though.
4482	570	I LOVE persimmon's, every member of my family from my great grandmother on down to my family have had both the Apple Persimmon and The soft mushy persimmon tree's. I've always eaten them plain or with peanut butter . After looking up other ways to use them I found this and have to say it is a fantastic, easy to prepare pie. The first time I made it I didn't have corn starch so I used regular flower, it was good, but the second time I made it I used the corn starch and it was even better.
4483	570	this was awesome! not one slice left.  Followed it to a T and it turned out great!  Will make it again next fall.
4484	570	yuck, do not like these persimmons. will stick with the real thing.
4485	570	This smelled great while it was baking and I couldn't wait to sample it.  I took it to a party and was extremey disappointed and wished I had tried it at home first.  Taste-wise it was okay, but the texture was not appealing to me.  It was very dry and crumbly.  I won't be making this again.
4486	570	So quick and easy and delicious! I thought 1 Tb of cinnamon sounded like a lot, but it was perfect! Smelled divine while it was baking too.
4487	570	This recipe is out of this world, but be sure to serve warm or hot.  The texture of the persimmons change if it gets too cool.
4488	571	I made these and followed one persons review by adding 3  cups of flour instead of four. I also made the persimmon pulp and raisin paste. My cookies were more like cake cookies. They are soft and moist and taste delicious but very spongey and crumbled.
4489	571	Best we have ever eaten.  Thanks for sharing a family recipe.
4490	571	This truly is an old recipe, for it doesn’t have any commercial leavening agents. And it’s fantastic! I used unsalted butter and cut the sugar in half (the raisin paste makes them PLENTY sweet). They were a smash at the coffee klatch where I served them—the flavor is just amazing.
4491	571	These are so good.  My grandkids LOVE them.  ( but I have to admit, as picky as they are, they don’t know they are persimmon cookies.  We call them orange raisin cookies.
4492	571	I used raisins instead of paste, though I am sure that the paste maybe better. I used half white sugar and the other half molasses and they were delicious!
4493	571	Great recipe. Wasn't able to find raisin paste so I hydrated some raisins and chopped them up in a food processor.  I may try one less cup of flour to see if it will make a crisp cookie.
4494	571	This was a very tasty cookie!  I made a couple of changes out of necessity:  I used raisins vs. raisin paste.   I also substituted 1 Cup of apple sauce for 1 Cup of the persimmons and increased the flour by 1/2 cup to compensate.  The result was a flavorfilled cakey cookie that was perfect for breakfast with a cup of coffee!  My husband took a batch to work and told me they were such a hit, the plate was empty within minutes!
4495	571	They took a lot longer to cook more like 18 to 20 minutes. They came out well, however if I were to make this recipe again I would add the persimmon pulp in with the wet ingredients and then add the dry ingredients. It was extremely difficult to mix up these cookies the way that it is written. I exchanged half of the white sugar with brown sugar and left out the raisins.
4496	571	fabulous and flavorful
4497	572	I’m from  Paoli , right next to Orleans.
4498	572	I have it 4 stars because the baking time was way off, but otherwise it tastes delicious. I had to bake it for 55 minutes instead of the 25 minutes suggested. It is very sweet using the 2 cups of sugar so it could probably be lowered to taste.
4499	573	The texture was perfect as a pudding; I used less sugar at 1 1/2 c. and probably could have used a bit less, since my hachiya persimmons were fully ripe, soft and the pulp was super sweet. I pureed the persimmons, including the skins, and substituted 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon. Served it warm with a little whipping cream--a new family favorite!
4500	573	I liked the consistency of this bread-like pudding -- a bit chewy and sticky. It is good served a bit chilled.
4501	573	My son gathers and purées the persimmons in the fall when they start to drop.  Puts up many quarts in the freezer.  He uses this recipe, and man, it doesn’t last long....   Who knew an “overly mature” fruit from trees in our woods would make such a tasty dish!  I recommend using this recipe for your wild persimmons.
4502	573	This dessert is SO Good!! I followed recipe except I used 1-1/2 cups of flour because it’s the consistency we are used to here in Indiana. I had lost my original recipe and this one is close. I did add a ‘dash’ of nutmeg also. Thanks for posting!
4503	573	I reduced the sugar a bit. It was fantastic!
4504	573	The recipe also yields 2 pies  ( 9" inch regular).  I baked it for 50 minutes.  I plan to eat one now and freeze the other.
4505	573	It looks like a vanilla wafer, but it really does taste wonderful
4506	573	Delicious way to finish off our last box of persimmons!
4507	573	Made it as is except I accidentally added 1/2 TBS of Cinnamon and it was still very yummy.  Everyone loved it!
4508	574	Loved it
4509	574	Excellent recipe and use of persimmons! Very tasty, and definitely worth making.  Instead of adding nutmeg (which I don't like the taste of), I substituted another 1/4 tsp. of ginger. The recipe turned out really well. It was moist and an exceptional treat.
4510	574	Moist and delicious. I only cooked it an hour but next time would cook a little longer.
4511	574	Delicious. Made this for Christmas gathering. Lots of positive comments.
4512	574	i will be adding more.Thank you
4513	533	I used mixed greens since I don’t like kale. Also had walnuts so I used those.  A pretty and tasty salad!
4514	577	I had never tried persimmons in any form before these cookies.
4515	578	Wanted to add raisins, but only added chocolate chips.  It was perfect!  Baked 13 minutes for soft cookies.
4516	578	Although there are 3 or 4 Persimmon cookie recipe's listed, if you look at the ingredients they are almost identical! This one has a picture of the cookies with frosting, but no mention of it in the recipe! I made them, doubled the cinnamon and cloves, very moist, but not very flavorful. I put in lots of raisins and no nuts.  I'm going to try putting some cream cheese frosting on them.
4517	578	They were ok but I doubt I will ever make them again. Not anything special.
4518	578	Just discovered we had some persimmon trees in our yard and was looking for persimmon recipes. Decided to try this one. Wow! They're awesome! I made them a little bigger than it said and they're almost like little muffins but still soooo good. Very simple and easy to make and delicious. And the house smells great!
4544	581	Easy enough but not much flavor.  I couldn't take the persimmons at all.
4545	581	We really enjoyed this mildly spicey way to use persimmons.
4519	578	The cookies are nice and soft...which I love. I added a bit more flour because I also added vanilla and a touch of nutmeg.. Next time, I'll add cranberries for more sweetness. I did dust them with powdered sugar, which helped. They would be great with nuts. But my daughter in-law is allergic to tree nuts. Also, this might just be a typo...the ingredients list baking powder, but the instructions don't indicate to add it to the flour mixture. I did, though. :)
4520	578	This turned out great!  Used golden raisins and they tasted wonderful.
4521	578	these are sooo good!!
4522	578	As suggested by another member, I used cranberries and pecans when I made this.  Also, I got lazy and made bars instead of cookies.  Baked for 35 minutes and topped with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!
4523	578	Good cookie.. Low in calories..
4524	579	This is an easy way to create a persimmon pudding.  I will use this more for a breakfast item with some Greek yoghurt, so I used brown sugar and cut it to 1/2 cup, all whole wheat flour, soy milk and vanilla.  It isn't a pretty pudding, but the taste and texture are good.
4525	579	Delicious!  I substituted coconut milk for milk, and vegan butter for the butter.  And coconut sugar for white sugar, plus whole wheat flour.  Still tasty!  Didn’t have quite enough sugar.  Very moist.  Would go great with whipped crew, vanilla ice cream, or cool whip.
4526	579	made this in a 9x9 glass pan because some reviews said 9x13 was too thin. it came out about 3 inches thick at edges, and slighty thinner in middle after cooling.  one important note, don't put the flour in blender first, it doesn't get mixed in well! Sweet, but tasted good, served it with whipping cream. thanks for recipe!
4527	579	My family insists on this pudding every Thanksgiving. I make it with two super-ripe hachiya persimmons and use only 3/4 cup of sugar.
4528	579	Tried this recipe but made it gluten free by replacing the all-purpose flour with 3/4 cup tapioca flour.  I knew the texture would end up being considerably different.  Had to bake it for 45 to 60 minutes.
4529	579	I have made this pudding recipe several times.  I take this every year to our family's Fall celebration at the Parke Co. Covered Bridge Festival...the recipe couldn't be easier and it bakes up perfectly...add a dollop of whipped cream and you've got Persimmon Paradise :-)
4530	579	Very thin, sweet, and a lot of work for not a very good product.  I think I'll make persimmon bread next time I have them laying around.
4531	579	This recipe is delicious and apparently fairly forgiving.  I had 3 persimmons, so that's what I used, I did not measure them, I just peeled them and stuck them in the blender...I also used 1 cup of sweetened condensed milk and 1/4 of skim milk instead of the 1 1/4 c milk it called for...then I added a dash of ground cloves and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked it in a glass pie dish for 40 minutes and it is absolutely delicious and set up perfectly.  I like it a little thicker, so the pie dish worked beautifully for my taste.  I was not expecting such wonderful results since I so loosely followed the directions.  It was a little lighter in color than I remember my grandmothers being, but it was also fluffier - I'm not sure that's the right word because persimmon pudding is by no means fluffy, but regardless, I really like it and I can't wait for my husband to get home and try it.  Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe - I will make it again and again!  (I also like the fact that there is no liquor in this recipe.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good stiff drink, but I don't like alcohol in my food, particularly in my desserts, I think it ruins the flavor of the fruit or chocolate or whatever it's being blended with so thanks again!)
4532	579	Good recipe. I baked mine in a 11 x 7 for 30 minutes and it came out fine; very moist and tender.
4533	580	Way too much vinegar!!!!  So disappointed.
4534	580	Made it just as recommended but added a handful of pomegranate. I also added a couple dashes of my favorite Caribbean hot sauce since I didn’t have the green peppers.
4535	580	It's a great recipe - I made it just as written with extra chiles since we like it hot. Those who complained about it being too vinegary did not reduce it enough to evaporate the vinegar out. I had it on medium heat, boiling, for about 35 mins before the raisins plumped up and the mixture got thick enough to be a chutney, at which point, the vinegar had mellowed out quite a bit. It's a lovely way to use persimmons.
4536	580	After reading reviews, I cut the vinegar to 1 cup, simmered for 30min. and omitted the peppers for my audience.  All others instructions followed as written...  Delicious and beautiful,  served over cream cheese with crackers to spread upon.
4537	580	I really liked this! I made it exactly as written and you have to simmer it long enough to evaporate the vinegar.  It combined with the other ingredients and leaves a nice tang.
4538	580	This is the first time I tried this recipe. Made a half batch and followed the proportions for the ingredients exactly as written. There is WAY TOO MUCH vinegar.  I will make it again-- but will use for a half batch -- about 1/3 c. and will balance out the remaining liquid with either apple juice or apple juice/water. As it cooled, it did get better,however, the prevailing taste was vinegar.  This is a very hearty chutney and would be good with duck or another game meat and should be served cold. With less vinegar, it might be OK at room temperature.
4539	580	I quadrupled this recipe so I could can it and give as holiday gifts. Glad the previous reviewers suggested using less vinegar; I used 1/2 of what was called for,  substituting other 1/2 for water. I used one large anaheim pepper, honey instead of sugar, and used both lemon & lime juice/zest. Delicious, can't wait to try with lamb chops! Also good if added to creamy base (i.e. butternut) and turned into soup.
4540	580	Yumdeliciousness! I didn't have some of the ingredients and it still worked great as a basic recipe.  Reduced the amount of vinegar to about 3/4 cup as per previous reviewer's suggestion and it still tasted pretty acidic; I'd keep reducing it even further (the lemon juice also adds acidity!).  I didn't use raisins or chile peppers; instead, put in some cumin and Southwestern seasoning and powdered ginger (a key ingredient in many Indian chutneys).  It made the kitchen smell terrific and everyone loved the final product. We had it with steak and parmesan mashed potatoes.
4541	580	moderately good
4542	581	This has a light persimmon taste and smells wonderful.  After baking them, I wanted a stronger taste so I cooked up a persimmon until soft and then pureed it with some powdered sugar and added this as a drizzle , I do think it needs something to give it some texture. next time I will add some almonds or walnuts
4543	581	3.5 would have been my rating, and I opted for 4 instead of 3 because I don't want to discourage others from trying it. I liked the flavor, though it is mild and if I make it again I would try to jazz it up a little more, maybe with nuts, raisins and more spices. I found the dough to be thick, sticky and difficult to work with, so I may not make them again solely for that reason.
4546	582	This is my go-to for banana bread. I've made this 20 times. This is important- if you don't dust your chocolate chips in flour FIRST, they will ALWAYS sink to the bottom of your pan and collect in a pile on the bottom. Dust them in flour just until they are coated (don't add the leftover dusting flour), and then FOLD them in at the very last minute before you pour it into your loaf pans. Look at the photos and especially the video. All the chips are on the bottom. If you coat the chips in flour, they don't sink to the bottom, and remain more evenly distributed throughout the bread. ps- Please don't tweak the recipe with other ingredients and then give it only 3 stars. Cooking is chemistry you can eat. Don't get a C in Chemistry class.
4547	582	Great recipe. Made muffins. Baked for 20 mins & they were perfectly yummy!!
4548	582	Everyone loved it!
4549	582	Thank you for this recipe! I only used 2 bowls (mixed all wet ingredients in one bowl after creaming butter & sugar).  It worked beautifully with Stevia for baking as well. Gone in one day between the 3 of us.
4550	582	this was absolutely incredible! i had to substitute the butter with margarine as i had no butter but honestly you cant even tell a difference in taste. was worried it would taste weird since my bananas werent as ripe but this was perfect!! 10/10 recommended so easy and soo yummy
4551	582	Yummy MMMMMMMM
4552	582	I love this recipe! The only thing I changed is I melted the butter all the way. My friends love it and ask for it constantly. 10/10 recommend!
4553	582	best recipe for banana bread I've used
4554	582	Very tasty and easy. I made it as written and added some chopped pecans just cause I had them. The loaf was gone in 30 minutes. One comment was this was too much work and too many bowls to wash. Really? I find baking relaxing and I have a dishwasher.
4555	583	This is one of the best banana bread recipes i have tried so far and wouldn't change anything at all in my opinion.
4556	583	My favorite Banana Bread ♥️
4557	583	This is a perfect recipe! I used three smaller sized bananas and left mine in for 50 minutes and it turned out incredibly fantastic! The flavor is spot on, you won’t be disappointed!
4558	583	I am a caregiver so I need easy recipes to cook for my clients for the short amount of time that I be with them this recipe was easy to follow and understand and the banana bread turned out delish my compliments to you Joy thank you
4559	583	great, and very simple recipe. the only thing i added some chopped walnuts.
4560	583	It was easy and delicious!
4561	583	Made two loaves, one without and one with nuts, for church function, and it was a hit!  Very moist and tasty!!
4562	583	So easy to make and tastes delicious.  Very moist too!I tripled the recipe and made it in a large, glass baking pan, to share with family!
4563	583	Super easy to make! I read some of the reviews and didn't over mix the batter. I used 3 large bananas and cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup (from 1 cup) as I generally prefer my desserts to be less sweet. Other than the top cracking a bit (I probably put a bit too much baking soda), the banana bread turned out perfect and super tasty. Thank you Joy for sharing this recipe!
4564	584	These muffins are very good.   And simple to make.  I followed the recipe the 1st time exactly.  2nd & 3rd time I added a little cinnamon did half brown/white sugar nuts & blueberries.   Next level
4565	584	I love this incredibly easy recipe! I do recommend that if you add any nuts that you roast them in a pan and make sure they are roughly chopped.
4566	584	I made mine without eggs and instead i put milk  and it worked the same these where so good i loved them!
4567	584	I accidentally left out the sugar the first time I made these!  They were such a hit with coworkers and neighbours that I always omit the sugar now.
4568	584	This recipe should have two eggs, not one.
4569	584	Super easy and super good. Made as is.
4570	584	It was a good stater recipe.  It was missing cinnamon and vanilla. I also used a little brown sugar.
4571	584	I would love to have a recipe that makes more than just a dozen
4572	584	Very easy, doubled recipe, made 30 muffins. Also added walnuts.
4573	585	I made this for my picky 18 month old and he loves it. BUT, I deleted the honey due to his age. Easy way to get good nutrition into him!
4574	585	Hey Becca,I loved this recipe, tasted really good and I don't know if you can realistically mess it up! Very delicious and one of my new favs!
4575	585	Cut it in half and it was perfect!!!! Used two small bananas vs 1.
4576	585	It was so tasty! I had to use water because I was out of milk.  It still tasted so good.
4577	585	Pretty good. Too much peanut butter.
4578	585	W Smoothie tasted just like the one I get at a smoothie shop
4579	585	Delicious! I’m not a big fan of honey, so I substituted honey for agave nectar but otherwise I didn’t change a thing and it was very, very good! I always have a smoothie for breakfast and this was a great way to start the day! I
4580	585	I love this recipe! I also enjoy putting blueberries and cinnamon in it to spice things up
4581	585	I have made this smoothie more times than I can count these last two weeks, and I can’t get enough. I haven’t made any changes (besides halving it to make one big serving), and it’s so tasty. My young kids love it, too. I highly recommend it.
4582	586	I Add 1/2 cup of Applesauce to all my sweet breads,  for added moisture. I have made this with and without and MORE WAS REQUESTED EACH TIME!
4583	586	I don’t have any words for this recipe but awesome, fantastic and out of this world delicious. I didn’t change anything about it. My wife doesn’t even like banana nut bread and she practically ate the whole loaf.
4584	586	This is the best banana bread recipe!  It is super moist and is full of flavor.   The only thing I do differently is that I beat my bananas slightly before folding them into the batter rather than slicing them.  Whenever I bake this for others, I always get asked to share the recipe.
4585	586	I have made this for years and it is always loved. There are a group of friends we meet in Maui every year. They are always in search of the best banana bread on the island. After several years of hearing of their finds, I made them this banana bread. They all agreed it was better than any they could find on the island and ask me to make it every year!
4586	586	Best one out there
4587	586	Added an extra banana. Gone in less than two days. Fantastic!
4588	586	Followed the recipe exactly!  Everyone asks for my banana bread now.  Thanks!
4589	586	Made this several times, as a bread and muffins.  I didn't change anything but I do mash the bananas.
4590	586	Great recipe, have made it several times. Double everything for 2 loaves. The sour cream is the “secret ingredient” that makes the loaves  so smooth in texture and takes just a skosh of sweetness off all the sugar. Try adding a little cinnamon for extra flavor.
4591	587	Soooo good!!! A family favorite! & So easy to make!
4592	587	I’m this is my go to brunch recipe and it’s delicious. I can’t believe it took so long to rate it but I’ve been using it for ages. I usually just omit the walnuts because I don’t like them. I made the last round with vanilla infused bourbon and it was amazing.
4593	587	I had no rum so I used Cointreau. Awesome flavor!  I also flambéed it for fx.
4594	587	Great recipe. Only change I made was Candied pecans instead of walnuts try it it’s phenomenal
4595	587	This was absolutely phenomenal! I did use vodka instead of rum (because that's all I had) but it was still one of the best desserts I've ever had. Thanks for sharing this!
4596	587	Made it and it was delicious. Everyone devoured it. I couldn’t get the flambé to work. Assuming I burned off the alcohol to fast.
4597	587	The only alteration I made to this recipe was I used brandy instead of dark rum because that was what I had on hand and it was delicious! Will definitely make again after I go buy some dark rum!
4598	587	I left the run out. It was really good
4599	587	I made this for years in the restaurant, this is the same recipe we used. With the exception, we served it over pound cake and ice cream.
4600	588	I added banana extract to enhance the banana flavor and made  my crust with vanilla wafers, so simple to make and taste yummy….  I did add whipped cream prior to slicing it..
4601	588	I followed the recipe as is and it was amazing... for people complaining about the filling being to liquid... you probably didn't cook it long enough, cuz my filling was the consistency of pudding and its deliciousness.   Will definitely make it again
4602	588	This does satisfy your sweet tooth but I thought I could avoid the soupy/runny outcome that a lot posted about by using 1/4 c less of the milk and adding part of 1 egg white to the filling mixture. I also cooked the pudding to a thickened paste but I still ended up with a runny filling. Chilled it in the FREEZER for at least 6 hours,  it was not as runny afterwards but still not firm enough for slicing cleanly. The taste is delish so I would make this one again.
4603	588	Followed the recipe exactly-- it is delicious! Family approved- will make again
4604	588	I made it in muffin tin with vanilla wafer on bottom!
4605	588	Culinary Student approved
4606	588	Disgusting.  The pudding mixture turned out great, set very nicely.  The bananas however were black, removed the pudding and meringue to eat, the bananas were inedible.  Will use pudding filling again but with coconut instead.
4607	588	I’ve been making this recipe for years. I do not bake the pie—I use a Nilla Wafer recipe for the crust. The trick to get this custard thick is to heat the dry ingredients (in the pan) before adding the milk. Meaning: Add sugar, flour, salt to the pan and heat at medium heat for a minute or so then add the milk very slowly. Very. Slowly. A little at a time-a quarter cup or less each pour. Whisking throughly and constantly; incorporating fully before adding more milk. I also set the egg yolks out so they’re room temperature before incorporating. I hope this helps! Fantastic recipe! I also have used this custard to make rice pudding and used as substitute for instant vanilla pudding in various recipes. It’s a keeper!!
4608	588	I have made a cream custard pudding very similar to this many times and knew the taste was great and it is.  However I also knew that it would need to be thicker for a pie and used 3.5 T cornstarch instead of the 2T in my pudding recipe.  I read many of the reviews about a soupy mess and was a little concerned. Well the exact thing also happened to me. it turned out thinner than my pudding with same amount of milk and half the cornstarch. Why?  As a Home Economist, I knew there was a reason. My belief is that it was either over cooked (too high a heat) or under stirred. Custards creams can lose their structure with high heat.  Undercooking and under stirring can also be a problem.  I was working in a different kitchen with a lower quality pot and a new stove. I will try again because my thin custard over broken up graham wafer crust in a bowl topped with whipped cream tasted great! Banana cream pudding.  My guests asked for seconds. I gave it 3 stars for the taste.
4609	589	As always, I read the comments first and modified the recipe to suit my tastes. I used Whole Wheat White Flour, stevia, increased the milk to 1 cup (to compensate for whole wheat flour), and added 1sp. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of Nutmeg, and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts. I sprinkled brown sugar on top. They were delicious!
4610	589	My husband and I both found these muffins to be very good. Moist, slightly sweet, and very tasty. I substituted a monkfruit/erythritol blend + 1 tablespoon maple syrup for the sugar, and added approximately 1/3 cup of chopped pecans. If you're counting calories, we came up with 240 each in the app we used, and that was with no white sugar.
4611	589	I gave it a go. I like others though the muffins are a bit tasteless as we are in general used to baking with higher sugar amounts.  I did add 2/3 cup chopped walnuts to bring the flavour up.Friendly critique.😊 Perhaps the muffins were dryer, as I didn’t use refined oatmeal.Thank you for sharing your muffin!
4612	589	Disappointing. I made the for a girls breakfast.  Although they were moist, they were very bland. Not enough sugar or flavor.  Will not use this recipe again.
4613	589	Amazing! Used it a couple of times and they always bake perfectly. Will totally recommend
4614	589	Super easy and yummy! We also used 1:1 gluten free flour as a replacement.
4615	589	I am not a baker and these were so great even with my add ins!  Thank you!
4616	589	So bad. Literally had no flavor. I even added a light powdered sugar glaze and a cinnamon/sugar dusting on top. Still threw them away. Don't bother.
4617	589	Delicious and moist!  Not overly sweet like the traditional recipes I have used in the past.  I added about 3/4 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter and they came out perfect.
4618	590	I have used this recipe for years. It is the only banana bread recipe I will make. It is a hit every time! Makes my house smell so delicious. People will fight over the last piece. I typically have to double this recipe just to make enough loaves that everyone can have at least 2 slices. I would give it 100 stars if I could. Absolutely the best.
4619	590	The best! I follow the recipe and sometimes add dark chocolate chips. Family and friends, love this banana bread!
4681	597	It was good, I doubled it because it says it only makes 2 servings. We ended up with 10 servings. I swapped whole milk for soy milk and it needed 6 tablespoons of sugar. I tried 2 cups of cherry berry mix instead of strawberries, Great flavors!
4620	590	I want to thank you the person that share this recipe.  I love this banana bread, I made it a few times and everybody  loves it.   I make one yesterday, and I decide to share the pics, sometimes I add chocolate chips or cranberries and to this one I add raisins and  came out delicious. I save the recipe, this one is my favorite.
4621	590	This was the easiest recipe I have ever made! It taste really goof. My Goddaughter and I had fun making it. Thank you for sharing!🙏🙏
4622	590	This is the best recipe for banana nut bread I've ever made.   Of course, being from Texas, I use pecans instead of walnuts.  Also added 1 tsp vanilla this time, haven't tasted it yet because the loves are still cooling :).I am thinking about increasing it by half so that the loaves aren't so thin, but this may not be a good idea because the increased baking time may make the outside too done.  Anyone have any thoughts on this?Mine fall so much and leave such a trench in the middle that I think next time I'll add a tsp. of lemon to help the baking soda do it's job.These are kind if nitpicky things - the main thing is it's a great recipe!
4623	590	Never disappoints. I do add about a tsp of cinnamon and half a tsp of nutmeg.
4624	590	Made this using Kirkland unsalted mixed nuts I had on hand.  Very delicious.
4625	590	This is the best banana nut bread, my family loves it!
4626	590	yum
4627	591	It was great!!! I’ve made it 3 times now, once strictly following the recipe, the next time I only had two bananas, so added drained crushed pineapple. My husband loved it, so this time I used bananas, pineapple and coconut, and it was awesome!!!!!  ❤️
4628	591	Excellent. Made 12 perfect large muffins. 10 minutes after serving them to my family, they were asking me to make more!
4629	591	I added a little honey (about a teaspoon) to the bananas since I had to use the oven method to ripen them and was afraid they might not be sweet enough.  I also sprinkled some turbinado cane sugar on top for added sweetness.
4630	591	Made this yesterday, only thing I changed was used pecan since that is what I had on hand. They were so good and moist! This will be my go to recipe for banana muffins from now on.
4631	591	I loved this recipe.  It is so easy to remember and make I made multiple batches. As for taste, so delicious they were all gone in the same day. I made some exactly  as the recipe says and added chocolate chips to some, amazing both ways.
4632	591	Very good!  Added a little sour cream to add moisture and a little additional cinnamon.  Great flavor, whole family enjoyed these muffins.
4633	591	Delicious!
4634	591	What some cooks do not understand, but different parts of the country have different humidity levels thus affecting the product you are cooking. I am from the Midwest or Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas region. For this recipe to be moist here, I always have to add oil, not butter and a four ounce container of applesauce. Yogurt helps only a little. It is generally drier here than other states. So milk or applesauce or some fruit juice works best.
4635	591	This will be my go-to for over-ripe bananas from now on. Just the right crispy top, tender crumb, moist and delicious. And quick and easy.
4636	592	Easy recipe , decided to make a large cake
4637	592	My family LOVES these muffins .. especially warm out of the oven. My only tweak was I used 1 tsp vanilla in the batter as well as a dash or two of cinnamon, simply because we all love those flavors but certainly not necessary!
4638	592	Super easy to make! The only adjustment I made was using 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar in the bread. I honestly would give this recipe a 4 but my Honey ate 4 and said it was the best banana bread/muffin he’d ever eaten!
4639	592	This recipe caught my eye because it called for 3 bananas (i see many with only 2) and that's what I had to start with. The crumb topping sounded extra yummy.  The recipe I did not change at all. However, I think it is for jumbo muffins and I used regular. So to my surprise, I had a lot more mix and broke out a second muffin pan and made 18. In doing this I did adjust the cooking time so they wouldn't burn. The prep time (let's be real... 15 minutes is having everything premeasured and in front of you ready to go)  it's more like 30-40 minutes and that's me cleaning as I go - putting dirty things in the dishwasher, not actually washing. I had a cooking time of 16 minutes (I like my muffins on the light and moist side). It was exactly 1 hour from start to finish turning the oven off. Cooling time was additional. I took them out of the muffin tins after 5 minutes so they wouldn't keep cooking. And they were deeelicious!!!
4640	592	Loved this recipe. Better than anything store bought. Made mini muffin versions, about 28 mini muffins. Cooked at 350°F for 22 minutes. Used 1 tbsp of cinnamon. Turned out scrumptious.
4641	592	This was an amazing recipe!!  Kids loved the crumb topping.
4642	592	Husband and kids love it
4643	592	Absolutely delicious and a I will definitely make these again.  I added a little milk for moistness. I made 5 full size muffins instead of cupcake size and baked for 25-28 minutes.
4644	592	This is an easy banana muffin recipe. There’s another recipe that I use on this site which is identical except that one adds cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, which I like. But I did like the crumb topping on these. Moist, delicious and if you let the batter rest for a few minutes before filling the muffin tins you will get a nice high crown.
4645	593	Great cake, everyone loved it. very moist. I doubled checked the oven temperature and I thought 275 was low.  However, it was perfect for this cake. I have a slow oven that took 90 minutes, instead of 60. I used a glass pan and could see it brown slowly.
4646	593	I have made this cake several times over the years. I make it exactly as instructed, but add a little bit more buttermilk probably 1 cup but I also didn't properly measure the flour out. Alao I add walnuts. It comes out absolutely perfectly delicious every time.Thank you for the recipe. There are many factors when it comes to baking that cause different outcomes. Ovens, altitude, ingredient quality, possible overbeating, not properly measuring flour ect ......Thank you again and best of luck to all!
4647	593	My daughter requests this cake every year for her birthday.  Now, my son-in-law is requesting it as well.  It's a huge hit with the family!!!
4682	597	I used almond milk instead and no suger.i also added plain yogurt .I feel it didn't need any sugar.o ya I also added chia seeds
4683	597	I added mixed berries and pineapple to the recipe. No sugar or vanilla. It's sweet enough. Great recipe! Filling too!
4684	597	Loved it! Added teaspoon of vanilla extract instead of 1/2 and also 2 tablespoons of sugar, made it so much more rich!
4685	597	It was pretty good! The only thing I can dock this recipe on is possibly the addition of the oats. It does add a slightly grainier texture to the smoothie, but I don't mind this personally. Some might, hence why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.
4648	593	This cake was a hit when I made it last weekend!  We're talking eyes-rolling-back-into-their-heads and moans-of-delight delicious!  This is a heavier cake - not something light and fluffy that you'd get out of a box mix - which is exactly what it should be.  The only thing that was off for me was the oven time.  I've heard living in different places can affect cooking times so, if it does make any difference I live in Pennsylvania.  For me, I used a disposable aluminum tray and the cake needed to bake at 275 degrees for about an hour and a half, until the sides were just starting to come away from the tray.My only "complaint" about this recipe, not even enough for it to affect my rating of five stars, is the frosting.  For me, it was a little bit too sweet.  I'd probably cut back the confectioners sugar to 2-1/2 cups next time.Other than that, this cake was perfect and my family can't wait for me to make it again!
4649	593	I accidentally cooked at 375 degrees for 40 min and it came out wonderful. I only noticed after the fact that it listed 275 degrees temp.
4650	593	Perfect!
4651	593	Great recipe. I made this for a holiday party. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture for a touch of holiday spice. I only used 1 3/4 cups of white sugar as we don't like overly sweet desserts. I thought the cream cheese frosting was a bit too sweet so next time I will make it with; 2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, ½ cup unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar. This is the recipes I use for carrot cake and like it much better.
4652	593	I followed the suggestion of replacing 1 cup of using 1 cup of brown sugar for the white.  This cake was perfection
4653	593	This is absolutely Delish!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!  Enjoy!!!
4654	594	This recipe was not only delicious but also unbelievably simple and easy to follow
4655	594	Delicious!! I drink this a few times a week now after workouts. I use 2tsp cocoa powder otherwise it is a little overpowering. I also recommend using gold standard whey protein chocolate as the protein powder.
4656	594	Flavor is great. Texture is too runny for me and it wasn’t cold enough. Next time I made it, I froze the banana in slices first, and doubled the ice cubes, and it came out colder and thicker which is my personal preference (more like a milkshake consistency). Delicious with these modifications. Came in handy for liquid diet after dental procedure. Nice and filling
4657	594	Thanks, it's creamy goodness 🤎Added chia seeds and 1 cup waterSubstituted*milk with 1 tablespooon Hemp powder*frozen banana instead of ice*no honey(Add oats on diff days and half peanut butter. Filling boost!)*
4658	594	good healthy delicous
4659	594	Very good and easy to make.
4660	594	This is really good! I added half the amount of peanut butter and it was still great. Good texture and great taste.
4661	594	Extremely smooth and creamy.  I used almond milk instead of cow's which probably added to the overall nutrition profile. I think I'll use more banana next time because I'm only getting a faint hint of it. Overall a filling, healthy breakfast or snack.
4662	594	Great recipe, thank you so much!  I made it without the honey and it was plenty sweet .  Will make again for sure!
4663	595	I love it ♡I didn't use all of the ingredients listed but I used; 1 cup banana, 1 cup strawberries, about 1 cup Chobani Vanilla Greek Yogurt, 4 tablespoons OJ & I put tasteless Collage Peptides in mine too.I will use this recipe again, it's ezpzbrze to remember & very yummy 😋
4664	595	Came out yummy.... thank you so much for the super simple smoothie recipe for the kids and me to make!
4665	595	it is good
4666	595	Love this simple delicious smoothie. I used fat-free plain yogurt and it was perfect. I also threw in a few mango chunks only because I had mango on hand. Will definitely make this again!
4667	595	YUMMM!!  I added some blackberries and graham cracker crumbles.  So good!  Will be making again for sure, adding my chia seeds too.
4668	595	It’s wonderful, I made it for my family and they loved it!!!! The only thing I might add would be to made more the suggested, because of small portions.
4669	595	First smoothie I've ever made. Came out great. Was thick and tasted great. I used honey instead of white sugar and tried out some chia seeds. Highly recommend
4670	595	It was good. Definitely would benefit with more pineapple and orange juice, and likely a little more yogurt and milk. Otherwise, good and simple smoothie to make.
4671	595	Absolutely delicious!
4672	596	This has been my go to banana pudding recipe and we devour it! I follow the recipe exactly as written.
4673	596	My family loves this recipe. The only thing I do differently is I make my own whipped cream and I don’t add the sugar to it. The pudding is sweet enough to compensate.
4674	596	This is extremely EASY to make and very good too!  It's definitely a "sweet-tooth" person's dessert as it's very, very sweet.
4675	596	Best Banana Pudding ever. Star Food of any party or potluck.
4676	596	I’ve made this recipe dozens of times for years now and it’s always a crowd pleaser! I actually think this sealed the deal on my husband wanting to marry me. Follow the recipe exactly like it says! ROOM TEMP cream cheese! Even if it’s not exactly room temp yet, beat it with an electric whisk attachment and it will eventually be smooth. FOLD, not mix in ROOM TEMP whip cream! Make sure the pudding is INSTANT! Lastly, no need at all for banana flavored pudding… too artificial tasting. Only slight modification is that I use the whole box of Nilla Waffers and crush leftovers on top. Stick with these ingredients and trust me, it will be the best banana pudding you’ve ever had.
4677	596	My pudding mixture was runny! I think I just ruined banana pudding for the 1st time in my life. This is a huge disappointment. Mine was like banana soup! :(
4678	596	This was delicious!! For the past reviewers who had a watery outcome, I experienced this too and I figured out why! I accidentally bought the "cook and serve" instant pudding. Since I had already bought all the ingredients and made it this far I decided to heat the mixture to boiling like the pudding box instructions said and then put it in the freezer about 20ish minutes to cool. That thickened it right up! Next I added the cool whip and followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out great!  Friendly note to future people thinking about making this, pay super close attention to the instant pudding box size and instant pudding prepping method and it will turn out perfect!
4679	596	My favorite 😍 banana pudding!! Yummy!!
4680	596	This has become my go to banana pudding recipe. I have been asked so often to make it, I can't tell you the last time I actually got to eat some of it!
4933	625	Loved it! I added chocolate chips. It was so good.
4686	597	I love oatmeal , bananas and strawberries ! Delicious ! I use Oatmilk though , I can’t drink the soy milk at all , I use the unsweetened version of the oatmilk and it makes any smoothie taste great !
4687	597	I added protein powder, chia seeds, skipped on the white sugar and still delicious.
4688	597	Delicious!  I took other reviewers’ advice and blended up the oats first.  I added white beans for protein.  It was really smooth and tasted like a milkshake!
4689	597	This is probably the best strawberry oatmeal smoothie I've had in a long time! I don't have a powerful blender, but 1/2 a cup of oatmeal turned out to be just fine (if you blend the milk and oatmeal first, you shouldn't have a problem with graininess --or just blend the oatmeal into a powder before you add the other stuff). I tossed in a handful of spinach and used vanilla protein powder instead of vanilla and sugar, since it was a post-workout smoothie, and it tasted amazing.
4690	598	Very good.  I cut the sugar and used evaporated milk instead of buttermilk.
4691	598	Easy, moist and delicious. A great way to use up ripe bananas.
4692	598	The baking soda should not be 1 tablespoon. The banana cake is very bitter. I think should be 2x 1/4 tsp only.
4693	598	Oh boy, can a cake be too good?  I had way too many bananas, so used this batter in the Banana Upside Down Cake, omitting the nuts since the upside down cake had pecans.  Half went into a small bundt pan and the other half in a round cake pan.  Sooo good!!  As others have said, the texture is much lighter compared to Banana Loaf.  I left the bananas lumpy and it is super moist.
4694	598	I've been looking for a banana cake recipe I've tired of the more dense bread recipes.Please don't shoot me for making changes but I didn't have any choice.I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1 tbs vinegar and the remainder of whole milk to make one cup.I always measure flour heavy so I have to make an adjustment to correct for this either hold back some of the dry ingredients or add additional wet. I used the entire cup of milk to achieve the proper batter thickness. I didn't have any walnuts.The cake is very moist and delicious!If you have a hot oven definitely make the adjustment not the middle of the cake won't be thoroughly baked.Very good recipe
4695	598	I made muffins instead of a cake and they taste delicious. My husband loved them! I’ve added a teaspoon  of cinnamon and crushed pecan!However I’ll bake it with 4 bananas next time instead of 3, I couldn’t really taste the banana. And I found that it was a bit too sweet so I’ll slightly reduce the quantity of sugar.But overall, great recipe ! Thank you 🙏🏽
4696	598	Easy and Delicious
4697	598	One of my favorite cakes to make and it runs out great each time . Only thing is I always need to bake it for more time than what’s mentioned in the recipe . Any idea why it takes about 45-50 mins for me instead of the 30 mins
4698	598	Best banana cake ever. Super moist and super yummy.
4699	599	I give this a 5 star. I have used this recipe for many years. I used to think my mother's was the best. But this has become my go to now. I add lemon juice and an extra splash of vanilla. But overall, this is the best for me and the many who ask me to make one for them, or ask for the recipe.
4700	599	This is a fantastic recipe. It’s very moist. I reduced the sugar by 1 Cup and added two cups of chocolate chips. Definitely a keeper!
4701	599	Super moist tasty banana bread!  Loved the dusting of the pan with the cinnamon sugar.  Made 1/2 recipe and shared a loaf with the neighbors who also raved about it!  Keeping this one!!!
4702	599	THE BEST BANANNA BREAD......EVER !!!!  Easy to make.
4703	599	This is my go to for banana bread! All my friends and family love it!
4704	599	fantastic and a big enough recipe to share with friends!
4705	599	I make this recipe regularly.  I always hear, "This is the best banana bread I have ever had!"  This is definitely a go to recipe.
4706	599	This truly is the most amazing recipe! What makes it the best ever is lining the pans with sugar and cinnamon AND the sour cream add. When I gift these loaves, friends are always excited!
4707	599	Great recipe, but makes a lot of bread.  I 1/2 the recipe and poured it into a pudding ring, and also made 6 cupcakes.I also made the sour cream using heavy cream and lemon juice (and a pinch of salt).
4708	600	We’re going vegan, so I substituted apple sauce for the eggs. Turned great, very moist!
4709	600	I did not notice when I was making this that there is no salt in the recipe, so we thought they were quite bland.  Very very moist.
4710	600	My family loves this recipe. I add extra bananas!!  Yummy!!!
4711	600	I used butter in place of margarine. Added a half cup of dark brown sugar. More banana doesn't hurt the bread at all. Added  tsp. vanilla, sometimes a Tbs of spiced rum. sprinkle nuts on top before baking. Delish bread recipe!
4712	600	This is the recipe my Mom used starting before 1948 when my sister was born. It is critical to let the batter rest for 15 minutes. That's how it comes out high. So many people make it goopy and I don't like it. It's especially good fresh out of the oven and cooled just until warm.
4713	600	I made this in a bundt pan & I added a lil more banana, more like 2 cups. Omg it tastes sooo good. A perfect crust & a moist delectable interior. My whole house smells like bananas lol. Absolutely delicious.
4714	600	I loved this recipe I even added a layer of banana slices in the middle to keep it moist and add an extra boost of flavor.
4715	600	I used butter instead of margarine and added walnuts but the result came out a bit on the dry side with not much banana taste.
4716	600	Super easy recipe to follow. The cake came out delicious and I got high marks from loved ones. The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 was because some baked goods aren’t complete without adding the beautiful combo of vanilla essence, fresh grated nutmeg and ground cinnamon powder - I think that’s what makes it the best, better than all the shop bought stuff. So, while I followed the how-to of the recipe I knew I had to add the extra flavour, which the recipe did not consider.
4717	601	I love this recipe.  It was super easy to make with my portable blender cup I got from www dot theblendaway dot com.  They even give a free 50 easy healthy smoothie receipe book with every purchase.
4718	601	The flavor was actually better than expected considering it’s just spinach and banana.I used regular milk because that’s what I had on hand. I think next time I’ll add some ice cubes—I like my smoothies to be cold—and also some yogurt or something for a little extra thickness.Overall, not bad. It’s a very plain smoothie and I wouldn’t have it every day but it serves a purpose.
4719	601	This was tasty. I did make some minor additions with pea protein, a teaspoon of macha powder, 5 small chlorella tablets, and the tiniest piece of ginger.
4720	601	I would suggest adding protein powder. Without this adjustment, I could still taste the spinach and it was mildly unpleasant. With this adjusment, its a healthy and a suprisingly yummy drink.
4721	601	Substituted milk for international delight vanilla iced coffee,  now I have a banana,  vanilla  flavored smoothie. Can't taste the spinach and I used a bit more than the recipe called for. I'll be making this again.
4722	601	It was GREAT!!!
4723	601	Delicious.
4724	601	Its pretty good I made changes I did add spinach, banana, almond milk and oatmeal and it turns out Delicious
4725	601	Used regular 2% milk and loved it!
4726	355	Was one of the best i have had yet.  I'm not big on smoothies but this one is one i can handle.
4727	355	Very versatile--I also throw in a hand full of fresh spinach.
4728	355	Made this for lunch today, we had a peach that needed to be used and all the other ingredients! Threw everything in the blender and it's delicious. I added a couple of scoops of vanilla flavored protein since we were having it as a meal replacement. Thank you for the excellent smoothie!
4729	355	I added a banana.  Liked it but will continue to try adding other fruits.  This was my first ever smoothie. I'm hooked. I'm sure I'll be making plenty more.
4730	355	Super easy, super yummy, super fruity! I used V8 Peach Mango juice and it is very healthy.
4731	355	This is the hard way to make a smoothie. We use frozen fruit right from the freezer. No need to add anything else.  You can get an amazing variety of single and mixed fruit. So delicious!
4732	355	Made it with the suggested fruits and the only change I made was to add vanilla yogurt instead of juice which made it creamy.
4733	355	Our first try EVER making smoothies and this was our first stop for a recipe. We had everything minus the mango juice,but it tasted a little  sour so we added honey to give it a boost of sweet, not much but some! Thanks for the recipe, we will be testing  W/ other fruits as well.
4734	355	Love smoothies. I used mango strawberry and Banana. Left out the juice though. and added some greek yogurt.
4735	603	Super yummy! My father in laws favorite cake
4736	603	I thought this was an AWESOME SIMPLE DESSERT. I used just strawberries no bananas one time. The other time all pineapple but added coconut awww man. Definitely nothing to sneak and eat thru the night.
4737	603	It's simple and delicious! Great cold tree!!
4738	603	I love it. I did add Carmel and chocolate toppings and it was amazing
4739	603	Super easy to make.  Instead of on 9x13 cake, I made recipe in two 8x8 square pans (served at two different parties), covered with plastic wrap then a tight wrap with aluminum foil and froze them.  Took out of freezer 2 hours before serving and it was delicious.  There was none left after both parties.  Super delicious.  I did use the suggestions of a few other members by using banana cream instant pudding, peanut butter Magic Shell, chopped walnuts in one and chopped pecans in the other then drizzled more Magic Shell on top of maraschino cherries.  I have never seen adults take two to three huge helpings.  It was THAT GOOD!!
4740	603	I make this dessert every holiday and special occasions. It very easy to make and my family loves it
4741	603	I made it exactly as the recipe is written with only two changes. I used the suggestion to freeze the crumb layer before adding the cream cheese layer- but only did so for a half hour while preparing the rest of the ingredients. That was an excellent idea because the cream cheese spread easily without mixing with the crumbs.  I also added chocolate syrup (as you see) after I saw that idea on one of the pics.  Definitely not necessary but who doesn’t love extra calories?!?   I haven’t tasted it yet since I’m bringing it to a dinner party tonight; but obviously it’s going to be a huge sensation!  I’ll add another pic after it’s served!  Update:  Yes!  It’s a keeper!  The added photos show extra chocolate syrup and how easily and cleanly the dessert cut.  Not messy or gooey.
4742	603	Looks and smells great!  I am taking it to work tomorrow for a party.  I'm sure it will be good!
4743	603	I used pecans instead of peanuts.
4744	604	Loved this recipe.  I've made it several times, my family loves them.
4745	604	I made as per recipe and they were very dry.
4746	604	I thought it was really good, I used a mix of milk and white chocolate chips. I can’t really taste the bananas, but it was still really good.
4747	604	So moist and chocolatey. Have made it over and over.
4748	604	Amazing 🤩
4749	604	I followed the recipe almost to the letter and it was perfect! The only change I made was adding 1/3 cup of regular size chocolate chips instead of mini chips. My husband and kids loved it. I might add some chopped nuts to the top next time I make these. Thank you for sharing!
4750	604	Made the recipe as written. Can't think of single thing I would change!Lovely chocolate flavor, but it didn't hide the banana flavor. Perfectly balanced. Thank you for a delicious, easy and fast recipe to use up overripe bananas!
4751	604	I used this recipe in my mini donut maker and added some vanilla glaze once I was done. I thought they were really good. The banana flavor didn't stand out a lot but I could still taste it.
4752	604	hi guys love this recipe. made cake instead of muffins. turned out perfectly
4753	605	My husband loves these.  They are easy to make.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. (Aloha from Hawaii.)
4754	605	I made this recipe using some modifications based on the comments and what I had on hand / my preferences. With my changes, it really is  a different recipe, but the original recipe was great as a base and helped me to create delicious muffins without butter (which was the goal - I'm completely out!).-subbed canola oil for 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup melted coconut oil-cut white sugar down to 1/2 cup-subbed coconut milk for oat milk-added chocolate chips (to only half the batter)-omitted cinnamon and nutmegThe muffins rose beautifully and were plenty sweet without the extra sugar (even those without chocolate chips!). I ended up with 12 regular sized muffins and 24 mini muffins. I baked them for about 25 minutes and they were perfect.
4755	605	I have been making these muffins for a year now. They are absolutely the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever tried! I don't measure the bananas- usually have about 5 on hand to use, I use the refrigerated coconut milk (not sure if that makes any difference), and I add a couple of handfuls of chopped nuts. It usually makes 2 dozen muffins. When I take them places, I am asked for the recipe! You can also make mini muffins (great for baby showers, etc.)- cook for 18 minutes. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!
4964	628	I love the idea of adding the cinnamon to the blender. I used to sprinkle my banana shake with it but mixing it is definitely yummier.
4756	605	So, so good! I did 1 cup total sugar (1/2 white, 1/2 brown), used 3 bananas and subbed the oil for unsweetened applesauce. Also added chopped walnuts. Delish!!! Made about 18 muffins.
4757	605	New family favorite. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup.
4758	605	This is a great base recipe, but as others have said it has WAY too much sugar and oil. I used half a cup of rapadura sugar and a teaspoon of stevia, and substituted half a cup of sunflower oil and half a cup of whatever non-dairy milk I had and and they were plenty sweet and moist enough. I also add things like rhubarb, or carob nibs or walnuts.On the issue of bone char, sugar isn't refined this way in Australia so we have no issue regarding whether sugar is vegan or not. I
4759	605	I did what one other reviewer did and replaced the canola oil with 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup coconut oil. if you do this be sure to melt the oil after you measure it was pretty hard to stir. also ran out of brown sugar so i added about 1tbsp molasses to 1/2 cup white sugar. they took about 26 minutes to bake and i ended up with 20 perfectly baked muffins.
4760	605	The muffins came out beautiful and delicious!I exchanged the coconut milk for soy milk and put in a cup of chocolate chips
4761	605	Easy peasy, always a winner
4762	606	Great recipe! It is delicious. I have had it in the morning as a regular smoothie and have also added vanilla vodka to it for an evening cocktail.
4763	606	really good!, i dont know if this is bad, but i did put some homeade iced foam into it, the two mixed together kind of clash, but the smoothie itself is amazing!!!
4764	606	Only different thing I did was add coconut water ( my pineapples were already in the jar with it ). Super easy, great taste. Thank You
4765	606	This is scrumptious! However, it has far too much sugar for my low sugar diet.
4766	606	Couldn't be any easier! Delish!
4767	606	This was awesome I will definitely try this again! I had BLTs for dinner and this smoothie it was awesome!
4768	606	I think this is an ok recipe. I didn't hate it but I didn't think it was super wow. This is good for helping with weight loss if needed.
4769	606	Very refreshing on a hot, summer day!
4770	606	It was great! A good way to use up pineapple. very different from the usual strawberry and banana smoothie.
4771	607	Good recipe! This was my first time making muffins. I did make a few changes for personal preference: 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and a bit of cinnamon, plus some chocolate chips. It is the perfect pastry 🥧
4772	607	It was amazing! I added an extra banana and a half and pecans instead of walnuts [allergies], and me and my family loved them  5 stars.
4773	607	Loved it! However, I added some things based on the little flavor that seemed to exist in the original recipe… 1/4 teaspoon each of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Also about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Dusted the top with cinnamon, nutmeg, and powdered sugar.
4774	607	I half the sugar with brown sugar and watch the time I think it took 15-16 mins but were very tasty and also did the coconut
4775	607	This is exactly the recipe I was looking for, thanks!I made a couple of adaptations:• I used  only 1/2 the sugar (as I always do)• I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips• I also added 1/4 cup chia seeds, but that only added nutrition, not texture or flavor
4776	607	THIS RECIPE WAS AMAZINGGG
4777	607	Quick and easy. I modified by using gluten free baking flour and also added 1/4 tsp vanilla. Delicious!
4778	607	I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out so well. Every muffin was the same size and color! The taste was exactly like eating a slice of banana bread.
4779	607	I did add a bit of vanilla and some 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. No walnuts. Made smaller cup cake size, cook time was 350 for 23 minutes, probably could have been 20.
4780	608	The best tanks to the best air fryer I've ever wanted. Was never a big fan of air fryers. Until today's times and she's.
4781	608	I want to alter my comments of earlier. I did have a fire in my kitchen. The lesson is to not have the parchment paper in the air fryer as it's preheating and only use it to cover the bottom.
4782	608	These taste really good!! I added a pinch of pink himalayan salt to bring out the sweetness and cooked mine a little longer than 10 minutes.
4783	608	Parchment paper didn't stay put in the air fryer and kept the banana from browning. Amost burned the paper. The banana ended up sticky and gooey
4784	608	Second time I made it I removed the parchment paper. I liked it much better without.
4785	608	Worked out as expected.  It's all in the spice and that's up to you.  Have fun and thanks for all your precious time!!!
4786	608	I personally give it three stars, but my two teenage kids and wife all give it five stars. I did not have avocado oil, so I just used canola oil
4787	608	Tastes awesome. I used ripe plantains to serve as a side dish.  With bananas I like to sprinkle a dust of cinnamon and it makes a great dessert with vanilla ice cream.
4788	608	I made these again today but I cut them 1/2" thick and air fried them for 8 minutes at 375 degrees. I flipped them over and cooked them 3 minutes more. I prefer these thicker slices over the thinner ones.
4789	609	IThe cookies were very good. I used gluten free flour and they were delicious
4790	609	These cookies are amazing! They taste so amazing with the banana and chocolate mix. Super easy to make and great for any season, occasion or a just because I want to bake!
4791	609	This is my second batch everyone loves em.
4792	609	This recipe was perfect! Unfortunately, I didn't have any chocolate chips but as a substitute folded in some walnuts. Made this recipe both ways so far and tasted just as good 👍
4793	609	I did not read the reviews 1st (silly me) i did preheat my oven to 400⁰ which I felt was wayyy to high, so i overcooked 1st batch, so i than decided tobputy 2nd batch in 2 minutes less still I found still a bit over cooked not as bad as the 1st batch, so 3rd and 4th batch are now in the oven at 350⁰ for 12 minutes. 👌
4794	609	I like the chewiness of this cookie!
4795	609	Halved the baking powder/soda, put 4 bananas instead of 3 because it was about to be thrown away and baked at 180 celsius. These small changes should not have resulted in gummy cookies but that's exactly what happened and it was terrible. I like toffee-like cookies, not the risen, gummy type.
4796	609	I did what other reviews suggested and added only 1 teaspoon of baking powder and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  When hot, these have a more pronounced banana taste, which mellows as they cool.  However, they became moist in my cookie tin and were unpleasant because of that.  I won't be making these again.
4797	609	Someone said 400 degrees was too hot for a cookie so I thought about it while I was creaming my butter. Off the top of my head i thought about Russian tea cakes/Mexican wedding cookies that cook at 400 although I think off the top of my head it's only 9 minutes. I only went through a few reviews and didn't see others having a problem with it so I decided to go with the 400. It worked out fine! Also, I used a silicone baking mat instead of greasing the pan. I also love a variety of different kinds of cookies from shortbread to chocolate crinkle (like a brownie) so a cake like cookie is fine with me but I'm glad i was warned. It is very cake like. I think it would be a great cookie to serve at a family brunch.
4798	610	Very delicious  made half with a little cinnamon sugar on top, the other half with some mini chocolate chips.  I use a small ice cream scoop to fill the muffin tins. 😊  Thanks
4799	610	Classic recipe.  Consistent every time. I sometimes substitute 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (with 1 c regular) and always add 1/2 c frozen blueberries or 1/2 c chocolate chips.
4800	610	Easy and quick, they came out soft and moist.  Toothpick was clean at 12:00 so I pulled them.  Came out great.  I used a piping bag for filling the pan.
4801	610	These are so yummy thanks for the great recipe! I followed it exact except I only used two bananas instead because it’s all I had! It made 24 mini muffins but I think my mini muffin pan was a little bigger maybe? and I filled them too full but all turned out perfect in the end :)
4802	610	My go to recipe. I added the 1/4 c. Whipped cream, 1tsp of vanilla, 1tsp of nutmeg and chocolate chips -
4803	610	So tasty!
4804	610	I cut this recipe in half, added blueberries, heavy whipping cream, vanilla extract and separated about about 3 tsps of sugar out and used it to top the muffins before popping them in the muffin.  I baked them for 13 minutes and they were perfect done.  I’m giving this recipe 4 starts since I think the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg would have been welcomed to add a little complexity.  I plan to serve this with a little cinnamon and sugar butter on the side.
4805	610	I am enjoying my muffins! This recipe is now in my favorites.
4806	610	I love this recipe so easy and simple they came out great ! I added some Cinnamon Sugar to the ingredients and sprinkled some on top along with some crushed walnuts ! Delicious
4807	611	I agree with other posters about not using while eggs.  I used 3 yolks only, beat them and then tempered with thickened liquid, and added back slowly while whisking.  Perfection
4808	611	Very easy, and simple to make. Pretty good!
4809	611	The best. Taste like grammas old fashioned banana pudding.
4810	611	The pudding was amazing! I used castor sugar by accident, and my pudding didn't quite thicken up properly so maybe that had something to do with it. But it was delicious all the same! It was a bit like a trifle with bananas and custard; very good.
4811	611	Awesome recipe! First time making homemade pudding! Used only egg yolks and it turned out perfect!
4812	611	What a great recipe! I only used the yolks and saved the whites for meringue. I also used half and half instead of milk. Thick and smooth!
4813	611	Easy to make Grand kids loved  it
4814	611	Great I added a meringue topping and it disappeared in seconds.
4815	611	My family loves this recipe also ! Thanks Sara
4816	612	This recipe is a great start due to the spice balance.  A few people complained about it not baking properly.  I believe there is too much liquid.  I heeded to the warnings, and I used only 1 cup of pumpkin and brown sugar instead of honey.  It came out great after baking on 400 for 10 minutes, then reducing to 350 for 45 min.
4817	612	I only had 3 very ripe never frozen bananas and a supply of fresh pumpkin that never runs out. I am constantly trying new recipes to enjoy my pumpkins with and have been trying to find and get what I got here tonight when I slightly modified this recipe by substituting honey with Lakanto Maple Flavored Syrup, and vegetable oil with margarine. Added ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, just a touch of all spice. Doubled the batch one banana shy and cooked in a few different size pans. I just ate half of the smallest one, I have finally after years found and obtained the  outcome I was looking for!
4818	612	I think vanilla should have been added to pull more flavor out. I agree with others that cook time is off. I think I had it in and out of oven for about an hour and a half.
4819	612	Inside is raw and outside is burnt. This makes so much batter I have no idea how they can say to use one loaf pan. I think if decided into 2 it might cook properly... the flavor is pretty bla also although I don't info that it's not super sweet. Anyway, skip this one don't waste your ubf z
4820	612	I LOVE this recipe. It's a household staple.I use white wheat, do not add dried fruit or nuts inside the bread, and sprinkle the top with pumpkin seeds and brown sugar.
4821	612	Good flavor.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of oil, only one egg, and three bananas.  I'll make this one again!
4822	612	came out nice! i was just using this recipe as a base. didnt add raisins or walnuts. added a tsp of vanilla, more cinnamon, used almond flour and monkfruit sweetener instead of honey and regular sugar. very good!
4823	612	Very nice recipe.  I followed the advice to lower temp to 325 and baked for about 65 minutes total.  I didn't have allspice, so used nutmeg and cardamom instead.  Very moist!
4824	612	The cook time or something in the recipie is definitely off. I'd read reviews so tried to proactively adjust time and eventually heat but after an hour and a half the top of the bread is burnt while the inside is still gooey. The bread is very dense on the edges where it's actually cooked and it doesn't have a lot of flavor. I added a little cream cheese frosting to the top of the bread that was cooked which added a nice flavor. Overall I'm not a fan I'd recommend using a different recipie.
4825	613	Dry, my machine doesn’t have the option to stop. It didn’t bake all the way on the light crust setting, had to put it in the oven for 20 more minutes at 350. I’ll make french toast with it.
4826	613	A bit dry, not a typical bread loaf. More of a dry cake. Had to add half cup flour as mixture is gooey.
4827	613	Dry…. Not a good recipe
4828	613	Brilliant and simple this is my first attempt but I will deffo do again. Next time I will pre mash the banana before adding
4829	613	Cake with a crust. I forgot to consider how sweet americans make everything! As is, not suitable for the old Sunbeam Cool Touch Bakehouse bread-maker. After the recommended 5min mixing I had to scrape around the pan to pull in dry ingredients. My very soft bananas didn't break up sufficiently so I have gooey banana voids throughout the "bread" that look very unappealing. Edible though... with enough butter or maybe cream cheese to cut some of the sweetness.
4830	613	Thanks for this. It was super easy. I cooked for an extra ten but probably only needed an extra 5. Much easier to cook than the one I do in the oven which never seems to bake consistently. Looks lovely too.
4831	613	Added walnuts
4832	613	It was a hit!I did have to cook it a little longer. I added 20 minutes and t came out perfectly
4833	613	Easy to follow plus I added chocolate chips as well!
4834	614	All in all it was good easy recipe to follow they came out pretty good my kids like them my grandkids liked them and I would have taken a picture of them except that the kids had him before I could take a picture of them LOL anyways it's a good recipe it's easy so that's my take on it thank you
4835	614	Was very densed maybe my baking powder lost its strength or maybe the temperature here in the Caribbean
4836	614	The fritters had a good flavor. I ran into the same problem as some other viewers with the insides being under cooked. I will definitely make again.
4837	614	A good base recipe. I substituted 2 tablespoons of sour cream for the melted margarine and added an extra banana (would probably add 2 if I made again) 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cloves, ginger, and nutmeg. Glazed with 1 cup of powdered sugar mixed with about a tablespoon of milk to get the right consistency and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Lots of flavor to complement the banana.
4838	614	It was ok, nothing too exciting.  Just banana pancakes.  Probably won't make this again.
4839	614	I read the reviews before trying this recipe. I wanted to do something with my over ripened bananas other than banana nut bread.  I followed the directions, and made the suggestion from the reviews and used four bananas. I cooked them different ways, deep fried, pancakes, pan fried in a little oil, and baked. They taste good but no matter how I cooked them, they were not appealing to the eye. I won't usr this recipe again.
4840	614	Very easy recipe to pull together if you have some bananas ready!  I used vegetable oil as an egg substitute and they turned out fine. (Photo is pre-sugar added
4841	614	The came out well, but the only thing I can recommend with this recipe is, substitute the flour for pancake mix.  Everyone loved them.  Sprinkled powdered sugar on top.
4842	614	I add one cup cake flour sifted and one beaten egg. 3 tablespoons sugar. 1/2 cup sparkling soda. And a little more to get thin not so thick batter. Dash of salt. Baking powder as mentioned.  Not any milk. 2 tablespoon melted butter. Cut each banana into thirds. Roll in cornstarch then batter and fry. Coat after with sifted powder sugar. Delicious. Heat up oil while mixing everything
4843	615	I liked it, added about a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon.
4844	615	The recipe for blueberry banana bread is amazingly delicious.Definitely will make again! .
4845	615	Added walnuts and cooked two minis and one small loaf pan. Minis were 40 minutes and loaf was 45 minutes. I think a half to one teaspoon of baking powder would be a good addition.
4846	615	It was very good, I did have to bake it longer
4847	615	The bread came out fluffy and moist! I tried it for the first time and it's excellent! I did somehow made these changes:1. 1 cup AP flour + 1 cup oat flour instead of  2 cups of AP flour.2. 1/2 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1 full cup of white sugar (still it came out very sweet so I suggested to reduce it even more.3. Added 1 spoon of whole fat milk4. Buttered 2 regular aluminum baking foil pans and dusted brown sugar + cinnamon powder at the bottom and at the top of the bread (highly recommended!)5. Coated the blueberries with flour so that it won't sink6. Added chopped walnuts for some crunch and 1 medium banana slices for topping decoration7. It definitely took over 45 minutes to bake it, I guess every oven is different.
4848	615	great bread!
4849	615	Followed recipe, except I only had frozen blueberries, which I thawed and rinsed. Used an 8 loaf mini pan and baked for 30 minutes. Perfection.
4850	615	I made this GF using 1 on 1 King Arthur flour. It turned out well, but I had to cook it longer -- about 12 minutes.
4851	615	Very easy to bake! It turned out very fluffy and light, if that's what you want. I halfed the recipe and cooked it for 25 minutes (cook 30 to 35 since I like it a bit raw) and it turned out perfect! I added my own chocolate chips and it tasted fantastic! I will be making this again! :D
4852	616	Being relatively new to low-fat cooking, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome for this recipe.
4853	616	4.5 if I could becuase Like others said it has a little rubbery texture but still tastes great! I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Alsoi sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top for a nice sweet crust. My kids loved it which is a plus. They added whipped cream on top. I am always looking for low to no fat recipes becuase I have gallstones and can't have fat.
4854	616	I really enjoy Banana Bread but sometimes they can be heavy and full of yummy calories.  I love this recipe and will make it again. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, added nutmeg and cinnamon (just a dash) I added salt as well along with vanilla and Almond Extract.  Disappointedly I didn't have walnuts but used pecans instead.  It was/is delicious!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!Tip: Don't overmix the wet ingredients that will make your crust rubbery.
4855	616	It turned out great! I added 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla. I  mixed the dry ingredients separately from the wet ingredients then stirred them together just until combined to keep the bread from being tough.
4856	616	I used the Splenda brown sugar baking blend instead of regular white sugar, and added a splash of vanilla extract. It came out delicious, with way less carbs and essentially no fat. My 8 year old even begged me to make it again the next day!
4857	616	This recipe is amazing as-is!! I was overwhelmed with all the adjustments people made in the reviews so I just trusted the recipe and it was delicious.
4858	616	Since my bananas were very ripe, I omitted the sugar entirely. I also only used one whole egg rather than two egg whites. I used my baked donut pan to make 12 baked items. These are great popped into the toaster on a low setting to get them warm for a breakfast item with my coffee in the morning. Even with the addition of a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate chips to the recipe, the calorie content for each donut is 106.
4859	616	The best banana bread!!!  We loved it and so did our (socially distanced) friends!  I doubled everything, used two whole eggs instead of egg whites, and added walnuts, sunflower seeds, and sugar-free chocolate chips. I also used a mixture of 50/50 brown sugar and Splenda.?
4860	616	I made it with the changes people suggested.  I baked it for about 1hr 15 minutes. It's a very moist loaf. I thought 1/2 c sugar was still too sweet.
4965	628	Would have liked thicker consistency. Will use less milk next time. Overall tasted good.
4966	628	Amazing! It's simple and easy, taste amazing!
4861	617	I can confirm this cake is super tasty, moist and the recipe is very easy to make the only thing I will change is to put less sugar as found it too sweet for my liking but apart from that I highly recommend it
4862	617	Agree w/mominml.  Mine does not look like the primary photo.  Not cake like at all.  A dense cookie bar.  Not what I had in mind, but not inedible.  I won't make it again.  Appreciate the suggested changes by others but too much of a hassle to keep track of the tweaks and don't know how to amend the recipe were I to keep it in my collection (which I won't as is).
4863	617	This was an easy to throw together cake that tasted great. I read several of the reviews and made the following changes: baked in a 9 in cake round, 2 large bananas, used baking soda instead of powder, cooked for 25 mins and added a touch of cinnamon. Next time, I think I'll try with the baking powder just to see what the difference is but still a make again recipe.
4864	617	The recipe is great and is definately maulable.I used baking soda instead of powder (about 3/4 of a tsp), and I've made it as a sheet pan cake, a bread loaf and today I made it as muffins, just be sure to adjust baking times and temps as needed. If you're making a loaf, you might need to decrease the temp, and/or bake it longer. I've added nuts on the top too and it makes it taste so wonderful!
4865	617	These are definitely more like thicker bars, than a cake. Based on other reviews, I did increase the sugar to 1 cup and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Topped with cream cheese frosting. They were excellent!
4866	617	Very good, used 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda + 1 tsp of vanilla, 3 bananas.
4867	617	Loved this recipe!! It was easy to follow and it was mouthwatering!! My kitchen smelled Devine!! I made mine in muffin tins though because it makes it easier to give out!! Thanks again!!
4868	617	It was really good. I put some more chocolate in it but it still turned out to be very good.
4869	617	look nice very easy to make
4870	618	I followed the recipe exactly as shown, but substituted honey for the brown sugar. Mine turned out delicious. I baked them for 18 minutes.
4871	618	Loved these muffins!! I used walnuts instead, used cranberries, left out coconut and ginger-might try the ginger next time. These tasted great and will definitely make again/often 😊
4872	618	Taste even better the next day!!!
4873	618	Excellent banana bread base recipe. So my fave bb of all time is Moosewood Cookbook's but their secret ingredient is coffee & my toddler doesn't need that😹Modifications:No zucchini, nuts, dried fruit (yes to coconut tho)3 eggs (I almost always add an extra egg- recommended!)Creamy df milk (instead of yogurt, forgot to buy)Melted butter (instead of oil)Added a little baking powder (they rise nicely!)Forgot to add vanilla, def will for next time!Made some minis and some regular. Baked 10 min then rotated for another 10 min.My kid loves them!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼Will freeze a bunch so he has snacks for the week. Thanks for this gem. 💎Excited to play with this recipe now!
4874	618	I have made this recipe dozens and dozens of times - and (almost) never as listed. But I give it 5 stars because it gives you the structure to make healthy muffins your own way.The modifications I use include:*Substitute almond flour for the wheat flour (anyone who's diabetic will appreciate the lower carbs and increased protein and fiber);*Eliminate the sugar; in many cases, this is simply not necessary - if you put any type of fruit in it at all there is already plenty of sweetness*I use what I have on hand and need to use up. I have found the veg/banana at the beginning is approximately 2 cups of 'wet' ingredients and accounted for that accordingly.*Always keep the wet/dry ingredient ratio no matter what. Always include the salt, baking soda, and eggs in exact proportion.
4875	618	Didn’t use any dried fruit or coconut, instead added dark chocolate chips and fresh raspberries. These muffins are my favourite and they freeze great!
4876	618	I was looking for a recipe that called for wheat flour.  This one is better than I thought it would be.  I change cherry with cranberry.  I will be making this recipe again and again.
4877	618	Super moist!!! Love the flexible ingredients-used what I had available; enjoyed topped w/ cream cheese (Mascarpone) and Nutella.
4878	618	Great recipe that can easily be modified. I cut back on the zuchinni and added crushed pineapple (yum!). Delicious!  Next time I may cut back on the soda and salt as I found they tasted a little salty.  But I don't use much salt, so that may be the reason.
4879	619	Very flavorful & easy to put together. A keeper.
4880	619	Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make and I’m no cook. You don’t need the celery. Also, if the peppers are kind of soft you don’t need to boil them. We like a little bit of crunch in our peppers. I covered mine with shredded mozzarella with about two minutes left to bake. Perfection.
4881	619	This is the best recipe for stuffed peppers. I make it every year. You can double the amount of peppers used because  this recipe makes a lot of stuffing mix. Enjoy!
4882	619	Really amazing! Thank you for sharing the recipe.
4883	619	4 1/2 stars.  I only made 1/2 of the recipe as so many reviewers reported too much filling.  This worked out to fill 8 banana peppers and 1/2 of a large bell pepper which was just right.  There is no need to par boil the peppers, this is in the oven for 60 min. and the peppers are thoroughly cooked during this time.  I made a few changes; reduced the amount of bread crumbs by 1/2 and because I was afraid of them being too hot, I used mild sausage which was just right for us (and we love hot/spicy food).  Also used tomatoes from my garden for the "crushed", and tomato sauce for the paste.  It worked out nicely.  I plated the peppers on top of orzo pasta.  We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again.
4884	619	I wish I read reviews I also had double the amount of sausage needed.  Now I find myself trying to find something to cook with the 1 pound of extra hot and sweet sausage mixed with egg, bread crumb and cheese
4885	619	I too have made this with slight alterations.  As for the extra  filler, I made them into meatballs and added them to the pan, they turned out just fine.
4886	619	Took me much longer than 30 minutes to put this together, but it was worth it. This recipe is a keeper!
4887	619	This recipe is fantastic but be CAREFUL with adding the salt. I followed the recipe to the letter, adding 2 1/2 tsp salt without tasting to see if it needed it. It turned out that my cheese, sausages and jarred tomato sauce already provided significant salt, so adding more made my peppers CRAZY SALTY. Even so, my husband loved these and immediately wanted me to make the recipe again for lunch for his employees. I left the added salt out completely for the second batch and it was AMAZING.  I used Cubanelle peppers which are larger and sweeter than banana peppers. They worked great. Parboiling was no big deal to me while I prepped the stuffing. I did like how it made the peppers nice and soft and easy to stuff really full.
4888	620	Good starter recipe for muffin top cookies. A good use for blackening bananas too.  I added blueberries. I had to sub some yellow cake mix because I was running low on flour but I just adjusted the sugar. Mine took 15 min in convection mode at 325
4889	620	I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and the only adjustment I made was to add a bit of vanilla some cinnamon and increase the oven temperature to 350°, since I am in a high altitude.  I love that it does not have too much sugar in it and they really taste delicious.
4890	620	I love this recipe! It's quick and easy with minimal mess. And they're delicious too! My 2 year old granddaughter loves them, too.
4891	620	I actually used 3 bananas. The recipe was easy to make with my son and turned out really light and fluffy. I will use this receipe again.
4892	620	This recipe is very easy to make and my family loves theses cookies.  I even used it to make muffins and took so to work. My coworkers enjoyed them. They always asking me to make them for them.❤️
4893	620	LOVE LOVE these!! They are so light and fluffy and soooo easy to make. I made them a few days ago and about to make another batch right now. I made them 1 tablespoon each and they were still quite large. I will make them half the size this time around. Highly recommend!
4894	620	I just made this fluffy cookie for my toddler and I love it 💞 even with just 1 spoon of sugar.Easy to make and delicious!
4895	620	Absolutely delicious and so easy!!  These will be a regular at our house!  Thank you for sharing.
4896	620	Really good. Gave some to neighbors and now they want more! I added some peanut butter for additional taste and a little more protein.
4897	621	I love this recipe, I used plain Greek yogurt and sugar free caramel syrup instead of vanilla yogurt! It’s heavenly!!!Thank you
4898	621	it was quick to make me and my sister and grandmother really enjoyed it !
4899	621	use
4900	621	I did 1 cup of everything instead of 2 i also added honey into my smoothie best smoothie ever!!! Really enjoyed this one
4901	621	Great smoothie, I have been drinking these after workouts, and i have become very fond of them.
4902	621	I used frozen mangos and had to estimate the amount, but it was still delicious!
4903	621	Really tasty, no sugar!
4904	621	Used 1/2 a cup less milk and added 1-1/2 cups of crushed ice.
4905	621	I halved the recipe with one banana, one mango and used half silk vanilla yogurt and no milk. Added ice. It is delicious.
4906	622	I made this smoothie but alternated it a little
4907	622	Delicious!
4908	622	Made exactly as described, but used vanilla protein powder instead of chocolate. Perfect, easy recipe using ingredients I had on hand already.
4909	622	OMG, I love this smoothie! I would make it everyday if I could.
4910	622	It was delicious i added a tablespoon and a half of orange juice to give it some flavor
4911	622	I didn’t have the almonds but the smoothie was amazing! It’s definitely going to become my go-to post-workout smoothie
4912	622	A delightful drink. I add heavy whipping cream to all my smoothies.  It makes them more frothy.
4913	622	All I did to change it was put somebody ice in. Pretty good.
4914	622	No, I did not make any changes. I followed every step, and it came out so delicious! Of course, I will make it again! I will also show all of my friends and family because I am sure they will love this delicious smoothie as much as I do!
4915	345	Terrible! Would not recommend. They look nothing like the picture.
4916	345	Not at ALL like the picture. A food dehydrator may have worked. Mine were black, stuck and not even the texture of gummy worms. Lemon did not make bananas not turn brown.
4917	345	Banana chips can be heated or seared. Anyway heating may take somewhat more time than browning. Conjointly southern style banana chips taste magnificent.
4918	345	The bananas stuck to the parchment paper really bad, and did not come out a golden color like the picture shown. Taste is not great either.
4919	345	i made it , and the chips where crunchy, its just that i was dumb and didn't grease the paper. they stuck and i had to turn them to powder
4920	345	I made these and followed the instructions.  After 90 minutes I took them out to cool thinking they would firm up to be "chips", but they just stayed mushy.  Maybe I needed to bake them longer????
4921	345	Not good. They looked like shriveled mushrooms and smell weird.
4922	345	Yes
4923	345	Recipe was terrible!!!! I started baking at 12:30 and their not done at 3:45 the ones that I cut paper thin aren’t crunchy at all. The middles of the slices are black.
4924	624	I changed substituted the water wth milk, used brown sugar instead of white, and used apples instead of bananas.  I didn't add any salt and put a large knob of butter at the bottom of the bowl and the hot porridge on top.  For a twist you can grate an inch of ginger into it as well.
4925	624	It was better than expected! I thought it would be way too salty, so I just added a bit of brown sugar and it was amazing. I was freaking out that it wouldn’t work without bananas because I realized I didn’t have them, but any fruit works just fine (I used apples). It was warm and ooey-gooey and just altogether delicious! My mom, sister and me ate it gladly. 10/10 would recommend, I’ll be making it again soon!!!
4926	624	This is a nice hot breakfast cereal. I think the bananas would have been better mashed before they were cooked. I thought the recipe called for too much salt, so I used just a dash. I used a whole teaspoon of cinnamon. I added the golden raisins/sultanas as the submitter suggested, and they were a nice addition. I topped with almond milk.
4927	624	Amazing Porridge, but I recommend heating the milk up.
4928	624	Too salty.  I do not recommend this recipe.
4929	624	The porridge was much too salty. I recommend adding just a pinch or none at all. Next time I will not cook the bananas with the porridge but add after cooking.
4930	624	I used brown instead of white sugar and apples instead of bananas for an apple cinnamon flavoured porridge. It turned out pretty well but I have to say this: do NOT put salt in this!!! Nix the salt completely unless you're going for a savoury dish. The salt very nearly RUINED my porridge but I managed to make it palatable by adding heaps more sugar. In short, this recipe should be: 1 part oats to 2.5 parts water plus any flavouring you want. Heat and mix.
4931	624	I made it and it was sooooo good! Instead of white sugar, however, I used stevia. Stevia is not only healthier, but more powerful, so it really gave it the bang it was missing. I'll def make this dish again.
4932	624	Turned out so well! :) thank you for sharing!
4934	625	My go to banana bread recipe! Taste amazing and it’s also very forgiving/versatile. Depending on how many bananas I have, I just go based on that (3-5 any size) and it comes out fine. I also add pinch of nutmeg and use dark brown sugar instead of light for a deeper flavour. I do find with my oven it may take longer than the required time though, so I make muffins instead for a shorter bake (17-20 min).
4935	625	I loved it, in fact the grandchildren loved it, and one is always suspicious of food! Ha!  I did have to go almost an hour though, but I made mine in silicone pans so that may be why.  Mine was quite a bit darker than this photo, and I made 2,  but only required me to go 1-1/2 times the recipe, it was wonderful! Very moist and super flavorful. Will be great toasted in the morning!
4936	625	My family and I absolutely love this banana bread.
4937	625	One of the best banana breads I have made!
4938	625	This made very yummy banana bread. It was especially good heated up. The bread was pretty dense and moist, but very delicious, and the crust was soft and sticky. I would say maybe add some more spices, and maybe even more cinnamon. I think nutmeg might be a good addition. Very yummy, and was popular with my friends. It's good to use overripe bananas, and also I did not do the plastic bag mashing method I just put them in the bowl with all the other stuff and mashed them in there with a fork, and it turned out fine. I didn't want to waste the plastic. This might only work if the bananas are really overripe though. I also do not have an electric mixer, but it worked perfectly fine by hand.
4939	625	Enjoyed making this banana bread with my 11 year old daughter. The house smelled amazing!
4940	625	No changes.  Excellent!
4941	625	The flavor is good, but “4 bananas” leads to a very inconsistent end product!  (Some bananas are nearly twice the size of others.). Also, I have no idea who is able to bake this for only 40 minutes!  At 40 minutes, the center portion of the bread was still visibly sticky!  Even after 50 minutes, the center was still not done but the ends were almost overly done.  I ended up turning the oven down to 250 degrees and leaving it in for 10 MORE minutes. The center was finally done, but the ends were over cooked so they got thrown away. Making muffins out of this recipe worked much better, but I just kept checking them and didn’t write down the total cooking time.  Next time I will just use a different recipe.
4942	626	This cake is wonderful!  We used pecans instead of walnuts.   This is one of the most moist cakes I have ever made.  My family has made this cake for years.
4943	626	Have never made a Hummingbird Cake before! Was a random decision to bake as I had some overripe bananas.I cut the sugar down to 1 cup (used raw sugar instead of white) & the oil also down to 1 cup. Also not sure what black walnuts are or if we can buy them but used "normal" walnuts & worked well.Shared at work & with neighbours today. Everyone loved it!Had to convert a few things to metric but was still a nice easy recipe to follow.
4944	626	I made this cake as written. It is my new go to cake for Autumn. I will make this cake again and change up a few things since it seems to be so versatile with the ingredients! LOVE IT!!
4945	626	My favorite cake is Hummingbird Cake and this recipe I used is the best and now my favorite!
4946	626	yummie
4947	626	The recipe certainly  Looks delicious! I can't make it as is since my son, the professional chef, has a pineapple allergy. Is there something I can use as a substitute? I was thinking canned peaches but they don't have the same texture as pineapple so do not know how they would work out. Maybe get too mushy? Help me make this cake a surprise for him for Thanksgiving! TIA!!?
4948	626	yummy cake!  I changed the white sugar for brown sugar and added a bit more pineapple as I had purchased the 20 oz can.  very, very good.
4949	626	Such a comfort food dessert. Like banana bread in a cake with the best cream cheese icing.
4950	626	First time making this particular cake and it was delicious!! My boss loved it and honestly it tasted better than the one he had gotten from a bakery the week before
4951	627	This is a pretty simple breakfast cookie, and they tasted really nice. But I tried to halve the recipe and I added 3tsp of allulose. So i cheated. And 1/2c of craisins. I only had  one banana and in the end I noticed that I needed more oats so I ended up having to add in another 3/4 c of oats to the 1/2c I had started with. You can tell as you're putting them on the pan that they're going to be in the shape you put them in and not going to rise, so I flattened them into a cookie shape and they came out perfectly shaped. I only gave them four stars because they needed more oats than specified but this is a loose mixture so it's going to look runny even  when it's not.
4952	627	No milk needed.
4953	627	These were really tasty. My 11 and 6 year old loved them. I put half a cup of extra oats and mixed through some seeds & a few chocolate drops. This is a good way of using up any overripe bananas.
4954	627	not my favorite, a little rubbery in texture. Easy to make--try quick oats instead?
4955	627	Ingredient wet to dry amounts are way off. Same as others, using amounts shown did not work. I added another banana, and upped the oats to 2 cups, added 2 TBSP peanut butter powder and it was still soupy, so added almost a cup of organic oat bran, and that finally gave a thicker consistency. Also drizzled a little (1/2 tsp) of maple syrup before baking They are in the oven now - hoping they taste okay!
4956	627	I substituted the milk with almond milk original and used 2 cups of oats. Made 18 cookies. I probably make my cookies a little smaller than most so I Had to watch bake time closely. It was closer to 11-12 minutes.
4957	627	I followed the recipe almost 100%. I added more vanilla (because of clumsiness) and cinnamon (can never have enough spices). They were very sweet, since my bananas were quite old. I freeze my cookies for a quick breakfast when I am late for work.
4958	627	Made this recipe today. I followed a few reviewers advice and increased the salt 1/4 tsp, added 1/2 cup more oats (I blended them into a powder first), 2 TBSP peanut butter and a small amt of dark chocolate chips.  Even with all this they are still so so bland. Not sure what else to do but add sugar (haha) to help these out. Won’t make again.
4959	627	I added organic peanut butter and a tablespoon of protein powder. These are easy fast and very yummy!
4960	628	ok
4961	628	Very easy very nice I added some cinnamon 1 teaspoon of hot chocolate powder and some vanilla tasted nice only thing I didnt like was how it wasn't cold it was like a warm temp but pop in the freezer for a few mins abd it's good too goI think a frozen banana and milk would be colder
4962	628	i liked it, i added one extra banana and i made milk from powedered milk since i didnt have milk but all in all i like it
4963	628	It was fast and delicious , scrumptious and nutritious.
4967	628	I added some vanilla extract and it was super good!
4969	629	Was out of nuts so substituted with chocolate chips but other than that I followed as written. Nice texture and not too sweet (well, except for the chocolate) Next time will use nuts as they're great to add flavour
4970	629	Fiancé and I loved them! I didn’t have any milk so substituted for equal part Greek yogurt (no sugar added, plain, 0%). Came our super fluffy and moist.
4971	629	Love these good fiber as well!!
4972	629	My husband loved these. I did substitute applesauce for the butter and used only 1 egg. I also used 1 c. all-purpose flour, 1/2 c. whole wheat flour and increased the wheat bran to 3/4 c. Added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 c. chocolate chips. I'm going to try the suggestion of adding pumpkin  in place of the bananas.
4973	629	Pretty solid recipe! I've made them twice, first time exactly as listed and second time with a few modifications. Second time I used whole wheat flour with the bran, added a basic autumnal spice mix (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, allspice), some chopped walnuts, and lastly a small sprinkle of mini cinnamon chips on top. Wanted to pump up the fiber content and flavor profile.  Very yummy, and the added wheat flour only made them slightly denser. All the banana helps keep them moist. I think it would work very well with pumpkin instead of banana, too.
4974	629	I didn't have some of the ingrediencies in my larder so I made some changes, still the most fabulous muffins I've ever had.  here are the changes, butter milk instead of milk, Quaker Oats granola instead of bran,  Pecans instead of walnuts.
4975	629	Very good recipe. I made it a couple times. First time I didn't have vanilla, so I supplemented with almond extract, which was good. Second time, I followed recipe as is, but added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Delicious!
4976	629	I used the basic recipe but made a few modifications. I added two additional tablespoons of butter; 1/4 c peanut butter protein, and 1.5 tablespoons of cocoa. They were amazing.  I will definitely keep this recipe.
4977	629	Delicious! Adding this to my favorites for use when bananas go overripe.  Adding 1/2 c dried cranberries next time.
4978	630	I used whole oranges when I blended it up which made it a little pulpy. A little bland but kids begged for more. Good source of fiber.
4979	630	Sooo yummy and tropical
4980	630	ehhh. i made it with a half less of banana because i already knew the banana would be really overpowering. so i finished it, and it tastes like chemicals ! with a slight taste of banana. so i then had to add more strawberries and couple mangoes to make it taste remotely okay… sooo
4981	630	Kids loved it. I thought it was very orange forward but still good.
4982	630	I used frozen blueberries, frozen strawberries, half of a frozen overly ripened banana, and 100% oj. Really delicious. Tons of fiber. I enjoy with a side of walnuts.
4983	630	Good
4984	630	It was good but a little sour.
4985	630	it is delicious
4986	630	I had to add a little bit of water to get it to blend all the way. It tasted good but sugar was missing
4987	631	I changed the flour out for gluten-free oat flour, very moist and light in texture. Best gluten-free banana bread ever. 350' for 68 mins in convection oven.
4988	631	Best banana loaf I have ever tried. Recommend to everyone
4989	631	Absolutely wonderful in every way. So simple my wife was amazed. I used just a little less sugar although some may not want that.I had to take out a little earlier though. Around 55 min not an hour but that's my oven probably. I'm going to try as another person said whole wheat flour and brown sugar next time. Not traditional i realize but what the heck.
4990	631	Great but never ever would I use cooking spray.
4991	631	I added a glaze to the the top raisins and extra cinnamon to my version
4992	631	I load it up. Choc Chips and Raisins
4993	631	This was so amazing and very easy.  Will use this recipe over and over.
4994	631	I was blown away by the lightness of this bread! While it had a heft when I pulled it from the oven, the first bite I took was so incredibly airy. My changes were: whole wheat flour instead of AP, brown sugar instead of white, and some vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Absolutely delicious and a perfect accompaniment to teatime!
4995	631	I made this today, came out perfect. Thanks for recipe!!!
4996	632	Chilled pudding and folded whipped heavy whipping cream to cool pudding then finished receipe as written.  Best Banana pudding ever.
4997	632	I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk, my husband said it was absolutely delicious.
4998	632	Delicious, perfect spring dish , just made 1 little  change, instead of vanilla wafers, I added hazelnut wafers.
4999	632	I liked it a lot but it was a little too sweet fo r my taste.
5000	632	Once again, CJ's recipes help the novice learn! I can make pudding & meringue now...who knew? But this pie was delicious - seriously good.
5001	632	You know there are ALWAYS bananas that get too ripe. And sooner or later you have to either toss them or use them for something. Usually that is banana bread or some variation of banana bread. No more! I had three "over ripe" bananas, perfect for this recipe. I had to go buy some vanilla wafers (a favorite cookie around here), but other than that everything was here.
5002	632	It's a pandemic, so I didn't have vanilla wafers this Christmas morning. I did have phyllo dough though. I pre baked about 10 buttered layers in Pyrex dish and doubled recipe. Yummy, I like it chilled.
5003	632	This was the first Chef John recipe that we tried that didn't work. The meringue fell flat and the consistency of the pudding was mushy. We followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed with the end product.
5004	632	I was concerned when assembling that there wasnt enough custard as written. I used a glass pie dish and did everything as written omitting the liquer cause that isnt something I have on hand. After being in the fridge 4-5 hours I finally got to cut it open. The custard ratio worked out great. Not saying more wouldnt have been a little better but as written it works. My wife made yummy noises when she ate it. Actual yummy noises! This was my 3yo daughter’s first banana pudding and sadly, I think this will have ruined her for any simpler version. Thats OK though cause this pudding rocks!
5005	633	Great recipe.  I use two frozen bananas instead of ice and add a little more milk to compensate for less liquid.  I use the smoothie setting on my Vitamix.
5006	633	My husband and I enjoyed this. It satisfied our craving for ice cream!
5007	633	I edited a little bit to fit what I had in my pantry, but it still tasted very good.
5008	633	this is really good
5365	680	I followed the recipe exact, except I used distilled white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar because that was all I had and it was still delicious.
5009	633	The smoothie was very good and I plan to make it again.  I used almond milk and also added a scoop of protein powder.  I would like for it to be a little bit thicker so I will try to use less milk next time.
5010	633	The taste of the peanut butter and the sweetness of the bananas gave it the right amount of sweetness.
5011	633	I just made this and it's delicious and easy to make.  Low in calories too.  This will now be my go to snack.
5012	633	It’s good
5013	633	I added a bit of chocolate syrup so it tasted more chocolately. My family really liked it though.
5014	634	Super easy to make and very Delicious. I added toffee chips to it. Very good
5015	634	Didn't make any changes . It was DECELICIOUS ! I like this recipe cause it was very simple and used everyday ingredients which i had on hand !
5016	634	I had only 2 eggs, but had lots of overripe bananas, so I thought I’d give this one a try and I’m glad I did! It was a nice, most bread that wasn’t overly sweet. I shared it with my neighbors and they enjoyed it as well. The cooking time was 20 minutes more for me and I used the loaf pan size in the recipe. I would recommend this recipe!
5017	634	Super easy and fast to put together.
5018	634	I loved how this came out! So did my kids and hubby!
5019	634	I doubled recipe did 2 cups oats 2 cups flour for more fiber and less heaviness. Also use a dash of vanilla cinnamon and chunks of candied ginger
5020	634	A simple and easy to follow recipe. I had two bananas that were just about to get tossed, so it was simple for me to adjust this recipe.
5021	634	doesn't rise and very heavy but if eaten while warm its delish
5022	634	Very tasty, I just added some chia seed to the top , very nice
5023	635	Delicious treat I added a few drops of vanilla extract an a pinch of salt to take it up a knotch....yummy!
5024	635	This Overnight Breakfast Idea that make for a Bright Start to the Day is  wonderful, healthy, tasty easy, and can be modified.  I have made a similar recipe many times and like other reviews I prepared several at a time and kept them in the refrigerator for a quick and satisfying breakfast.  Also, for a change have switched the fruit or added either nuts or coconut instead of chia seeds, used regular milk instead of almond milk and garnished with toasted slivered almond or whatever I had on hand and always turned out just as good.  This recipe is very forgiving and fabulous!
5025	635	Yummy! I added more bananas.  Will try with coconut mil in future and use nuts too.
5026	635	Chocolate
5027	635	I found the quantity of milk was a little less than needed. Still stays chewy. Overall I liked the recipe but was a bit disappointed with the texture. It was a little better with a little more milk.
5028	635	I added strawberries and blueberries as well
5029	635	Was so easy and quick   next day
5030	635	I make with any fruit I have on hand.  We like to heat the mixture from the jar to a bowl in the microwave for breakfast.  It is very nourishing and good.
5031	635	This is a great weekday breakfast. I make several at a time and keep them in the refrigerator for a quick and satisfying breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. The only modification was that I added 1/4 cup of raisins to each jar. This is a game changer. The raisins rehydrate and become plump and juicy, with a nice crispness to them, like when you bite into a fresh grape. Definitely one of my favorite new items to make.
5032	636	I baked these twice in the last 2 weeks. So good. I add baking powder so it s more like a cake.  Delicious, moist and perfect !
5033	636	So delicious..I doubled the recipe and not sure where I went wrong as it came out crumbly!! The taste is phenomenal!!
5034	636	the first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly as written. it tasted more banana bread than brownie VERY light chocolate flavor 2-3 stars. I tried  the recipe again  but with a full cup of Chocolate Chips and a 1/4 C of cocoa powder and it was AMAMZING!!!
5035	636	The flavor of the brownies was tasty.  The texture was much drier than I expected.  I will try it again with a second egg.
5036	636	Love it!!!   Easy to make!
5037	636	Fudgy consistency, but tbh the banana made it a little weird. Would prefer a basic brownie I think.
5038	636	My 7yo son loved it. The directions were very easy even for someone who has not much experience in the kitchen like me. The first time I’ve made it, I didn’t have proper baking materials so I used a disposable aluminum tray. The turn out was perfect. But the second time, I used an 8” loaf pan and baked it for 30 minutes for 325 degrees as instructed but it was undone in the middle. I baked for another 10 and came out fudgy but was still very good.
5039	636	I had 2 bananas to use up so I added a second egg as well. Baked in a glass 11X7" dish.  Increased baking time to 35 minutes. The result was fudgy and moist. Definitely will make again.
5040	636	Amazing! My kids loved them and they were soooo easy to make. Will definitely make again
5041	637	The best and super easy
5042	637	I replace butter with vegetable oil and use brown sugar and add cinnamon.  It's good but next time I will try with butter. It's super easy I like it.
5043	637	So easy and effortless.
5044	637	Its the best ever tasted. No longer make banana bread anymore. Always make a diubke batch because it doesn't last very long.
5045	637	I added walnuts and chocolate chips
5046	637	Added chocolate chips and 2 extra bananas.
5047	637	Fantastic recipe, I adjusted the sugar to 1/3 instead of a cup. Super delicious and moist!
5048	637	I added 1/4 cup of coconut rum and 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips to this and it turned out delicious!
5049	637	It is a beautiful recipe. I added a streusel topping. I also added walnuts and made it sugar free substituting Stevia.
5050	638	No changes and it was perfect! My whole family loved it. (Even the ones that don't eat sour cream loved it!
5051	638	I added a little orange zest to the cream cheese. Delicious! I can see tweaking the recipe for the seasons. Warm spices and nuts in the fall. Almond extract and almond butter in spring. Love the silky, Custard like texture of this bread .
5052	638	Meh.  Made recipe as printed except added cinnamon.  Not worth the trouble.  Cream cheese mixture was basically tasteless.  Will stick to my grandmother's banana nut bread recipe in the future.
5053	638	Was just ok for me. Wouldn’t make it again.  Looked better than it tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was.
5539	704	Loved it! So refreshing and decadent, but healthy, too. :)
5540	704	Best smoothie I've ever made,
5054	638	I tweaked it,Used 2 1/2 bananas,1/2 tsp cinnamonAdded peanut butter chips to the bread and sprinkled on topAdded crushed mazapán Crunch bars to the bread and cream cheese…Used a good amount of butter to grease the glass loaf pan that I have..Baked at 350 for 1 Hr 3 Min (perfection!)Best banana bread ever. Ever!!!
5055	638	I have made this delicious bread twice now. The first time with the cream cheese and OMGoodness it was sooo good! The second time without the cream cheese, and still sooo delicious, moist and melts in your mouth like butter. The only change I made was that I added raisins. My husband loves the raisins in this bread. The whole family loves this recipe.
5056	638	The recipe was easy to follow after baking at 350 for 50 minutes we took out the bread and the top was very wet and raw dough looking. Baked longer...then longer and longer. After 90 mins the edges are very dark but the spots on top still look a little wet we think it might be okay now.
5057	638	The recipe worked great! Moist and delicious. One thing though. The cream cheese filling was runny so it cooked in a more swirl pattern rather than a "filling".  Mine didn't look like the photo. It is still a great recipe and I will make again. (I may have made the filling incorrectly :( )
5058	638	I added nuts.. Can't wait to taste...Looks delicious 😋.
5059	639	Delicious, didn't have apples but it was kiwi soup.I added 3 gelatin packs and it didn't get betterFinally I added 3 corn starch slurries and it thickened as a jam is meant to!
5060	639	This jam has wonderful flavor with the pineapple juice.  It came out perfectly thick as a jam should so I did not have any issues with it being runny.  I used an immersion blender at the end of the cooking time to incorporate the cooked apple halves with skin into the jam and this definitely helped thicken it.  I then let it cook slightly longer partially covered.  This recipe made 6-8 oz/half pint jars of jam.
5061	639	This jam is Delicious!  When you finish boiling the jam, a taste test will seem too sweet.  It quickly mellows once the jam cools.  Using tart apples (Granny Smith or fall Macintosh) will also reduce the sweetness.  Very easy to make, simple to reduce/multiply recipe, & versatile - good on pancakes, cake, toast, & brie. Go make it!  You won't be sorry.
5062	639	I don’t eat kiwi but I made this for my boyfriend and it was phenomenal... it’s got me reconsidering my dislike for kiwi. We will definitely make this again
5063	639	My kids loved making this and the really love the sweet and tangy taste.  I must admit that you have let it boil and stir for a long time but it's worth it.
5064	639	This recipe is great if you interpret it correctly.  For every 3 cups of mashed kiwi you need to add 4 cups of sugar, 1/2 lemon, 3/4 pineapple juice and 3 apples ( I used nine apples for the whole batch, 2 lemons and just one serving of pinapple juice because I was worried it would be runny( but- it's a bit thick) .  Mine made 8 cups of kiwi (so that is how I calculated the recipe). I got three quart jars of jam.  It set up very nice, just like the picture.
5065	639	Delicious! 13 kiwis made just about 3 cups mashed. Added a little pineapple to make up the difference. Used an immersion blender before ladling into jars to blend the apple peels. Not too sweet, just right! I certainly hope to make this one again.
5066	639	I made kiwi jam and sent my dad who lives in the south a jar.  He called and said, honey, this looks like frogs eggs in pond scum.  Now, that's the name of my kiwi jam!  Love it!  MP in Chico.
5067	639	My jam came out perfect.  It was firm and held it's shape when I scooped it out of the jar and I didn't change anything except the temp and how long you cook it. Oh and be sure you use a really firm or tart apple like a Granny Smith, which has more natural pectin. The recipe says to lower heat and "simmer"... don't do this!  Heat it to a roiling boil and let it cook at that high temperature, stirring frequently until done... It was delicious!
5068	640	Creamy and delicious. Was concerned the apple would take away from the smoothness of the smoothie but with the Bananas, kiwi and plant milk this drink was on point. Refreshing and filling. Added a handful of spinach and a few dollops of homemade plain yogurt. Sliced and froze the banana and some of the plant milk (in silicone icecube tray) the night before making the smoothie. Great base recipe for a refreshing smoothie.
5069	640	It was great! I used more ice, however. One of my favorite smoothies for sure! I'll definitely make it again.
5070	640	if you don have maca powder i substituted it with cacao powder it was great ! :)
5071	640	I found it tasted better when you substituted a couple  cups  of strawberry's instead of kiwi's
5072	640	I hate kiwi but loved this.
5073	640	I sure liked this. Fresh and not too sweet. I used almond milk in place of cow's milk. The maca powder gives it a butterscotch sort of flavour, different and nice but being new to maca powder I only used 1/2 tsp and thought it was fine this way. Thank you Krissu for sharing this recipe.
5074	641	I've made this several times and with many different fruit combinations.  For me it's a no-fail recipe and always is so good.  My family, ranging from 9 to 72, all love it.  Thanks for the great recipe!
5075	641	Winter time is a challenge to find nice tasting fresh fruit.  I used canned mandarin oranges and canned pineapple,  cherry pie filling and fresh blueberries.  It all tastes great!
5076	641	I will make this again, it was very fresh!
5077	641	excited to post my photo of this recipe before even tasting it because it's so easy, and easy to make beautiful. I added almond extract instead of vanilla; I imagine orange extract and/or peel would also compliment these flavors.  Instead of water in the preserves, I used the light syrup drained from the mandarin oranges.

5079	641	Wonderful and tasty.  Had this for guests and they all loved it!
5080	641	This made a great impression! So easy. I debated rolling the dough out or cutting it into cookies and then laying it in the pizza pan. Cutting the cookies was the way to go. Easier to press the dough together and be sure it will cover the pan evenly. Also pack as much fruit as you can to make it pretty and fruity. I could’ve put more fruit on it and it would’ve looked a bit better. I only had a 14” pizza pan so I added another 4 oz of cream cheese a dash more sugar and vanilla. It looks like you slaved but it’s so easy!
5081	641	Pretty yummy. I added a splash of heavy cream (whipped cream would work) to the topping to lighten it up.
5082	641	Awesome!  Will definitley be making this again!
5083	642	We are not big fans of the almond flavor so used Lemon extract instead. Also left off the glaze. Perfect!
5084	642	I made this with gluten free flour and instead of cutting the butter in I melted it. ( was able to use 3/4 cup butter instead of 1cup). Also I found there was way too much glaze so could have cut it almost in half. I didn’t have pineapple juice so just used orange juice. This is a keeper.
5085	642	I made 1 & 1/2 the dough crust in order to fit across the whole stoneware rectangle pan.  Then I also doubled the cream cheese mixture to have enough to spread.
5086	642	The cookie portion needs more sugar as does the cream portion. It was an OK recipe but we'll be altering the recipe to taste more like a traditional fruit tart. The topping was a the best part and allowed the fruit to maintain color.
5087	642	My nephews  love it
5088	642	I make this every year.  shortcut..use pillsbury sugar cookie dough
5089	642	I used leftover cookie dough from my cut-out sugar cookies - worked great!
5090	642	Great recipe and easy to make! I didn't have kiwi so I substituted green grapes (cut in half). I used apple juice instead of pineapple juice.
5091	642	I used the sugar cookie dough crust, no glaze and everyone loved it!!
5092	643	This was the second time making this. It’s delicious! Easy!
5093	643	I’ve made this numerous times and it’s always a favourite!!! I’ve made this exact recipe and other times I’ve substituted some ingredients.To make it lighter, I use plain Greek yogurt to replace the mascarpone. Also, I prefer to use brown sugar but I will only use half of the recommended amount.
5094	643	This recipe was great! I loved the crunch combined with the sweet fruit and tangy filling. I changed a couple things since i didn't have mascarpone or a tart pan. Instead of mascarpone i used a great lemon yogurt i had on hand, added about a tablespoon of lemon rind to boost the flavor of the yogurt, left out the spices and halved the amount of sugar. Since i didn't have a tart pan, i just used a 10" silicone cake pan, and that worked just fine. It was a huge hit at our family BBQ!
5095	643	I cut the filling sugar by half but this is one of my families favorite desserts. Kids request it as their “birthday cake” And it’s easy to make! Tastes best the next day. I usually don’t bother making a glaze since we eat it all in a couple days.
5096	643	Freakin’ awesome! Didn’t use all the glaze, so next time will only make half
5097	643	I made this and turned out great. Very quick and easy to make. I already had mini tartlet pie shells. The only change is I added for the filling is I added less sugar, some fresh lemon juice, and omitted the the nutmeg.
5098	643	I made this and turned out great. Very quick and easy to make. I already had mini tartlet pie shells. The only change is I added for the filling is I added less sugar, some fresh lemon juice, and omitted the the nutmeg.
5099	643	Very delicious. Great recipe
5100	643	Holy guacamole(nice little food pun there) if this isnt the gosh darndest most delectable fruit tart I ever did make. I highly recommend
5101	644	This was delicious! I cooked the onions separate just because my husband doesn’t like onions. So easy to make. I had all the ingredients on hand except for the poblano pepper and lime. I made these with lettuce, tomato, shredded cheddar cheese, and plain Greek yogurt. I forgot the cilantro, but will use it next time as I’m sure it makes them even better. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour because the flour tortillas bother my stomach.
5102	644	Made these this past weekend.  Yummy.  We ate them all weekend.
5103	644	It came out perfect everytime. Both my wife who doesn't like cilantro and my daughter who won't eat uncooked onions loved the salsa. Amazing!
5104	644	This is a keeper!  I made the tacos as the recipe directed and they were excellent. We are big fans of tacos al pastor and I wasn't sure we'd like these ground pork tacos as much ; yet we really enjoyed them.  They are just different enought and hold their own with a variety of accompaniments. I didn't have kiwis in the house, but I made a tomato salsa that was simple but refreshing.    We're not fans of the creama, so I substituted with a homemade queso fresco and cilantro dip instead.   The important point is that the basic taco filling is a very good one and it is capable of being personalized with the salsas and accompaniments of your choice.
5105	644	This recipe was very good, but there is no way this will feed 6 people.
5106	644	I have no idea why this recipe doesn't have more reviews! I never write reviews, but I feel like I should with this one. I've done this more then 5 times already and it ALWAYS comes out tasting amazing. It's easy, but it does take a few extra steps like when making the salsa and crema, but it's always worth it! One thing though is I prefer the salsa with MANGO instead of kiwi. And I use CUBANELLE peppers instead of poblano. Everything else stays the same. Lastly, I assume the Mexican seasoning is like taco seasoning? So I just use a packet of taco seasoning. Sooooo delicious!
5107	644	Followed the meat  & crema recipe exactly, doubled the salsa and added mango.  We used crumbled queso fresco as a topping, my husband and I also used a dash of Jalapeno/Poblano Choulula on ours.  It's going into our family rotation, and has landed on the list of football party foods.  Total winner here folks.
5108	644	These were so good, will definitely make them again. I added some of the cilantro and extra lime juice to the crema for extra and put some shredded cotija cheese on top.
5109	644	I don't usually do an all-pork taco, but the salsa and lime crema made me want to try this recipe. I followed it with the following exceptions:
5110	645	Great recipe on a hot summer day.  I sprinkled on some feta cheese.
5111	645	This is a terrific salad and so easy. Here are my tweaks. I made this for a salad luncheon the other day and didn’t use kiwi because it didn’t look great at the store. But our fresh local strawberries are in season so I used those, the feta and walnuts generously and made the dressing with homemade raspberry preserves.
5112	645	This is not a low-carb recipe. It's got tons of sugars in it from all the fruit!
5113	645	Very good! Loved it. Used balsamic vinaigrette as the dressing
5114	645	Very easy to pull together.  I did add Dijon mustard as one reviewer suggested and I think it added a new dimension to the dressing.  I also used EVOO.  Very tasty with the salad.
5115	645	I made this for my husband's family who don't eat salads on a regular basis & they really liked it.  Especially the dressing (my addition was 3T of fresh squeezed orange juice to give it a little citrus-y vibe). Then doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough.  Glad for the extra as it was all gone & the salad bowl was empty.  Going to make this anytime someone asks me to bring the greens.
5116	645	Didn't change a thing.  It was wonderful.
5117	645	I made it to bring to a potluck lunch and it was yummy. I will definitely make it again!
5118	645	Made this last night! Hubby loved it as well! Cut portions down to two. Made as directed. Will definitely make again. Will try with pumpkin seeds for family with nut allergies.
5119	646	This was really good! The amount of ingredients would have made way too much for just my daughter and I so I just eyeballed the amounts for a smaller smoothie and it tasted great. I didn't have the almond milk with honey so I used regular almond milk and added some honey. Really delicious and even my 5 year old daughter drank every drop!
5120	646	Skipped the milk, added lemon juice, cucumbers, aloe vera and freshly grated ginger
5121	646	I didn't measure they way they did but I followed most of the ingredients. Swapped kale for spinach, added oats for my own health and honey.
5122	646	Tastes great. Would not use this for anything more than a dessert. WAY TOO MUCH sugar.
5123	646	No and yes
5124	646	I made my first smoothie with this recipe..the kiwi taste is very nice, I wasn't able to find the almond milk with honey, so used regular almond instead..it was tasty
5125	646	I use spinach, frozen tropical fruit, squirt of honey. Bariatric Fusion Protein powder, Chai seeds and collagen powder and blended  with Non sweetened Vanilla almond milk. This is my go to daily breakfast since I had bariatric surgery in 2017..don't like kale because its bitter tasting to me
5126	646	Good Health Drink! Instead Of Frozen Fruits, I Prefer Using Fresh Stuff. I Used Fresh Pineapple, Available In My Local Indian Market All Year! All The Items In This Recipe Are My Favorites! Thanks For Sharing!
5127	647	Really tasty and a fun experience!
5128	648	Yummy
5129	648	Loved these indeed!  The right amount of fruit and coconut made for a wonderful frozen delight. I only got three popsicles though...I wonder if me drinking half of the mixture as a smoothie had something to do with it? :-) Make a double batch of these otherwise you'll be writing a review of a wonderful smoothie. Delicious frozen and just as is! Thank you MsNingyoo for this perfectly calculated recipe.
5130	648	these are great. very refreshing. I substituted stevia for sugar.
5131	648	I used sweetened vanilla coconut milk and omitted sugar. I also blended the kiwi into the mix instead of having it chunky. As promised, they were light and refreshing, perfect for an ungodly hot summer day.
5132	648	Oh yes, this recipe is a keeper.  We thoroughly enjoyed these creamy ice pops.  The coconut, banana, pineapple, and kiwi are perfectly balanced, with not one dominating, with the flavor leaning toward a pina colada IMO.  I used light coconut milk and sub'd Truvia for the sugar.  Another thing you'll like about this recipe is how easy it is to make.  These would be the absolutely perfect snack or dessert for a summer BBQ (actually perfect any time in this house!).  Well done MsNingyoo.
5133	649	thought it would be spicier.. next time I will use s bit more kiwi and lime juice..
5134	649	It was very easy and had a wonderful taste.  I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and reduce the amount of salt from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons and I'm very glad I did.  I think it would have been way to salty with 2 tablespoons of salt.  I also reduced the amount of chili powder by half because I'm not fond of it.  So those modifications made it perfect for my tastes.  I will definitely make again.
5135	649	Well I had to make some substitutes but it was fantastic. The first one was instead of the three pounds of ribs I used 1.5 pounds of left over rib meat. The next was I didn’t have chili powder so I subbed in Chinese Five spice. If you have never used it you need to buy it. Lastly instead of minced garlic I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. It turned out amazing and with some mashed potatoes it is defiantly an easy dinner while using leftovers.
5136	649	This was different, but in a good way. An unexpected flavor combination on pork, but it works!
5137	649	I heeded the comments from others about the amount salt and cut it back dramatically. Also, I highly recommend lining the baking dish as once baked, the sauce becomes hardened in the pan. But the flavor is delicious!
5138	649	This recipe was delicious.   My husband is not a big fan of barbecue ribs and this is a great recipe alternative for something different.   The only change I made was the salt.  I used 2 teaspoons.  Great flavor combinations with the chili powder, limes, and kiwi.  I will definitely share this recipe.
5139	649	I don't eat pork but this sauce goes GREAT with chicken. Like others, I halved the salt and used 3 kiwis instead of two, and brown sugar. Yummmm....
5140	649	I thought this was a really good dish.  I used 3 Kiwis and cut down the salt and chili powder as others suggested.  I also used honey instead of white sugar and it was really good.
5141	649	Thanks for posting this recipe!  Note that the sauce is very forgiving.  On short notice I used peaches instead of kiwis and lemon juice instead of lime, and still got rave reviews from the family.  Also used cayenne to make up for a slight deficiency in the chili powder. Next time I'll go with the lime juice and, as others have said, halve the salt.  I think pitted cherries or apricots would also work instead of kiwis.  Would appreciate any hints on reducing the sugar, perhaps substituting Splenda, to make it more diabetic friendly.
5142	650	Excellent and filling! But I think liquid was not put on the list of ingredients. Lack of liquid isn't good for the juicer and makes the smoothie/juice easier to drink.
5143	650	It was okay, I might make it again if we have leftover food and need to use it up, but it wouldn't be my top choice.
5144	650	This is absolutely delicious!
5145	650	This one is pretty good. I added coconut water so that it would blend and it ended up being a good addition. I would make this one again.
5146	650	It was great and great choice of using the carrot! Also thanks to the comments for saying to add water otherwise it would have probably been a chunky mess. One tip is maybe find some more sweeter fruits or use honey to give it more of a sweet taste to satisfy the sweet tooth. Best of luck to whoever makes it next!
5147	650	Too thick and the flavor was a bit too sour with the kiwi and pineapple.
5148	650	Good stuff. Didn't have any pineapples, so I added 1/2 C of OJ, as well as 6 oz of plain yogurt. I liked it enough and so did my 2 yo. I great way to get him to get the benefits of vegetables...so that's good enough for me!
5149	650	A smoothie with a carrot?  Wasn't sure I was going to like that, but I did.  The flavors blended well together and it made for a nice filling breakfast.  I would have liked it a little more on the tart side, but that aside, a good drink.
5150	650	The smoothie was terrible. We used all the ingredients listed, We spent about 30 min. Chopping all the fruits and veggies. We were really disappointed on how it all  came out. To make it taste a little bit better we added 2 tbsp. and it tasted much better. All in all it was not the best.
5152	651	Like the other reviews noted, this does turn out watery. I remedied that by placing the salsa into a colander lined with paper towels for about 20 minutes, and it was perfect. Since the other reviews noted that this is super spicy, I cut the cayenne and habanero sauce both in half, and it was still plenty spicy. I also added a teaspoon of salt, and I think it needs a little more of a zesty lime flavor - like maybe some grated lime peel or something along the lines of the lime chips.
5153	651	I really wasnt sure about the spicy mixed with fruit but it was incredible. I am going to use it with a chicken dish next.
5154	651	Wonderful! I have used mango jam and pepper jelly and both turned out so very tasty. A few small preference changes. I used apricots instead of Kiwi to please my husband and I used fuji apples because I read somewhere they dont brown as easy. I also chose to use honey instead of sugar once and it was great. I paired this with homemade cinnamon tortilla chips. It makes a great pic nic item. Yum!
5155	651	I made this for a 4th of July party. Instead of the black berries I used blueberries. Not only did it make the recipe red white and blue, they were alot cheaper than the blackberries because they were in season. I only used 1 and 1/4 tablespoons of habenero sauce, and only 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. It had just the right amount of kick. I can't imagine how hot it would be if made it as it is called for. Sweet, spicy, and refreshing for a hot summer day!
5156	651	A fresh and fruity alternative to regular salsa for eating with tortilla chips.  After reading the other reviews I started with only half the cayenne and hot sauce, and then added a bit more to my taste.  I used Golden Delicious and Macintosh apples, and red salsa since that's what I had on hand and it was still yummy.  Definitely allow more time than 15 min. for all the chopping!
5157	651	Ohhh it burns so good!  I found this recipe a few years ago, and my family has been begging for me to make it again. It's yummy. Don't think of it as chunky salsa. Think of it as a sauce with spicy sweetness, that puts a twist on the style of salsa.
5158	651	Quite an unusual salsa and spicy enough even when only using half of the hot sauce and cayenne pepper.  Delicious served with lime tostido chips.  I did not add all the "liquid ingredients" (jelly, green salsa, hot sauce) to avoid the salsa being "too runny". Chopping and assembling ingredients take way longer than 15 minutes prep time and served way more than 12.  I ended up freezing half.  Would I make it again~~YES!  It is yummy!  :)
5159	651	LOVED THE SPICY SWEET TASTE.  I ALSO CUT BACK THE HOT SAUCE, BUT LEFT ALOT OF BITE STILL TO THE RECIPE.  GOT RAVE REVIEWS FROM FRIENDS AND COWORKERS.
5160	652	Absolutely delish!! I loved it!!
5161	652	I made it exactly as instructed by ingredients but I didn’t use a springform pan I just traced a circle on parchment paper and formed my meringue by using a spatula to build up the wall edge.  The shape held up perfectly while baking and it was a huge success.  I used ganache to add a little drippings down the side and a little more on the berries. It was very beautiful, I’ll attach a picture.
5162	652	Couldn't find my mother's Pavlova recipe so I tried this one. Don't tell my mother, but I prefer this recipe. The center is beautifully soft like a lemon meringue while the outside is firm and chewy. Absolutely delicious!
5163	652	excellent. i put it on parchment paper , traced a 9 inch circle as a guide, instead of a springform  pan.
5164	652	Best recipe ever!
5165	652	Fantastic!   Had dinner party last week including a couple of fussy eaters - this was the one desert that was entirely devoured!  Very easy -my daughter who is not a fruit lover dripped melted chocolate over the whipped cream and we put a bowl of berries on the side for those so inclined- making this again right now for a friends party!
5166	652	Perfect every time.
5167	652	Yum. That's all I can say about this easy, elegant and tasty desert. Works great with a big dollop of cream and tons of fresh raspberries.
5168	652	This tasted too "eggy" for us.
5169	653	Yummy!!
5170	653	This sangria is very light, refreshing and delicious.  I especially like that, unlike many other sangria recipes, it doesn''t include brandy, which in my opinion weights it down and takes away from the lovely fruitiness.  But that is our personal preference.  A very versatile and adaptable recipe.
5171	653	instead of diluting your drink with ice cubes....i froze the green grapes and used them.  this is an easy and awesome summer time drink and refreshing.
5172	653	Fantastic!!! Easy to make..taste good..we liked this;-)
5173	653	Adding 1/2 cup of brandy scant 3 tablespoons, but I also added the 3 tablespoons of Grand Marnier.
5174	653	I liked this, but was looking for a little more of the orange liqueur flavor, so I did bump up the Gran Marnier a little.  I really prefer the more traditional white sangria with brandy (but that's just a personal taste preference).  Realized after taking the photo that I forgot to add the pear, but I added it later along with a few blueberries.  This made it even more of a refreshing summer drink with a fruit salad on the bottom :-)     Thanks Monica Joy for a nice summer drink for a BBQ.
5175	654	This was good recipe but when I was making it we couldn’t find the correct puff pastry and so we made it with puff pastry sheets. It came out good anyway. It was sweet and tart and the whipped cream added extra flavor and it was very nice alltogether.
5176	654	Delicious! my only suggestion would be that when you blenderize the kiwis with honey, puree the kiwis first, THEN put the honey in.  i put the honey in first, and it all sunk to the bottom of the processor.
5177	654	I used the recipe for the idea and took of with my own version. I used puffed pastry in the Pampered Chef tart pan, omitted the Kiwi and Honey part.  Then used a tub of  Fat Free cool whip with 1/2 tsp cinnamon for the topping.    I got rave reviews but I will try again.
5178	654	Good solid dessert.  I didn't think the kiwi/honey combo was as good as plain kiwi would have been.  Also a little messy/tough to eat.  Overall the taste was good. I added a bit more sugar to the whip cream and doubled the amount of whip cream suggested in order to have enough whip cream for all six that I made.  In short, good, but I'll probably try a few other strawberry desserts before returning to this one.
5179	654	These were great and really easy to make.  I did everything according to the recipe, but the kiwis at our local market looked really bad, so I used mangoes instead.  I brought them to a get together and they were gone right off!  Thanks for sharing!
5180	654	These were very good and my family thought that I bought them at the store!  Maybe I should be offended...anyway, they turned out great!
5181	654	This was a fantastic snack! It was easy to make and it tasted wonderful! Except how do you take the seeds out of the kiwis? I just cut them out in a way! Then again it was very good and I plan on making it again sometime!
5182	654	I didn't take the seeds out of the kiwis... how do you even do that?  Being new to puff pastry, I didn't let it rise enough so it was doughy and not big enough to fit all of the strawberry filling.  All in all, it was a good recipe and I might try it again.
5183	654	Wow! I made these tartlets for my foods class and they were awesome. The glaze on the shells was amazing. They were a tad messy when eating but so worth it!
5184	655	I loved the flavours in the salsa mix!  I did not use the rice as a bed, only the salsa for the tilapia bed.  It was absolutely delicious with all the different flavours!
5185	655	Variation on a theme — used homemade market fresh pineapple base mango salsa, coated fish in spices and cornmeal prior to frying — super delicious
5186	655	Made this following recipe to a tee. No one wanted to eat it. too much vinegar and fish tasted flavorless.
5187	655	I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the fish before pan-frying. None of my family likes the tomatoes in what we called the "fruit salad." So they will be left off the next time.
5188	655	i loved it it was really good but i wanted the salsa to be really HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
5189	655	This was pretty good. With all the lovely fresh veggies around this was a great way getting hubby to eat fish (that isn't fried) because he loves pineapplel and mango.   The fish was pretty plain so I added some smoked paprika before I grilled it.  As for the salsa - I liked the balsamic in the salsa - hubby did not care for it.  I think he thought it would have a terriyaki flavor with the pineapple and mango.  Thanks for an inspiring recipe.
5190	656	I’ve made this multiple times because family and friends request it! It’s a great recipe with no corn starch, no flour so it can be enjoyed by many who have these allergies.  It’s quite simple as long as you know your soft peaks from your hard ones. My daughter also bakes this now and also for repeat performances.  She arranges the fruit beautifully and elevates this into an art form.
5191	656	Made exactly to recipe and it was delicious and turned out perfectly. We have made this many times.
5192	656	I live in the States and have made this a couple of times now for Easter, it makes a beautiful spring dessert. I make it with homemade whipped cream, and no added sugar. I agree the cream should not be sweetened as the combination is perfect: sweet meringue, lovely cream and sweet/tangy fruit. I use a combination of berries, kiwi and mango. My whole family loves this. We had not tried this dessert before I found this recipe but now it's a favorite! (I skip the coconut and almond due to allergies, but I'm sure they would be marvelous additions) Thanks for sharing this, I'm not a huge sweets person but this is in my top 3!
5193	656	I've made this twice for guests and all enjoyed it.  The first time I put it on parchment using a 9" circle, and the second time I used a parchment lined 11" porcelain tart pan.  Both worked fine though the cookie sheet method allowed the meringue to expand  without restriction.  I did sweeten the the whipped cream.  It was delicious!  It's a great make ahead dessert and looks gorgeous.
5194	656	This recipe makes 2 large pavlova! We gobbled up the first one, but didn't have room for the second.  Pretty easy to make,  and looks beautiful.
5195	656	I followed the recipe to the T and it did not turn out right, but it did taste good. My mom hates anything with coconut in it and she realy liked this.
5196	656	Great recipe!  Great texture! New and unique (in the US at least!) It is an easy recipe that puts to use leftover egg whites!  I like to make this after I have made eggnog (recipe from this site) or traditional vanilla pudding (recipe also from this site).  You could make it any flavor I believe.  I add amaretto liquor to mine to make it almond flavor.
5197	656	This was a HIT with my family and friends!!  I made this for a summer treat and quickly found out that I have to make more than just one each time I make it! My kids can eat an entire Pavlova by themselves (a 3 and 6 year old)!  We love this recipe and everyone in the family now has a copy of it!  Thanks for sharing :)
5198	656	Not bad, I am an Aussie that lives in the US.  Pavlova is probably my favorite dessert. I think my Mom makes one of the best Pav's around.  I LOVE passionfruit and it is the real/traditional topping for Pavlova.  Passionfruit makes this dessert, it is not the same without it; in fact it would just be a meringue topped with fruit.  I LOVE PASSIONFRUIT, and that's how REAL Aussie's make it.
5199	657	I added a bit more honey and lemon zest for more tang!
5200	657	This was delicious! I used lemon juice instead of lemon zest and did not refrigerate over night, but it turned out great. This is one of my new favorites for a quick, tasty breakfast.
5201	657	Wow! Very good. What a unique way to eat a kiwi! I just had to try this as I had one kiwi left and all the other ingredients on hand.  I just eyeballed every thing and didn't bother to let the ingredients "develop" for a day. Who can wait that long? I could only wait long enough to lightly toast my bread.....
5202	657	My kids thought this was great. They've been on this whole kiwi kick for almost two weeks now, so this was a great way to use up more. I didn't chop the kiwi fruit, I just sliced it like I would for a tomato sandwich. I also didn't have time to refrigerate the spread. This was a great way to use up ingredients I always have on hand and clear out the fridge before grocery day. Thanks.
5203	657	I REALLY enjoyed this sandwich! I made it on a whim, so I didn't have time to let the cream cheese mixture refrigerate overnight, but it sure was tasty. I just eye-balled everything to taste, and used dried lemon peel and whipped cream cheese for easier mixing/spreading. I served this on lightly toasted Italian-style sliced bread. This was also a big hit with my little guy. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
5204	657	This was really yummy.  I didn't have any lemons on hand, so I used lemon curd and skipped the honey.  Such a different idea, but one that we loved.
5205	657	I made these for a birthday party and they got mixed reviews.  Some people liked them, but others took one bite and didn't finish it.  Personally I liked the mix of honey and kiwi.
5206	658	Very delicious. This recipe will work with any pork. I will do this recipe wit boneless pork ribs and pork ribeyes
5207	658	I made exactly as the recipe specified with the exception of marinating 24 hours instead of 2 days.  Super delicious recipe.  Great flavor!  This would probably be good seared on the grill at the end instead of broiled as well.
5233	664	I didn't care for the cake-like texture so next time I'll just omit an egg. Love the multigrain cheerio idea though. I may try the peanut butter ones next time also.
5234	664	Didn't care for texture of dough, plus lacked in flavour.
5235	664	I was seriously disappointed with this recipe. They may be healthier, but for me it definitely took a toll on the taste.
5208	659	Hard to believe it's 97 degrees F on the back porch this early in May.  I'm ready for something to cool me down, and this did the trick.  I was expecting something a bit "fruitier" tasting, so next time I'll just eliminate the water; as the ice melts, diluting the fruit flavor will happen naturally.  Hubs thought it was a little tart, so I'll try cutting the lemon juice in half next time (admittedly, all of this is personal taste preference).  This was very refreshing, and you don't need to worry about calories and fat (which is often the case with smoothies), so you can sip without guilt!  GoodCook, thanks for a great afternoon snack!
5209	660	Really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I would make a few adjustments.  First of all, 3/4 cup butter is waaaay too much!  I would cut down to about 1/4 cup; do 1/2 water & 1/2 lemon juice in the Jell-o; omit kiwi and add more mango (Kiwi reacts funny in Jell-o and it was a little runny); and I think it would be good even with a pineapple Jell-o and maybe some coconut in the crust even!
5210	660	Still one of my favorite recipes to make.  In high demand in my household, regardless of the season. I still can’t get the kiwi right, but that’s me, not the recipe
5211	660	Weirdly good.  It was a lot of work for a novelty salad, but everyone enjoyed it, I had no leftovers, and several folks asked for the recipe.  Maybe it just seemed like a lot of work, after all.  The flavors were nice and balanced; I'll make this one again.  Thank you for submitting the recipe.
5212	660	I really enjoyed this! It was a lot of work, though. I used a springform pan, so I cut the amounts slightly. I ground pretzels in the food processor (about 1 3/4 c. total). I used 2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp brown sugar, and only 6 Tbsp butter (but probably could've used a full half cup). While the crust baked, I rinsed out the food processor and used it to blend the cream cheese and sugar, then lemon juice and vanilla. Transferred to a bowl and stirred in the lemon zest. I'm not a fan of Cool-Whip, so I whipped 6 oz of heavy cream and folded it into the cream cheese. Delicious! It was just the right sweetness (even with unsweetened whipped cream), with a great lemon flavor. [I only used 3/4 c cream because I wanted to be sure the filling was firm enough to slice.] While the filling chilled, I BLANCHED THE KIWI. The gelatin won't set otherwise. I peeled and sliced the kiwi, placed slices in a strainer, and lowered it into boiling water. Blanched it for about 45 seconds, transferred the strainer to an ice water bath, and then set kiwi slices aside with the mango. For the gelatin, I used the ice water bath from blanching the kiwi to chill the gelatin mixture until it was ready to pour on the fruit. My verdict? I thought the lemon Jell-O detracted from the rest of the dessert. Next time, I'd play with using fruit juice (mango, or passionfruit) and use 1 pack unsweetened gelatin. Just enough to make a shiny, fruity glaze—not so much for a floating gelatin layer. But I will try this again!
5213	661	I've made Strawberry Salsa many times over the years and also serve with cinnamon chips for dipping. Agree with previous post, I use fresh pineapple so no need for adding white sugar especially if using in season Strawberries. I've found when making ahead, the Kiwi turns a bit pink and "slimy" in appearance. Omit the Kiwi if you're making the previous day. Fresh Mango is a great addition.
5214	661	Breakfast today was this salsa served with cinnamon-sugar baked tortilla chips.  If you need a recipe for the tortilla chips, see Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips on this site.  I had fresh pineapple, so I used that instead of canned, and the orange, strawberries, and kiwi were perfectly ripe, so I didn't need the sugar.  Just simple, fresh fruit flavor at its best!
5215	662	I was skeptical about this but it actualy taste good. Im knew to kale I like it, think bits if bacon wiuld taste good in this recpie
5216	662	The taste is very weird. I didn't have fresh ingredients, so used dried basil, regular salt and pepper, squeeze bottle ginger and garlic, olive oil.
5217	662	I didn’t have kiwi so I substituted diced apple instead, and even then it was wonderful! I was looking for something I had in the house that could give more of the tangy flavour of kiwi, so I sprinkled some with craisens. Both ways were delicious! But now I want to buy kiwi and try it again - can’t wait!
5218	662	It's delicious and unique. I put it in the fridge and eat it cold. I like how the kiwi with the coconut oil makes its own dressing. I use red kale because I don't like larcinato.
5219	662	This was very nice. I added a small number of blackberries that needed to be used up& tried lo-cal bacon crumbles on it. Both worked well. It took longer than 5minutes for the kale to be as wilted as I desired but it was still a quick dish to make.
5220	662	Man, this was good.
5221	662	wow, this was surprising. I really didn't think it would be good at all but I'm glad I tried it because I never would have thought of this combo and it's awesome! a nice alternative to the standard vinegar and soy sauce style of preparing kale. I could also see this working well with citrus like grapefruit instead of kiwi. lots of potential here.
5222	662	Yummy! I love the flavor combo of these powerhouse foods together. The only thing I did different was to use KerryGold grass fed butter instead of coconut oil because I was out. The tanginess of the kiwi really complimented the ginger and garlic. This one is a winner.
5223	662	This recipe looked so interesting I just had to try it.  I doubled the ingredients (for four servings) and made it as written except for using curly kale and substituted 1 tbsp dried oregano for the fresh. Sorry, but nobody in my family including myself cared for it. The oregano was especially overpowering, and the kiwi tasted like very sour lemon. If I ever make this again I think I'd cut the oregano way down and use only half (or less) of the kiwi called for.
5224	663	YUM!!! No changes necessary.
5225	663	I used bananas, strawberries, raspberries, pineapple, coconut cream and mango juice. Made a wonderful midday snack.
5226	663	I think I am the only one that made this smoothie and realized there was no liquid in the recipe! I made 1/2 recipe as the calories were rather high for 1 serving. Most of my fruit was frozen, so that may have been partially the problem. However, I never saw a smoothie without any liquid. For 1/2 the recipe I added 1 cup of almond milk. Besides that, the flavor was pretty good. ty
5227	663	I had a frozen banana that I used in this smoothie which eliminated the need for ice. I also do not keep cream of coconut on hand but I did have some fat free evaporated milk--I used that and a half teaspoon of coconut extract. Very tasty smoothie. I'm glad that it didn't call for additional sugar because it was plenty sweet on it's own. Has a "tropical" feel to it. I liked this smoothie a lot.
5228	663	i liked it but i made it without coconut
5229	663	Absolutely delicious!
5230	663	I loved this smoothie - but you need to like coconut to enjoy it.  The kiwi added just the right amount of tartness to this drink.  Made it for my breakfast and it hit the spot.  Thanks for sharing.
5231	663	delicious!
5232	663	delicious!
5236	664	WOW!!!! these are the best cookies ever!!! my husband and daughters loved them so much. I like the fact that I can used my old cheerios cereal and kiwi!!! I am guessing you could use any other fruit to make them. I KEEPER!
5237	664	Love this recipe, these cookies disappeared in a blink of an eye. Trying it with sound other mix ins, and fully expecting it to be equally fantastic.
5238	664	I to randomly had all the ingredients, i used rolled oats and mine were just a hair on the dry side. But supper easy. I love the kind of recipes that you just mix it all together and bake. They were devoured at my house dry or not.  And my 4 yr old just loved helping me make them.
5239	664	The Cheerios and pureed kiwi was an interesting twist so I wanted to give it a try. To be honest I didn't know what to expect after I decided to make this recipe. I happen to have all the ingredients on hand, well I had Peanut Butter Cheerios and Chocolate Cheerios so I went with the Peanut Butter. The cookies didn't brown much when I took them out of the oven. I allowed them to cool and tasted and was surprised this is a fantastic cake-like cookie.
5240	665	This is a fun, delicious dessert.   It was a big hit at my dinner party!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
5241	665	Instead of making these "to go," I scaled the recipe to 2 servings as a snack for my preschooler and me. She had trouble getting the cream from the bottom of the cup and in the end had cream leftover. I think there is enough mixture that you could make 2 layers of fruit and cream, and that would help incorporate throughout the cup. These were tasty and fun; thanks for the idea!
5242	665	made this for a womens book group, and it was wonderful!  everyone wanted the recipe.  My only advice is that after a while the cookies can get soggy and it is much better with crisp cookies.  Put them together at the last minute.
5243	665	These were great!  I made as written with the exception of using canned pineapple and frozen bluberries.  It was pretty and delicious.  I will definitely make again.  It's something my kids enjoyed helping with.  I'm looking forward to trying with different fruit combos and also may try almond or amaretto flavor instead of vanilla in the cream cheese.  Thank you "lovestohost"!  It's a keeper!!
5244	665	This was a 4th of July hit!  I followed the directions for the cream cheese layer, but only used blueberries and strawberries to follow the red, white, and blue theme.  FYI, I used a 1/4 cup of blueberries for the bottom layer and two heaping tablespoons of strawberries for the top layer.  I sprinkled some toffee chips on the top too for crunch and flavor.  Like I said, this was a huge hit.  I love not having to bring food back home from a party.  :)
5245	665	Fantastic recipe...dont need to alter anything.  I took this to Parent night at my kids school and these were a major hit!
5246	665	Okay...I just tried this and LOVED it! I ended up using peaches, strawberries and blueberries! And I scaled it down to one serving...just for me! I didn't have any sugar cookies, so I used strawberry Cheerios! This was VERY good! Great recipe LTH!
5247	666	Wow! This is definitely very refreshing and not to mention a wonderful combination of colors and flavors. No matter what assortment of fresh fruit you use it's bound to be good so use your favorites and use the recipe as a guide. I added chopped peaches to mine and used fresh strawberries. Baking the chips keeps this a little healthier and lower in fat. So, for the cinnamon chips I used reduced fat tortillas and cut them with a pizza cutter which made things a lot easier. I sprayed them with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled them with the cinnamon sugar. I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes flipped them and baked them for another 7 minutes. They were crispy and delicious - next time I would double the amount because they went fast. This got a lot of compliments not only for taste, but for creativity. I'll definitely make this again - great recipe!
5248	666	Even the kids liked it.  Made the salsa with just strawberries and bananas with a little sugar for them.
5249	666	I accidentally bought the wrong size tortillas. I had the fajita size which looked like about 6." So, I used 5 instead of 3. I thought the cinnamon sugar looked like way to much. I did 1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon, and still had some left using half. This recipe and others do not say what type of cooking spray to use. I believe I bought the wrong one. Mine was more like a butter than a spray and my chips were kind of soggy! I think it means a cooking spray like Pam. I do not like kiwi, so I left that out, but added some chopped strawberries, but think the peach idea would have been better. I also added a couple sprinkles of sugar, as the chips already have sugar.
5250	666	needed something to keep my nieces and nephew happy and they would all eat.  This was GREAT! Made the chips in small batches (I did burn the first one) and found that I needed to clean the pan about every other batch as the sugar became burnt syrup when left on the pan. So very tasty and a creative way to use up some of my Kiwis.
5251	666	I am rating the chips only.  They were easy to make and very good.  I make my own fruit salsa recipe, from red apple, grapes, strawberries, peach and preserves.
5252	666	I used another reviewers advice and added peaches to the recipe. I made the cinnamon chips but also purchased a box of graham cracker sticks for my son to dip. Yum!
5253	666	This is always a huge hit at parties!  I add a small amount of sugar to the strawberries while blending and pair this salsa with the cream cheese/ marshmallow fluff dip.  Perfect!
5254	666	This is definitely a refreshing treat and a  healthy snack for the kids. We've used graham crackers or the graham cracker sticks for dipping too! If you really want to save time, throw the fruit into your food processor and just chop!
5255	666	Wonderful! So refreshing on a warm summer day. I made this take to a party and ended up eating a lot of it myself. Oops. Definitely a keeper.
5256	667	I made all three of these parfait recipes, and according to my husband, they are all "keepers."
5257	668	Really enjoyed this.  Subbed cod (frozen, from Costco) but  otherwise stuck to the recipe ingredients/directions.  Had mango salsa left over from a previous night - it went perfectly with the fish.  Made a black bean and brown rice combo to complement the fish.
5258	668	Big hit with the wife. She thought I should have saved it for Valentines Day.I prepared the fish per the recipe (3 minutes per side), though I did marinate it for two hours.For the salsa, I added fresh pineapple and next time will add more red onion.Served it over buttered, lemon and garlic basmati rice.Great recipe! Thank you.
5259	668	This recipe is absolutely delicious!!  I’m getting ready to make this for my second time.  I don’t like cilantro at all so I didn’t add that and I went ahead and diced a peach in with the mango salsa.  It’s soooo good, it’s like eating at a 5 star restaurant.  Paired well with lemon herb rice and lemon pepper broccoli on the side.
5541	705	Super easy, great flavors with the blackened salmon.  I used red onions instead of bell pepper.
5260	668	This mango salsa is delicious and can stand on its own. I think any fresh fish would go great with the salsa. BTW, I used an orange pepper instead of red and my family loved it.
5261	668	Really enjoyed this, as did the whole family
5262	668	This is the second time in two weeks that I have made this recipe! It's now my favorite tilapia recipe! The mango salsa is so refreshing!  This is definitely a keeper!
5263	668	I used Atlantic Haddock (we don't eat tilapia) and I left out the cilantro (yuck!). This was a five star meal. The salsa was fantastic. I added some ripe nectarines to the mango as my mango wasn't fully ripe. The nectarines sweetened it up....delicious!...Had it with caramelized maple sweet potatoes and freshly picked white corn.
5264	668	I've made this recipe twice in two weeks and i can see it being on the menu frequently at our house.  The salsa alone is fabulous.  First time i made with tilapia.  The second time i made it with seared tuna - same marinade and i put an extra jalapeno in the salsa.  A keeper for sure!
5265	668	Made exactly as written.
5266	669	It was very easy to make, it just took a little bit of time to chop everything, but that could have been since I made a quad batch! It was a big hit at my event and several people asked for the recipe. I'd never used mangos or jicama before and learned that you can peel them with an vegetable peeler.
5267	669	Love this salad!! So much fresher than   a plain old coleslaw.I ran out of  red peppers so I diced up  an avocado  and added it to the salad for colour.
5268	669	Awesome Used mangoes that were in a jar my red onion was a bit strong for the dish otherwise it was delicious
5269	669	Delicious!
5270	669	Delicious, perfect. Can't wait to put it on fish tacos tonight!!
5271	669	I love this recipe! Super easy, healthy and delicious ingredients with very little prep time required. I took it to a party and it was a hit! I love it when I see people going back for seconds and asking for the recipe. I’m making it again for my family tonight!
5272	669	Superb..but...very labor intensive, despite what one person said.  But well worth it!  I cut my jicama on the mandolin and after struggling mightily, due to how hard it was, I ended up only cutting half of it into matchsticks.  I was just worn out!   ( I put the other half of the sliced jicama in the fridge for later use).
5273	669	I cut all the ingredients the night before except the red onions ( can’t eat raw onions)
5274	669	Made this for our Father’s Day lunch yesterday. Everyone loved it!
5275	670	I got the tip from one of the reviews. Added lemon and lemon zest. So fruity indeed!
5276	670	Quick and easy recipe everyone seemed to enjoy. It's a do-again!
5277	670	I frequently make jam and can it (my family hasn't purchased jam in a decade). I used mangos that were probably more ripe than the author intended. I had 5 large mangos to mix with the syrup. I used a stick blender to mostly puree the mangos, leaving a couple of chunks for texture. I added the juice of half a lemon and the sliced peel (not the pulp) for added pectin and thickening power. I boiled all of that for about 30 min to get to soft jam consistency. The lemon helped to balance the sweetness and the added acid will help prevent spoilage. In the future, I would use a whole lemon and its peel. If you slice the peel thinly, it will break down nicely in the jam.
5278	670	Great recipe. I followed other recommendations and added only 1 cup of sugar with a bit of lime zest. it was enough sweet so I recommend to add only a cup of sugar. A definite keeper
5279	670	Too many mangos not enough jars... first time making this recipe, something to go on.
5280	670	I didn’t see anything about the expected yield. How many 1/2 pint jars should this recipe make?
5281	670	I made the recipe as is, minus the saffron as my mangoes were ripe and needed no help in color. I’m giving the recipe a 2 Star due to the jam not setting up at all even though the sugar mix set perfectly. I’m not sure if I had too much mango pulp or not enough pulp because I had no clue as to weight. Most kitchens don’t have a scale to measure 2 lbs of mangoes so I had to guess. Cups of mango chunks, purée would have been helpful vs. as written. I’m passing on using in the future but it was fun trying and it is delicious but will use it more as a topping for desserts than a jam.
5282	670	I followed the recipe exactly, substituting 1 Tblsp of ground ginger for the saffron. So good! I'm going to use some of it as a filling in a sweet bread braid I'm making. I can't wait to see how the bread turns out!
5283	670	Very easy to make! I doubled the cooking time and added Orange zest and it's delicious!
5284	671	I'm Italian I have to have more garlic I put it another Cobra garlic in there it seem to be pretty good after that
5285	671	Use a blender not a food processor. Definitely reduce the butter to 2 tablespoons.
5286	671	Very very good, heat level was lower than expected, next time I might add a few more habaneros. Also I used a mango instead of mango nectar. I believe this made the sauce thicker and stuck to the wings real nicely. I also substituted soy sauce with seasame seed oil which I think enhanced the flavor a little bit.
5287	671	So delicious we had to make them again after 2 days
5288	671	I used the half a stick of butter suggestion and it turned out amazing.
5289	671	very similar Buffalo Wild Wings recipe
5290	671	Could use half a stick of butter instead. More habanero for flavor and use a mango instead of juice.
5291	671	I made this to serve with my air-fryer wings.  I used my own homegrown habañeros fresh from the freezer (it’s December). Let me say that I can eat these at Buffalo Wild Wings all day long, but I, nor anyone else present, couldn’t eat three wing sections without needing a cool down. I added a second can of mango nectar and reduced again. It’s still hot enough to make my entire face burn nicely for 15 or 20 minutes. I think it was my sun ripened peppers, compared to the commercially  grown variety that made it so intense. Next time I'll try the store bought peppers..Still gets 5 stars!
5292	671	Love it!! This is my favorite mango habanero wing recipe, even over the restaurants! We made this and left the seeds in.. definitely spicy but has a sweet kick. I love spicy so if you can’t handle you should remove the seeds. The corn starch gives it the crunch which I love! This is definitely my favorite and we have saved the recipe to keep making, so delicious!!
5293	672	Delicious and elevated… so many levels of flavor, tantalizing the palate…But It’s supposed to have red bell peppers, red onions and cilantro in the salsa!
5327	675	The pie was AWESOME!! Everyone in my family loved it. I made mini pies (the size of cupcakes) and the only thing I changed was I didn't use any cornstarch, but it still turned out perfect.
5294	672	Made this recipe without the mango (though it sounds really good) as it was a last minute dinner and I didn't have mangos.  Served it with a cucumber salad dressed with rice vinegar.  Added some cilantro (as I had some on hand), chopped, to the rice for color and toasted some coconut flakes to mix into the rice.  I got raves - particularly on the rice.  It made a beautiful presentation and was SO QUICK AND EASY.  Be advised, it makes a lot of rice - I could have easily cut back by half and still had plenty.
5295	672	Excellent!  I did not cook the mango, just chopped it & used it fresh.
5296	672	I couldn’t get fresh mango, so I mixed some commercial mango salsa with chopped frozen mango and reduced the sugar in the “salsa” part of the recipe. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Watch the cooking time on broiling the fish (might need to pull it sooner than indicated), but overall, this recipe is pretty simple and yield incredible flavor and texture.
5297	672	So good!!!
5298	672	Fantastic!!!  I cut the pepper flakes in half and might even cut it back a bit more but overall wonderful flavor from the marinade. Didn’t add any sugar to the rice and used a different salsa since I had it already. Will make this again. Makes a ton of rice ??
5299	672	I didn't have mangos so i went with pineapple chunks in butter and brown sugar with 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. The rice was cooked in one cup water and one cup chicken broth.
5300	672	Added orange pepper to the mango salsa. Used slightly unripe mango and it created a delicious salsa
5301	672	I don’t usually eat fish but this was INCREDIBLE! My family and in-laws loved it! I followed the recipe exactly  for the fish marinade - minus the red pepper flakes. I did add the avocado, red onion, lime cilantro as others suggested and it added incredible flavor to the meal and tied in nicely with the mango and yummy rice!  This is a keeper for sure..restaurant quality!
5302	673	Loved it added more coconut and nuts and let the mango sit to create juice just to give it a better mango flavor. It’s delicious
5303	673	My family loved his bread. I’ve made it multiple times. The second time used extra large eggs and I doubled the coconut and it was perfect. I also melted the butter and then let it cool.  The flavor depends on the quality of the mangoes.
5304	673	Yum!  Our neighbor keeps giving us mangoes, so I keep making this bread!  I doubled it, and used 1 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, and I added two bananas to it.  Maybe next time I'll only add 3/4 cup white sugar; it was pretty sweet!  Very delicious!
5305	673	This was so moist and tasty.I used one 8x4x2 pan and two small ones, the small ones got done 10 minutes sooner than the larger pan. I followed the re pie as is.
5306	673	No leftovers. A good sign as any that says the recipe for this mango bread works. Thanks for sharing.Next time may tweak this recipe with some suggestions by commenters.
5307	673	This is my husband’s and my favorite. My wonderful neighbor would supply the mangos and I made bread for his family as well. Here are some adjustments I have made: Butter - 1/2 cup +1/4 cup coconut oilSugar-2/3 cup brown and 2/3 cup whiteUse unsweetened coconut.
5308	673	I used almond cassava flour blend and organic cane sugar 😍
5309	673	A friend called this the best mango bread she has ever eaten. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out. There are walnut haters in my household so I left the nuts out. The honey mango and coconut alone tasted great. I made these into mango muffins and cooked for about 25 minutes at altitude. Another friend asked me to make this again soon and I just might.
5310	673	It only made 1 loaf and halfSo I used  2 mini.loaf for remaing batter.Mango bread is delish. Second time making it.
5311	374	This was tasty and fun.  We used frozen fruit mix of mangos, pineapples, peaches and strawberries, and it turned out well.   We mixed it the evening before, but waited to add the Sprite until right before we served it.  In hindsight, we should have listened to the author and mixed it all together to rest overnight.  It was definitely better the 2nd day, with the flavors having had time to meld and the Sprite to blend.
5312	374	We made this to go with our Mexican themed dinner with friends.  It was a huge hit!  Since peaches weren't in season, we added raspberries, pears and strawberries.  It was tasty and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.
5313	374	I brought it to a family gathering and it was a huge hit!
5314	374	Love this and I get two treats out of it!
5315	374	I always run out and the dispenser is in the air while the last few guests are trying to get the last drop. It’s a big hit.
5316	374	I used 2 bottles of moscato, 1/2 cup of peach brandy, and 1/4 cup peach schnapps. It was a big hit!
5317	374	This recipe is amazing! Everyone LOVES it when I bring this sangria to the BBQ. First Sangria I ever made, super easy, I used Cavit Moscato wine, and it was perfect!
5318	374	This was delicious and loved by all. I made a couple changes. I used apricot brandy and Pinot Grigio.   It is a very versatile sangria and could be changed to your taste.
5319	374	This tastes like summer in your mouth! Especially great for an outdoor party! It was delicious. I didn’t use the full measure of peach schnapps based on other reviews. And just upped my fresh peaches. This was a big hit. Definitely a keeper.
5320	675	Everyone in my family really liked the pie but you didn't really taste the mango. They said it just tasted like really good pie but has no distinct flavor.
5321	675	I made this recipe and made one of the adjustment. I put a half a cup of shredded coconut for texture and for tropical taste. My husband was absolutely in love with his pie.?
5322	675	I’ve made this pie 5 times already in July as everyone who tried it wanted more.
5323	675	Good recipe. I used half of the cinnamon and was glad I did. Next time I’ll cut back on the cornstarch...1 tbsp would probably be enough.
5324	675	loved the pie several times now.    My last iteration I added 1/8 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cloves.  Really made the flavor pop!   I'm in Kenya, where mangos are between ten and thirty cents each while apples are hard to get.
5325	675	Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup. Made a Crisco crust recipe, 2/3 Crisco and 1/3 butter. Turned out d__n near perfect.
5326	675	Wonderful recipe with some adjustments - I did a mix of 2/3 mango and 1/3 peach since both of them were in season at the time.   Changed the 1/2 cup white sugar to half and half brown sugar to white sugar and doubled the cinnamon.  Also added a tablespoon of vanilla.  For the pie crust I made Ruth’s Grandma’s pie crust recipe from this site.  After a simple egg wash with sugar sprinkle on top it baked up beautifully - and was a complete hit.
5363	680	Great recipe! I made it with the beef and bean burritos recipe from this site and used it as a topping. Next time I'll add more heat to it.
5328	675	Absolutely awesome ran out of crusts for the top (4 store bought). Be careful about the amount of sugar start a little less and adjust to taste.  Used a crumble recipe that I tweaked (https://www.crazyforcrust.com/how-to-make-crumble-topping-for-fruit-pies/)  12  tbsp/170g butter, 2/3 cup/132 g of  brown sugar, 1 and 1/2 cups 180g of flour and 1/2 tbsp/4g of cinnamon (doubled it for the four pies). melt in your mouth good. my oven is spot on temperature wise so while I started the pies at 400f after 15 min I dropped the temperature to 350f. some pie requires ice cream this one the ice cream detracts from the desert.
5329	676	This salsa is AMAZINGLY tasty.  I substituted the ACV with Balsalmic Vinegar only because I was out.  We are not even "healthy" eaters necessarily, just had some ripe mangos that needed to be eaten and love fish tacos.  The only negative feedback was from my 22 year-old son who thought it was too sweet (he douses everything with habanero).  His loss -- the rest of us gobbled it up on the fish and with tortilla chips!
5330	676	The salsa was SO good! I only made half a batch, which was enough for the fish,  but if you want plenty leftover for chips, make all of it. The only change I made for the salsa was to cut the brown sugar in half, and it was perfect. The seasoning for the fish didn't sound very good to me, so I used homemade fajita seasoning instead. The cooking method was perfect. I didn't serve as a taco, but just put the salsa over the fish. I will make this again!
5331	676	The mango salsa is the star of the dish.  I did add cilantro to the salsa.  I also baked tilapia with a mexican spice rub, only as I prefer my fish baked.
5332	676	This was SO good!  Amazed at the flavor in the salsa.  Ended up being low on fish for the tacos so we could only have one.  Going to try the leftover salsa on some shredded chicken, but this is definitely a do-over dish.
5333	676	Just delicious
5334	676	I needed a recipe for mahi-mahi which was on sale.  I made the salsa as the recipe said except that I used dried parsley flakes. I ended up just serving it on the pieces of grilled fish as I had no tortillas.  It was delicious, my husband really liked it, and I will make it again.
5335	676	I swapped out fish for chicken because I personally don’t like fish that much and this was just fantastic!!! I have been eating the salsa with chips all the time and it’s delicious! definitely will make again!
5336	676	This was so good!
5337	676	This salsa is so good. The only thing I changed was the red onion, not a fan otherwise so yummy. I've also made it with some fresh cod my husband brought home. It was even better than the mahi.
5338	677	I made this for the sole purpose of sauce for chicken wings. I think it would be too sweet to just dip chips in but it was excellent as a wing sauce. The habanero's I used were pickled in a jar so I'm not sure if that made any difference heat wise . You get the sweet at first and then the heat comes in from behind. It was spicy, yes but that is what habanero's do best.
5339	678	Enjoyed this nicely flavored smoothie. I made it exactly as recipe specified (without honey) and it was delicious. This will be my go-to protein shake.
5340	678	It was absolutely delicious! My kids said it was the best smoothie ever!
5341	678	Love it.
5342	678	Nice balance of flavors.  I used coconut yogurt.
5343	678	this smoothy was delicious but I feel like the mango flavor was kinda washed out other than that though it was a delicious smoothy
5344	678	I used coconut cream and milk instead of yogurt and almond milk, and used vanilla extract instead of protein powder.  It was pretty good, and made a tasty, filling breakfast, although, even when I added more mango, It lacked some flavor.
5345	678	I was just looking to make a mango smoothie without the protein, so I took out the protein powder and the smoothie still taste great!
5346	678	My kids said this was the best smoothie they've ever had. Thank you Lela!!
5347	678	Perfect .... thank u!
5348	679	Makes a very nice sauce to go with baked fish.  I baked a cut of Dugso, a fish common to the Philippines.  Combines very well.  I have also used apple to make this instead of mango, also very food.
5349	679	Absolutely delicious!  Couldn't find a Thai chili pepper so I sub'd 1/4 of a habenero.  Otherwise, I followed recipe exactly.
5350	679	Loved this relatively simple recipe that is so versatile and becomes the centerpiece of the meal. Used it on grilled halibut first night, grilled salmon the next and just ate the remainder straight out of the bowl with a spoon. I coated the fish with olive oil and a sprinkle of chili powder before grilling which complemented the mango sauce nicely. I could not find the Thai pepper so I used a Serrano and left about half of the seeds/membrane in to make sure there was enough kick. That seemed to work perfectly.
5351	679	A real crowd pleaser. I should have made more. Chef John's video is definitely helpful as usual. Made the recipe as written. Had to go to a local Asian grocery to find the Thai chili pepper. Served with pork tenderloin and shrimp appetizers cooked on the Big Green Egg.
5352	679	This was very tasty and easy! Letting it sit helped the flavors a lot
5353	679	I have a mango tree and mangoes are falling like there is no tomorrow. So, I searched up mango sauce and this was the first recipe to come out. This is so delish!!! I had to change it up a little since I didn't have all the ingredients. I had unseasoned rice vinegar which I seasoned with Italian seasoning. Then I added Thai chili sauce, some red pepper flakes, the mango, green onions, cilantro, and lemon juice. OMG! So yummy! I think this would be a great combo with ceviche. Thank you for the great recipe!
5354	679	I just made it!! I used it as a marinade instead of just a sauce. I haven't cooked my fish yet but so far the mango sauce alone is so good
5355	679	It tastes great. American mangoes are a bit rubbish, but I was fairly pleased with the results I got rehydrating dried mangoes from the Philippines. One pack is just the right amount, I think.
5356	679	Great over salmon!
5357	680	Wonderful taste, no sugar is needed if your mangoes are ripe. I canned the extras, hopefully it tastes just as good as fresh made.
5358	680	I used this recipe to replace a package mix by Fresh Express. I added crushed pineapple and it was pretty close to my old mix. Best thing about this salsa is you can add all kinds of substitutes.
5359	680	Delicious! I added half a can of black beans, as well, and it was perfect!
5360	680	Yum yum yum! Great way to use up any tomatoes when you start getting the large crop towards the end of summer. Chop up your tomatoes and let them sit while your prepare the rest of the ingredients. Drain the excess juice from them and mix it all
5361	680	easy recipe, it's a winner
5362	680	Followed recipe as is... yum!
5366	681	I just made this,followed directions and all. If you don't blend the ice/mangoes together, and put all ingredients in and THEN blend? It's hard to blend everything,so.....1st,I'd recommend blending mangoes and ice (don't overblend!!), THEN finish blending all rest of ingredients. You have to put mangoes,ice,yogurt( this order- it will blend better!!) And then rest of ingredients. Stir after and enjoy!
5367	681	This was really really good! The first time I made it, I used fresh mangoes. It was good, it just had a LOT of pulp in it. If you like pulp, maybe that's not such a big deal, but I was kinda off-put by the texture. I then read all the comments telling me to use frozen mangoes instead of fresh. I made it again using frozen mangoes and I can confirm, it was a million percent better. Tho, if you're going to go that route, I would add the frozen mangoes and ice cubes a little bit at a time, then blend it, then add some more and repeat. I put all the frozen mangoes in at once (I doubled the recipe btw), and my blender couldn't chop all of them. On my first batch, I still had chunks of frozen mango in there. Overall I really enjoyed it, and I will definitely make it again throughout the summer!
5368	681	We love this smoothie. When making this decadent drink, I always double the recipe when using frozen mangoes and I omit the ice cubes. When using fresh mangoes,  I don't double the recipe because I have to use 5 small mangoes for the original recipe! I did not use vanilla extract because the vanilla yogurt was enough, and added 3 tbl of sugar because it's rather dull without it. Thick and delish!
5369	681	Pretty good.  I like sweet so will add some honey next time overall simple and delicious.
5370	681	Just what I was looking for.  I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of apple juice.  I needed a little more liquid because I eyeballed the yogurt and it was too thick.
5371	681	To much vanilla and sooo. Messy
5372	681	I used 1/2 & 1/2, vanilla, and mango and when I tasted it I actually yelled "Wow!" it was so good. Definitely going to be running the stores out of mangoes. Also, I use a mango tool and it splits it and takes the seed out in under 10 seconds. Mine is Oxo but there are other brands, all about $12. Totally worth it.
5373	681	This is my go-to smoothie anytime of the year. This is fantastic!
5374	681	It was really good. It just had quite a lot of mango in it. I added a nice mint leaf on top for decoration
5375	682	Me and my mom made this cake for my brothers birthday! He and everyone else that tried it loved it!! But from the Previous reviews we changed it from using a yellow cake box mix to a French vanilla cake box mix and it made it much more moist and yummy! But, a lot of math was required because the 2 different cake mixes had different amounts. We also used more mangos and it gave it a lot of flavor. So in the end, we tapered with the recipe but if you want this amazingly moist and delicious cake.... USE THIS RECIPE!!!
5376	682	Since I used the Costco jar of mango, I had lots of juice, which I used instead of the water for the cake, and for the glaze.  Bigger mango taste, and very moist.  No photo, coz the cake was still warm-my first glaze ever.    Oops.  The lime really compliments the sweet from the  c-sugar.
5377	682	I didn’t have a yellow cake mix so I used a French vanilla and boy did the mango flavour pop. My brother in-law who is an Aussie liked it so much he had two huge pieces.
5378	682	Delish!
5379	682	I had gotten amazing mangoes from Costco that I used, they were obviously in season. The cake to me didn't seem to taste much different from a regular yellow cake besides being a little more  dense from the mango. The glaze was the best part. I only used a little under 1/2 Tablespoon of rum and that was more than enough. I surprisingly wasn't so crazy about the cake but everyone who had a piece absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it again already.
5380	682	I used 2  mangoes for the  puree and it still tasted too much like yellow box cake mix.
5381	682	Good tasting cake but I too had an issue with the mango juice. I had none, juice that is. So I wound up squeezing the juice of 1 lime, adding the melted butter and omitting the rum. I didn't measure the powdered sugar, I just added a little at a time until it reached the consistency of a glaze. I liked the tartness of the glaze but I found it over powered the subtle taste of the mango. I will make this again but I will make sure that I have 2 ripe mangos, 1 for the cake and 1 for the glaze.
5382	682	Nice cake... a few issues. My mango didn't have any juice to separate for glaze, so I put it in a fine mesh strainer to get that. No big deal, but just be aware this might happen. Th big issue I had was the glaze. I was takeing this to church where kids were so I didnt know how well the small amount of rum taste would go over with them, so I subbed that with an extra T of lime juice. Problem.. this still no where near a glaze.. was a dried powder with lumps. I had no more fresh lime but did have a bottle of lime juice in the fridge.. so I started adding.. more and more to get a glaze. It was very strong flavored as  result, but when eaten with the cake was quite good. Next time I make this.. I will use less sugar and instead of all the lime juice, I'd use water or even coconut water would be nice. The adults liked this and with the tartness of my glaze I would say it was more suited for grownup tastes. For kids, watch the amount of lime juice if you need to thin this out.. which I did
5383	683	Awesome salad. Dressing is good  but I didn’t put all of it on...it wasn’t. Necessary.  Will definitely make this again!
5384	683	very simple to make and great tasting :)
5385	683	Just what i was looking for! for the dressing i omitted fish sauce and brown sugar and just did a splash of lime juice since the mangoes i had were sweet and ripe:) Thanks!
5386	683	This took me by surprise.  It is good, but I don't know if it is the fish sauce or what that really makes it taste like something you like, but can't eat much of.  The texture of it feel strange in the mouth.  Keeping it in my recipe box, but don't think I could have this more than maybe once or twice a year.
5387	683	Lovely fresh salad. Flavours balanced nicely. I think the fish sauce was too strong so I would only use half the amount called for next time and add more red pepper. Thanks for sharing abcgirl
5388	683	Tasty! All of the flavors complimented each other nicely...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
5389	684	I used a full bag of cubed frozen mango from Trader Joe’s. For the syrup I used 3/4 of a cup of water, half a cup of sugar and I squeezed half of a large juicy lime (about 1/4 cup). Brought the syrup to a boil then chilled in the refrigerator. I put all the ingredients in my blender and puréed then poured into my ice cream maker and churned for 10 minutes. I like lime so I also sprinkled the top with lime zest.
5390	684	This is really good sorbet. I wish there were measurements for the mangos instead of number of mangos. I had huge mangos so I just used about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of cubed fruit. It was really sweet. Next time I will cut down on the amount of simple syrup and add a little more lime juice.
5391	684	This recipe was my inspiration, as I had many mangos ripe at the same time.  Trying to reduce white sugar in our house, I made the simple syrup with monk fruit.  Proportions are exactly the same as white sugar, but please note I used half the amount of simple syrup the recipe required.  The result was phenomenal.  Everyone was happily surprised it contained no white sugar.  A summer delight!
5392	684	It’s been years since I first made this recipe.  Last night when I made this, I used a food processor as prescribed for the first time. It made the consistency smooth and delicious. I would guess I used a blender before. Anyway, this is such an easy and delicious recipe. It was a great dessert after our skillet paella. I will keep this recipe forever!

5394	684	Just made it.  My husband and daughter loved it.  I made the simple syrup with 1 cup of water and 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup sugar.  It was really good.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe!
5395	684	This turned out great. I used a food processor on accident when I meant to do the blender but oh well. It turned out great and I served it to my parents at dinner with lotus cookies. It was a lot of work cutting the mangos but soooooo worth it. I made it by myself and it was very easy.
5396	684	Absolutely delicious!
5397	684	I tried it your way and it was very good, but I tried it with frozen peaches and skipped step 2 and it took a lot less time, but it still  tasted the same.
5398	685	A fantastically moist and fluffy cake! It received the household's high praise. Where I live, the tinned, sweetened mango pulp is called 'alphonso mango' and can be obtained in very large tins.I think the next time I make this, I will try a pineapple upsidedown cake with almonds instead of cherries. I have high hopes!
5399	685	I used fresh pureed mangoes, this ade a really thick batter. I added extra sugar and milk to make it more normal cake batter thickness. Even with adding orange and almond extract it was on the bland side. since i didn;t have slivered almonds, I mixed almond flour with a little sugar to make a streusel-like crumb topping, it helps the flavor. But it is a nice moist, dense cake.
5400	685	Easy recipe but took way longer to bake. Knowing that , I'd have dropped oven temp a bit as it browned too quickly. Won't bother with this one again.
5401	685	Moist and delish, it's a keeper.
5402	685	I made mango cake as per instructions.... everybody loved it in my family. Thank you!
5403	685	I made this as instructed,,, it was quite good,,, not fluffy but very moist as most fruit based cakes are.  flavor was  very good, my wife really liked it...   I used a fresh mango instead of the juices.  added a honey glaze to top it off.  I will continue to make this as my wife is a very big mango fan!!!!
5404	685	I made this the first time exactly as instructed and found it moist but dense (butter/margarine was not creamed into sugar or mixture ).  I made it the second time creaming the sugar and butter/marg first, then adding one egg at a time and mixing well between eggs,  then adding the mango pulp with  one mashed mango and a few dashes of cinnamon (because I had a mango on hand) added to pulp to equal  1 and 3/4 cup and adding the flour ingredients (sifted well together)  last until just combined which is normally how a cake or loaf is done and found it to be far superior than the first instruction on this site.  Now it has a four star rating and with cinnamon whipped cream (ice cream or frozen yogurt) it was five stars.  I also want to try this again with a mango sauce of some sort to enhance the mango flavor and a bit of almond flavoring in batter to enhance the almonds on top.
5405	685	08-03-16 ~ A nice cake that we liked, but our neighbors loved it. It is moist with a light flavor. I couldn't find canned sweetened mango pulp, so I made my own. (3 mangos, 2 TB powered sugar, 1/4 cup milk - put all in blender until smooth). The sauce was incredible. Before serving, we poured the leftover sauce over the cake. The cake did go to an all new level of taste appeal.
5406	686	One of our favorite fish recipes
5407	686	I love it!
5408	686	Never rinse tuna steaks they will separate. I don't agree with cooking them nearly that long unless you like well done fish. Just sear them for a better experience.
5409	686	I made this last Friday night for supper. It was super delicious!The only thing that I did differently was I added a bit of freshly grated ginger to the salsa. It adds another layer of flavorful heat to the dish
5410	686	My husband doesn't eat seafood, but he LOVES this dish!!!
5411	686	This one of those recipes where you should first read the comments. Tasty but way too spicy. As in have some yogurt to get some feeling back in your lips.
5412	686	Wow, what a interesting combination to my palate. I had half set aside for leftovers tomorrow. Hum wonder what I’m cooking tomorrow night.
5413	686	Use this recipe just for the blackened seasoning mix. Perfect every time!
5414	686	I loved it! Was a bit spicy but delicious! This was my first time making it and I have made it once more since and also used this recipe for mahi-mahi as well!
5415	687	Very nice. I didn't have bananas on hand, so I added a little more mangoes and added 1 tbl of honey. Thick and yummy.
5416	687	Made same as recipe, came out really good
5417	687	This was so yummy and creamy! I was surprised that the flavors worked together, but they do. I followed the recipe and then added about 2 cups of spinach. Turned out great!
5418	687	This is a great recipe and my wife and kids love it. I have been on a green smoothie kick and am not real fond of banana so I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added 2 cups of spinach and a cup of water. Instead of a full banana I used a half of a banana and a half of an avocado. I also bumped up the mango to a cup. My 13 year old son has early morning football practice and he said this is by far the best smoothie for him to start his day and give him an early morning boost.
5419	687	All of these ingredients work well together, very creamy smoothie.  In the future, I will a little vanilla extract, think that will enhance the flavor.
5420	688	it was amazing
5421	688	It was okay. Next time I would use less watermelon. All I could taste was it. Didn't add the water no need to. Instead of sugar I add 1 packet of Splenda. And added half of cup of plain low-fat yogurt. Poured over ice
5422	688	it was horrible drink it didn't look like the color so she probably forgot a ingredient oh wait  she did
5423	688	Terrible.  It did not blend well, and then had no real taste to it.
5424	688	Instead of ice, I used 2 cups of diced frozen organic mangoes. I also used coconut water instead of plain water. It was a light pinkish color until I added hemp protein powder. I didn't add any sugar. For a thicker smoothie, you can add yogurt.  Thanks for the recipe:)
5425	688	With 5C of watermelon & only one mango, his is a red, not yellow drink, and does *not* need any sugar. It's just OK... I added 1/4 protein powder, ice, & probiotic powder. It needs to be thicker to be a smoothie (other suggest adding yogurt... You could consider frozen bananas to go full-on tropical). Might only use this conceptually as a base if I again have extra mango & watermelon...
5426	688	I would cut the sugar in half - a bit on the sweet side and instead of water - add your favorite Moscatto!!  BAM!!  :)
5427	688	My smoothie didnt look like the pic mine was more pink in colour and if I made this again I woulnt be adding the sugar.
5428	688	I did not care for this recipe.
5429	689	I used frozen mango chunks brought to room temperature and cake flour with the adjustment compared to enriched white flour (extra 2 tsp. per cup). They didn't brown and were undercooked even after adding time for both. No sweetness and didn't taste like mango. I was quite disappointed since I made them for the teens' bake sale at church. Oh, well. Photo is of the muffins after they were browned under the broiler. Still no better.
5430	689	My first time cooking with mangoes since moving to Florida.  My cousin gave me fresh ones from her tree.  My muffins were weighed down and were nearly flat.  I determined that the mangoes were too many, too ripe and too juicy.  What a waste!  Should have used in rice or made ice cream.  Lesson learned.
5431	689	My muffins were wet!!! Baked for 30 minutes but never dried out.
5432	689	Great!  Made it with modifications, some as recommended by other reviewers, and it is moist and flavor is subtle, not too sweet, exactly the way we like it.
5433	689	I followed the recipe exactly and found the muffins to be heavy. I think it should read three mangoes instead of three cups. Three cups was way to much.  It also seemed to be a bit bland. Maybe some type of extract to give it some zip.
5434	689	mmmmmmmm
5435	689	These muffins were fantastic!  I made them for snack at my daughter's school and the kids all raved and requested them for next snack day.  Even the picky kids liked them.  They're moist and very tasty.  This is a keeper!
5436	689	This was a super moist muffin that showcased the mango.  I was looking for something that didn’t have coconut and this fit the bill.  Super yummy with an afternoon cup of tea.
5437	689	Followed the recipes exactly and got beautiful results. I love that the sweetness of the mango is the star feature. Most recipes call for too much sugar. A little almond extract would up the mango flavor I think.
5438	690	Needs wayyy less oil and vinegar, plus I added some shredded carrots
5439	690	This was a fabulous change from my regular slaw.  I will prepare this every time I make slaw!!!
5440	690	This was very tasty with beef barbacoa and pork carnitas tacos. I didn’t change it in anyway and would def make it again.
5441	690	Made exactly as stated. Served or marinated pork tacos, and it was fantastic.
5442	690	I took this great idea and ran with it.
5443	690	Better than I expected.  The perfect complement to Mahi-mahi tacos.
5444	690	Great on fish tacos!
5445	690	Nice twist in the traditional coleslaw. Like that it only uses 2 TBSP of mayo as opposed to my reg dressing which is half a cup. Will make again.
5446	690	This was so easy and so good. I absolutely loved it. I added red onion and jalapeño with a little bit of the seeds for a little heat
5447	691	It was good :)
5448	691	I made it with almond milk instead of orange juice, and coconut yogurt instead of plain, and it came out absolutely perfect! I also grounded up the oats before
5449	691	added vanilla protein powder
5450	691	Delicious and hearty smoothie.
5451	691	I added a bit of milk, lots of ice, 1 mango chopped up, half of a banana, orange juice with mango flavor, coconut flavored Greek yogurt, granola and a bit of water. It was the right amount of sweetness and texture was nice and smooth! Def recommend this for afternoon snack or breakfast smoothie!
5452	691	Really yummy! I put about 2 cups of orange juice in so there would be enough liquid. I used fage 0% greek yogurt. I put about 1/2 cup of oats instead of 1/4, 1 cup of mango instead of 1/2 and one full small banana instead of 1/2.
5453	691	Awesome. Definitely one of my favorites
5454	691	Yummy! I love smoothies with oatmeal in them .The frozen mango i used had carrots in the mix, and I added a splash of cashew-almond milk to thin it out a little. Loved the flavors!
5455	691	I recently purchased a Vitamix blender and have been searching for smoothie recipes that my family will enjoy. This was refreshing and full of flavor. I substituted a peeled orange for the orange juice and added a half a cup of milk in order to have enough liquid. I didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla instead. I'll definitely make this again, great recipe.
5456	398	Love it
5457	398	Loved this so much! I had to improvise quite a bit because I did not have fresh fruit, so I used frozen peaches and mangoes (no pineapple). I love recipes like this that are conducive to using what you have on hand. Also had to leave out the yellow pepper but I had everything else. Used as a topping for carne al pastor over black beans & rice. OMG, I loved this! Can't wait to make it again.
5458	398	I left the mango and peaches out and it was very good anyway. Served it with Mahi Mahi and coconut rice. Just perfect!
5459	398	Loved this! Only thing I did different was add a little white wine vinegar but this is amazing!
5460	398	Awesome recipe!!! I doubled and going to try freezing and canning so I can have in winter. Used all fresh ingredients. I love cilantro so put as much as you want!
5461	398	Delicious!  We loved it. It makes a big batch.
5462	398	Turned out great. The whole family loved it.
5463	398	I added black beans  sweet corn, red onion and some garlic lime cilantro seasoning! Just amazing and delicious!
5464	398	Adjustments:
5465	693	Excelent!!! Great recipie
5466	693	It only made 4 jars, 1/2 pint size, had to add pectin to firm up. Good, be careful not to use too much vinegar.
5467	693	I made it exactly however, it only made 4  8 oz jars
5468	693	Cooking the chutney without a lid makes in much thicker
5469	693	I made this recipe as is. Then I put Mango chutney in a blender and pureed it. I canned it for years to come. Delicious!
5470	694	This is really delightful. I used red onion instead of white and doubled the amount. Used a mixture of prunes, apricots, and craisins too as I did not have raisins.. I’ve topped my salmon with this chutney. Topped cream cheese sandwiches. Delicious.
5471	694	This was a mess for me. Following it to the letter and at end it was a runny mess..to much time for trial and error. Don't bother with this one!
5472	694	This was an extremely delicious recipe my only critique is that i wish it had a thicker consistency.
5473	694	I only added one red hot chili pepper and for us that was enough for us.  However, if you like it really spicy go ahead and put all five.  Great recipe!
5474	694	Came out good, i cut the recipe for just two 6 0z bottles
5475	694	I down sized the recipe to 40 servings. Even then I ended up freezing some. I usually buy the store chutney from Major Grey, but I wanted to try making it myself. Not to mention the price of a jar at the store is almost 6 bucks where I live. I used it on some bacon wrapped pork tenderloins, and the flavor was fantastic. On the batch I made, I did not add the Allspice. Even though I loved this recipe, I think the next time I make this, I will use all white granulated sugar to lighten the color. The brown sugar for me was the reason for the darker color. Even as you just start the cooking process, it's already a darker color.  I was careful to not burn my chutney, and it turned out great.
5476	694	I scaled this WAY down to 4 servings, as I needed it for another recipe. I skipped the golden raisins, as I didn't have any. I used this to top some grilled salmon. My husband and son didn't really care for it (too sweet for them), but I enjoyed it.
5477	694	I made a third of recipe to first try and tweaked it to go with pork dishes I had planned. I used apple vinegar and added some apple and apple sauce. I love the sauce taste and the fresh ginger root is what made it over the top.
5478	694	sugar burnt, became a huge mess that took forever to clean up. :(
5479	695	My families first poke bowl. I didn't change anything. Very good. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
5480	695	This was fantastic!  Added some fresh spinach on top.
5481	696	Not my taste but it could be suitable for someone else. It's very creamy which I like, but maybe I should've added more sugar.
5482	696	I was skeptical, not being much of a milk drinker, but I had two ripe mangoes to use so figured what the heck. I subbed vanilla extract for half the recipe amount of almond extract (I was out of vanilla) and it is overpowering with the almond extract - but not to the point where I won’t drink it. I gave this recipe 5 stars because despite the almond extant disappointment I can tell that this is going to be a wonderful drink once I get more vanilla. I will likely reduce the amount of vanilla called for in the recipe - probably by half and adjust from there for flavor. Overall, I love this drink and can’t wait to try it according to the recipe ingredients!!
5483	696	Thx. Niyola. This is awesome
5484	696	My whole family loved this mango drink. I didn't have enough ice cubes, so I used almost frozen milk to make up the difference. This recipe is going in my favorites.
5485	696	7.22.17  My mango was at its peak ripeness, and this morning,  I enjoyed an absolutely delicious, creamy, full fruit flavor breakfast drink, and I even used skim milk.  I really think of this as a smoothie, more than a drink, but call it what you like, just give it a try  I like the nutritional breakdown on this, as well, and I know this will be making a repeat performance soon!  Niayola, thanks for sharing your recipe.
5486	697	I was introduced to this recipe by the Zoe Nutrition Study. The mango salsa was great and complimented the salmon well. I microwaved a salmon fillet with fresh ginger and soy sauce for more flavour.
5487	697	Well, this recipe passed my 93 year old mom’s critique- she said, “Not too bad, lacks a little flavor, but overall the strong salmon flavor and the smooth mango salsa (I had to blend for swallowing purposes) complimentary  (favorable).”
5488	697	This dish was so easy to make and treated great.  Skipped the cilantro not a fan used thyme instead and added jalapeños to kick it up a bit..
5489	697	I made it as listed and it was great, next time I think a bit of heat to go with the sweet. Maybe a bit of habanero with the onions/garlic?
5490	697	Followed recipe and we loved it
5491	697	Excellent!!! Mango salsa was great and salmon was perfect! Added a bit of ginger, too!
5492	697	This recipe was so scrumptious !  My husband loved it, my 8 eight year loved it, and I was so impressed!  The cilantro with the mango dressing was divine.  I did change one thing to the recipe, I put a few pads of butter and a little brown sugar on the salmon before broiling.  The tenderness of the salmon was unbelievable.  I will be saving this one!
5493	697	Easy to follow, it all came out really well. However, what I thought was a tomato turned out to be a persimmon sooo my dish came out a little different but delicious nonetheless.
5494	697	Easy and delicious!
5495	698	The changes I made were based on availability in my kitchen. I used red onion vs shallots, 1 smaller Thai green chilli (it makes it extra spicy hot) and a full lime regardless of size.    I got a rave review on my adapted version and have made it continually all summer.  Thank you for the recipe!
5496	698	Awesome!! Made it without the red pepper flakes first, since the friends we were making it for don’t do spicy. Still delicious. Added the red pepper the next day. Yummy!! Everyone loved it. So easy and delicious.
5497	698	Easy to make.  A novel Thanksgiving side dish.  ;)    Yum.  Heat and Sweet!  However we do not like it with  olive oil.  Another splash of juice or vinegar improves drastically.
5498	698	I used only half of the pepper flakes called for in the recipe. It was still yummy and good for friends who are not so fond of really spicy foods.
5499	698	This is very good
5500	698	The hardest part is chopping the mangoes...and it is equivalent to our local Thai restaurant.  Thanks for a great recipe!
5501	698	This is an awesome recipe to have fun with.  After making it many times, I don't use olive oil, scallions or red pepper.  Instead, put coarsely diced mango in large bowl.  Add 4-6 sliced green onions. Dice the avocados and drizzle with juice from half a lime to prevent browning.  Add to mango.  Put remaining lime juice in a small bowl along with 3 tbsp sweet chili sauce. Add cilantro and 1...or 2! deseeded, finely diced jalapeños. Whisk to combine and then pour over mango, gently folding everything together. Cover and put in fridge for 20-30 minutes. Mix once to blend flavors. Thanks to MIRELLE67 for the original recipe!
5502	698	I would just suggest 1/2 of the red pepper flakes. It gets spicier as it sits in your refrigerator. Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars
5503	698	Loved this!!  So simple and tasty.  Next time I'll use red onion as shallots are a bit overpowering.  Chopped up little that was left over and put over grilled salmon - Yummy!!
5504	699	Its good, we eat it  with chicken biryani  rice, we always have it whenever we have the biryani rice.
5505	699	Not what I expected. Turned out more bland than I expected but I think not enough fruit flavor. Will try to use fresher fruit and more of it.
5506	699	I substituted Sultana raisins for 2 of the mangoes, because I only had one.  It turned out just fine.
5507	699	I made some subtle changes, just a bit more ginger.  I absolutely love this chutney.  It is refreshing and goes well with salmon, chicken and lamb.  Easy to make and keeps well in the refrigerator.  Although, mine didn't have a chance to get spoiled. It was eaten quickly.  It makes a bunch so keep a quart and give another as a gift.
5508	699	Made this to go with the ham at Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit. I used frozen mangos and estimated the amount. Turned out delicious!!!
5509	699	left out the mangoes, and used red bell pepper instead for a little color.  also used 1 tbsp of yellow curry powder, with 1/2 tbsp of mild curry paste.  it was amazing.  the sweetness of the pineapple with the curry kick, and the ginger...oh my gosh it was so delicious.  we used this as a topping for slow-cooker Kalua pork.
5510	699	Spectacular! Had to make a minor change; I didn't have curry powder, so used mild curry paste, which worked fine. This has just a hint of background heat and didn't overpower the grilled halibut. It's going on grilled pork loin tonight.
5511	699	I made it exactly as the recipe stated, I make many variety's of Chutney's and Jellies to sell in bake sales for charity. This was perfect, great colour  and texture. I used our home made blend of Curry Powder which made it a bit on the hot side But perfect for spicy food lovers. Today I am making another batch with just a teaspoonful of our home made curry powder ,it should be just about perfect again.
5512	699	This recipe is the best one yet! Followed all directions and turned out incredible!! Only difference I did was about 10 minutes before done, I add some wild red shrimp and served over fluffy white rice!!!
5513	700	I wish the quantity for each ingredient was more detailed. I would have liked it if it was explained whether I should cook the fish or not.
5514	700	I made this pretty much as the recipe called for I cut it almost in half and still ended up with a lot! It was fabulous! Sweet, refreshing wonderful! The cilantro what is especially nice.  I recommend adding the avocado when you serve it. Good luck.
5515	700	Delicious! I added a teaspoon of sugar, just to cut the acidity. It was a real hit in our house, and we will be making it again soon!
5516	700	I haven't actually made this yet but as I watched the video, I couldn't help but question why you would call a serrano pepper a jalapeño and use an avocado that was so turning bad. I have always found your recipes to be very good ... and this may be as well. As someone who loves to cook and worked for many years in marketing and advertising  on many a restaurant client ... the food stylist, art director and client should all have known better. I don't make a habit of commenting but this just cried out for one.
5517	700	Easy and delicious!
5518	700	This was a great recipe.  Maybe a little too much mango and the sweetness overpowered the fish a bit but this is probably because the mangos are so big here. I added cucumbers to it as well.  I think avocados at the end might be a good addition.  Very well done!
5519	701	It is yummy. However, we have to be dairy free so I added a 13oz. can of coconut milk and I used fresh ripe mangoes pureed in my blender. Very delicious.
5520	701	i made lots adjustments-n added 8 oz coconut cream instead of eval milk and water
5521	701	I made a similar recipe but instead of evaporated milk the recipe calls for heavy whipping cream. I prefer that one over this one since it is creamier.
5522	702	I cut the recipe in half, used Mangos from a jar and added a touch of cinnamon. Easy to make this way. It took about a half hour to put together.
5523	702	Delicious! I made a Mango Cobbler once before almost 20 years ago; developed my own recipe and it was delicious. I made a pie crust, with lattice crust topping. This was less time consuming. Put my own spin on it, enhanced flavors a little, loved this recipe.
5524	702	I didn’t like this much, but I would be willing to try it
5525	702	This was a delicious recipe. I had to substitute the milk for a nut milk because I don’t eat or drink dairy products and it was still super delicious!
5526	702	This is a good recipe which won the admiration of my guests... I would say heating mango with the sugar and water is a step that could be skipped to avoid the cobbler being too liquidy and taking longer to bake.
5527	702	I had to cut back on the sugar but, this is our of this world delicious!
5528	702	Very tasty. I added a tsp each of cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg to the batter to give it flavor. I used peaches and mangos because that’s what I had and it was a perfect combo. I just subbed 1 peach for 1 mango. I would not put the entire 2 cups of syrup on top. The batter is very wet already, I added only 1/2 a cup extra.
5529	702	This cobbler was amazing ! I did substitute self rising for the all purpose,salt and baking powder... and left out the water. I also used a bit less sugar than called for and it still turned out plenty sweet. I will definitely make this again. I believe using any fruit you have on hand would also work, lyk :)
5530	702	I bought a 26 oz can of mangoes in syrup but no one liked them.  So I used it in this recipe and it turned out  DELICIOUS!  I omitted the step of making syrup and simply used the syrupy juice from the can instead.  I estimated that this size can was 3-4 mangoes worth, so I cut the entire recipe in half.  The amounts of the ingredients were just right!
5531	703	I just made them im concerned if its enough gelatin though
5532	704	It was Okay. We messed up on the blending part and didn't blend it long enough. Also, you should peel the peach because all of the peach peels showed in the smoothie.
5533	704	I used a whole orange instead of orange juice.  Very delicious
5534	704	A new favorite. Creamy and reminds me of a deamscile.
5535	704	I used frozen mango and canned peaches. It was OK, but a bit tart. A little honey would have helped. I think I prefer these fruits with a ripe banana for some added sweetness. It was very smooth.
5536	704	5.6.17   Mango and peach is a good combination for a smoothie.  Used frozen fruit, so the consistency was how I like it, a bit on the thick side.  Nice mid-morning snack.
5537	704	It was okay, but all I could taste was the peaches. I like to taste the mango too. It was still good though.
5538	704	This was good--but, i think I would add some Greek yogurt next time.
5544	705	Fantastic. I used old bay seasoning. One mango was enough but it was large. Very good Everyone loved it.
5545	705	this was yummy, a bit labor intensive with the salsa and in my opinion there's too much salsa for the fish, double the fish and you'll be good. will make again, maybe with a tad more heat!
5546	705	Really good!
5547	705	This was so easy / healthy and delicious! I had left overs will be eating tomorrow , the lime helps the avocado not turn brown so all good. Will be making again for sure and highly recommend
5548	705	Salsa was amazing.  Added red onion and garlic powder and extra salt.
5549	705	Yummy Recipe  very fresh and tasty. All I would change is add some red onion and tomato. I also added some sriracha sauce and it added a nice kick to them
5550	706	This recipe was easy and delicious.My peppers were sorta on the mild side, so I added them all back in the pot.Good and spicy.
5551	706	Fun fact: if you blend the fruits and habaneros, but only use 3 habaneros, it comes out kinda runny and goes AMAZING with vanilla ice cream. 42/10 will make again.....and again.....and again.....and again
5552	706	I cannot keep enough jars of this on hand! Everyone loves it! Every time I make it, the jam is liquidy more like chutney, of course when put in the fridge if firms up a bit. What am I doing wrong? I have made this several times with fresh and once with frozen fruit. Same result either way. Hasn't stopped people from asking for it, but I'd like it to be more firm. Any suggestions?
5553	706	By far this is the  best jam I’ve made. I doubled the recipe with a combination of both green and ripe Hayden mangoes from Belize.  I added 1/2 cup lime juice  and threw in the squeezed limes  for extra pectin while the jam was cooking .  I added small diced pineapples and mangoes. I removed the limes when the jam was done cooking.
5554	707	So, I needed a quick recipe for fish tacos and found this one which seemed fairly quick and easy. I had beer battered fish fillets on hand and squeezed the lemon juice on them before putting them in the air fryer for 8-10 minutes. While those were cooking, I mixed up the dressing, however I only had apple cider vinegar so I used that instead of the red wine vinegar. I had a full container of mango salsa from Aldi that had pretty much all of the ingredients called for in this recipe, so I dumped that in with a bag of sliced cabbage and mixed it all together with the dressing, which all seemed to be in the perfect proportions. I didn’t have time to let this marinate, so it was a bit tangy, but for dinner in a pinch, I think it tasted fine. I served the air fried fish fillets and slaw on white corn tortillas topped with cilantro and a squeeze of lime, and got compliments on the meal from my husband and older kids and my daughter thanked me for making such a “yummy dinner”. I realize I made quite a few modifications, but I think my ingredients were still close enough to the original to write a review and thought it might be helpful to anyone else who may need/want to sub certain things as I did. I gave it 5 stars because I didn’t think it was fair to give any less if I didn’t follow the recipe exactly, but with my substitutions I would give it a 4/5 and will probably make this quick, easy, and tasty recipe again :)
5555	707	This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I made it just as written and I highly recommend you make the slaw in advance so all the ingredients can meld. I think people complaining of too much sugar, salt or vinegar did not let it sit in the frig for a while (which is important for any coleslaw).  I used a bag of slaw.  Excellent easy dinner!!
5556	707	Too much black pepper!!
5557	707	They were amazing!! I maybe got lucky and got mix right but on a day when it was 91 degrees outside it was a nice light meal with cool fruit and it was a great way to finish off the Alaskan cod I had made the day before.. we will be making this again! Thank you for the share
5558	707	A bit too much pepper for us, I did not add jalapeños, but the fruit and fish was great, I almost doubled the fruit and we really liked it.
5559	707	It was fabulous! I made it with shrimp I had in freezer. Even my son loved it and he’s picky! I will definitely make it again and try the fish next time!!!
5560	707	Definitely will make again.
5561	707	Awesome! Will do a little less black pepper next time, but other than that, no changes.
5562	707	Sweet and spicy, very good
5563	708	Amazing ! The Mango sauce was my favorite part! I will cook the inside and add rice on the side to make a main dish. My ten year old loved it!
5564	708	Egg rolls were delicious! The mango habanero sauce was good as well, but once the sauce cooled down the heat from the habanero had lessened alot, so next time I'll use 3 peppers instead of two.
5565	709	Flavors did not really meld
5566	709	Tasted amazing! I changed the ginger cookies for Maria cookies and I altered the amount of lime juice and zest because I wanted a bit more of the taste but absolutely amazing.
5567	709	Perfect recipe, tasted so good everyone enjoyed it!!!
5568	709	Made this for my Mexican BF for his birthday and he loved it. Lol.
5569	709	If you want tropical, creamy, dreamy goodness, you will not be disappointed!!  Follow the recipe.  It's amazing!  I made one slight change and made pineapple coulis simply because I couldn't find any mango.  It paired with the cheesecake and coconut whipped cream amazingly well.   I will be making this again and again every time I want to be transported back to the islands.
5570	709	This is a fabulous, fresh, and different dessert! Just perfect for a warm weather treat. For those hung up on debating whether or not it's a legit 'cheesecake' or not, please unknot your panties and just enjoy it. What does it matter?? Good grief. I followed the recipe to the letter and the result was just lovely. Of course, I'm an experienced baker and cook. If your results are inferior, don't worry! Just keep trying! Because inexperience which produces inferior results will fade over time, as experience level rises ;)
5571	709	My husband specifically asks for Cheesecake on his birthday. It happens overnight and came out so perfect!
5572	709	I made a few changes after reading the reviews.  Made the filling 1 1/2 times to increase the volume, tinted the lime layer with 1 drop of coloring, added a bit more zest and juice to increase the lime flavor and more coconut extract into the other layer.  I also made coconut whipped cream, toasted coconut and lime zest for the topping.  This was not a pretty dessert however, the hint of green in the first layer, mixed with it's natural color, made it look like a dirty scrambled egg cake when you cut into it.  Even with my changes, I also have to agree that the flavor was weak throughout.  I wanted more tropical flavor than what I got.
5646	718	Fabulously healthy , quick and easy. Since finding this recipe I've been making it every day for my kids' breakfast.  I use almond milk and   switch out the fruit every day so these little pots always harbor a surprise in the morning :-)
5573	709	After reading some complaints about thickness of the cheesecake,  I've doubled filling amount.  In 9 inch springform total thickness after baking is 1.5 inches.  I've followed the recipe and added water bath -  cheesecake turned out beautifully,  no cracking. It has creamy consistency,  not dense like New York style cheesecake. Overall,  I'm very pleased.
5574	710	Absolutely love it. Gave some away as a gift in nice jars. Thankyou
5575	710	I made this just as it is & it was delish.
5576	710	This recipe was so easy!  One thing I did to make sure it was nice and creamy was to put it in my blender on low for just a few seconds. It puréed it nicely. I also added a bit more brown sugar as it was pretty tart and I’m using as a dessert topping for guests tonight. I can’t for the life of me figure out why to lady who said she needed to add more water to reduce the mangoes had to do so. Mangoes have a good deal of natural juice, so adding more water would have made it soupy. I mashed the chunks of mangoes on the bottom of the sauce pan to help smooth it out while it was cooking. A good thing to do. I followed the ingredients exactly except for the brown sugar, and it turned out perfectly.
5577	710	Quick and easy and tased good on pancakes.  I used frozen mango which worked fine but was more difficult to mash, will  cook longer next time.  I put in pan with water and cooked on low until thawed then added other ingredients.  May add more water next time as there wasn't much liquid sauce.
5578	710	I did not make any changes to this recipe. I will definitely make again.
5579	710	This was a pleasant fruit sauce that wasn't very sweet to go with  my sweeter cakes.  I used the yellow skinned mangoes which isn't as stong flavoured/fragrant as the red/green skinned ones.  So I adjusted the tartness  to my taste and added a pinch of salt to bring out the flavour.  I did use a little cornstarch and water mixture to thicken the sauce more.
5580	710	This was a great way to quickly use up the mangoes that were getting away from me. A dollop of this, some fresh mango, fresh whipped cream, and angel food cake made for a great dessert!
5581	710	Great way to use up mangos that are getting too ripe. My sauce was a little thick when I went to use it so I just added a tiny bit of rum. I liked the result. Be warned if the mngos are truly ripe, this is very sweet. You could probably cut down on the sugar.
5582	710	Tasty!  I used twice as much brown sugar, twice as much OJ and probably an extra T of water.  It was quite thick without that.  Used it on Seth's pancakes to make them soft enough after surgery.
5583	711	yummy
5584	711	I added almond milk instead of regular milk. I definitely use this recipe everyday
5585	711	Instead of water an ice cubes I used frozen cherries and mangos and some unsweetened almond milk and unsweetened flaxseed milk with just enough water to get the consistency I wanted.
5586	711	I only had frozen fruit. No ice and added water until the right consistency. If I had fresh, ripe mangoes this would be even better.
5587	711	I found this recipe to be very thick and I had to add more liquid just to blend it. With that said, I used coconut water with aloe vera instead of water and added nearly 2 cups and my smoothie was still on the thick side. I also added the juice from half of a lime and sprinkles unsweetened coconut on top.
5588	711	Nice, simple, fruity drink.  Very refreshing on a warm day.  I had some very ripe mango, and since I used frozen cherries (I always have those on hand), I omitted the ice.  I also added a dash of vanilla and after tasting, I added a squeeze of fresh lime.  I used less water...maybe half a cup or so.  Perfection, but since I like to play around with my food, I'll probably also add a slice of fresh ginger the next time...and there'll be a next time.  :)  This is perfect for frozen mangoes and cherries, too, and I keep my freezer stocked with those.  A new summer fave!
5589	711	Really good!  I got tired of pitting cherries so I had more mangoes than cherries.
5590	711	The nutritional breakdown on its own is enough for most of us to try this one.  I used frozen mango, so I did reduce the ice a little, and since I like smoothies a little on the thick side, reduced the water as well.  I must admit that I've developed a taste for smoothies with a little Greek yogurt, so as a personal taste preference, I will add about 1/3 cup vanilla Greek yogurt next time.  However, this is simply pure sweet fruitiness from a combination of perfectly-ripe summer fruit, and it gives you a real pop of vibrant flavor.  Very nice.
5591	712	I didn’t make the cream sauce because I made a pineapple mango salsa instead. I felt that the crust wasn’t crunchy enough with this recipe.  Maybe I processed the nuts too much or put in too much olive oil. The flavor was delicious so I might give this recipe another try and tweak the ingredients in the crust part.
5592	712	Made to spec, but used cod because there was no bass. Delicious!!
5593	712	I made this and we loved it!!  For the Mango sauce I used an very ripe yellow mango, half and half and skim milk ( basically because that is what I had in the house)  I followed another reviewers advise and added 1/4 tsp on vanilaa to the sauce.   Cod was on sale so I bought it!!  Chopped up the macadamia nuts and panko but left it chunky because that's how we like it.. Garlic powder, black pepper and parsley and mixed it all up in a ziplock.. Put it in a casserole dish with a little olive oil. Convection oven 400 degrees for 15 minutes..All we can say is wow!!
5594	712	This was delicious.  I agree with other reviewers about the macadamia nut topping...next time will do without it was well as puree the mango sauce so that it is smooth.
5595	712	This was great. I followed the recipe except for adding a dash of Asian chili paste to the mango sauce and pureeing as others suggested. I heated the mango sauce until boiling, let cool a bit, pureed in food processor, and returned to sauce pan on warm until needed. I had a fabulous piece of sea bass - about 12 ounces and 1 1/4 inches thick served two. Served over sautéed spinach with Sushi rice on the side. Can't wait to put leftover mango sauce on something - anything!
5596	712	Everything was perfect- loved the mango cream sauce and the Mac nuts were a nice touch. The only thing I'll do next time is use a cheaper fish like Orange Roughy or Mahi Mahi. The reason I say that, I used an expensive Chilean Sea Bass and the sauce and crust was a little over powering for that delicate fish. It was very good, just hid the fish flavor more than I'd have liked.
5597	712	We substituted the sea bass for mahi-mahi with excellent results - and the mahi-mahi (which I buy frozen) is so much cheaper - fear not, try and you will agree!
5598	712	I used Japanese bread crumbs mixed with my own seasonings and was very very good.  Happy cooking.
5599	712	Yum
5647	718	Made for my wife to grab and go in the morning.  It is easy to make. She says oats are to chewy may add more milk next time or a longer soak time in the refrigerator.
5648	719	Tastes great, but need to cut back on the sugar a little.
5600	713	ok, in all fairness I didn't really follow the recipe but rather used it for inspiration.  one of those nights where I look in the fridge and wonder what I'm going to do with some frozen haddock and some frozen shrimp.   oh, and no eggs.  Thawed the fish and shrimp, wetted with mayo. breaded with panko and coconut.  Seasoned with some jerk seasoning, baked with butter at 350.  Served with some mango salsa.  Came out well.
5601	713	It tasted great. I struggle with getting breading to stick so that affected the taste some but that is user error :)
5602	713	The salsa was great. Next time I think I will add more salt to the fish.
5603	713	My fussy husband loved this, as did I. A definite do over!
5604	713	This was amazing and so flavorful and filling! It all came together nicely and tasted yummy
5605	713	Loved it!  It was delicious and very healthy.  Nicer display than the picture.  It made quite a bit more of spice than required for the dish; however, I will be making it again soon and will have the spices ready to go.
5606	713	OMG!!! This salsa is AMAZING! I liked the fish batter too with all the spices. I made the spice muxture like it said but put all of it into my bread crums instead of just a tablespoon like it said. It was very flavorful, fresh, and islandy. It didn't take me but about 40 mins to prep and cook everything. I multi-tasked. I also reused leftover batter on shrinp! Super light summer fresh dish.
5607	713	I read some reviews, and coated the fish with flour first.  This was a "spur of the moment recipe.... so I didn't have some of the spices (ginger!)... but used what I had.  Totally omitted the mango salso... but it was delicious without it!
5608	713	I made a Dairy Free and Gluten Free recipe. Replace milk with almond or coconut milk. Replace panko breeding with Origen Natural Quinoa Puffs! Delicious! And add a great crunch! I also added more shredded coconut and coconut milk to side of rice.
5609	714	OMG this is so refreshing and delicious.
5610	714	Very good. We loved it.
5611	714	Excellent!
5612	715	Perfect wing sauce
5613	715	I can't eat hot-spicy type foods, so I used a home grown blonde bell pepper, with almost no discernable heat to it. Very tasty sauce. Will have to try it on chicken soon!
5614	715	A sweet & spicy delight. A good sauce for so much more than just wings! I will always have this on hand in the fridge.
5615	715	Will make again very good
5616	715	Love this. Wouldn’t change a thing.
5617	715	This sauce had awesome flavor would do it again but want enough of a kick, going to try 3 habeneros next time. Good recipe though
5618	715	No changes at all needed. This sauce is awesome!!!
5619	715	To sweet for us
5620	715	Just finished making this recipe, and it was better than expected. Only Substitutions I made were 3 Habaneros vs 2 that were called for, used ground ginger instead of fresh, added a tablespoon of tomato paste and a few red pepper flakes for color. Absolutely delicious. This will be made again.
5621	716	My husband really loved it
5622	716	I followed the recipes as as and it was delicious. My guests loved it so much. I will certainly will be doing it again.
5623	716	My wonderful husband made this for a birthday/dance party we were going to.  This was a HIT!  People woofed it down.  Great mix of flavors.  Used 1 t. of salt; 1 T would have been WAY too much!  Make this NOW!
5624	716	I reduced the salt to.1 teaspoon,  but otherwise followed the recipe.   This was good and a nice change from traditional guacamole.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!
5625	716	Ok, I didn't measure a thing, including the avocados, but darn this was good. The mango was still a little firm, but that only added to the chunkiness.
5626	716	Amazing! Only suggestion is less salt. We halved the salt and it was still too much ( and this is coming from a girl who lives salty). Wondering if maybe the recipe called for 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp. This is delicious though. The mango really adds something special.
5627	716	Made this as it was written and it's good but I felt as though it's too salty.  I'm going to the store today to buy another mango to hopefully even out the saltiness! It's still pretty good overall and would definitely make this again (just with less salt)!
5628	716	This recipe is amazing. I followed exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.
5629	716	So delicious! Brought this to a party and everyone couldn't get enough....including the toddlers! My hubby got into it too because he got to use his manly choppin skills when we were makin it. :) I added an extra mango because it was ripe and I didn't want it to go bad and it was still really great! Thank you for the recipe!
5630	717	July 2018 - Love this mango salsa. Put over hamburger instead of using a bun.
5631	717	July 2018 - Love this mango salsa. Put over hamburger instead of using a bun.
5632	717	Easy and delicious!
5633	717	Changing my diet to all fresh. This was an awesome, easy, flavorful addition. Boosted to baked chicken!! Looking for more like this!
5634	717	I used mint instead of the cilantro and served it with grilled pork chops seasoned with soy sauce and Montreal seasoning. Delicious!
5635	717	OH my goodness.  I had this last night with orange chicken and I was delicious. I used a whole red bell pepper and about five green onions to satisfy our tastes. Totally forgot the oil, however this was awesome!
5636	717	Great recipe!  I added fresh, seeded, jalepeno and it was perfect!
5637	717	Tastes Delicious!  I used agave nectar instead of honey because that was all I had.  I also added a little bit of ground ginger spice to it.
5638	717	This was Very tasty. The only thing I might do differently is next time I think I'll add some jalapeño or fresh ginger for some zing. :)
5639	718	Easy to make and super delicious!
5640	718	This is delicious! I’ve made this recipe 3 or 4 times now, and really enjoy the results.
5641	718	Easy and tasty. I used frozen mango chunks which worked well and were thawed by morning
5642	718	loved this! I had everything except the mango on hand, so instead I used some canned sliced peaches and it tasted great! will be a regular breakfast for myself and family from now on
5643	718	This was delicious!
5644	718	I love this recipe! I made a few changes because of my dietary restrictions. I used almond yogurt and I actually already had frozen mangos. I liked it with maple syrup (Québécoise here) or fresh dates to replace honey.
5645	718	Hated it!  I either made it wrong or I hate cold oatmeal. Maybe if it was granola. But I'm sure it was me?
5691	724	Yummy
5692	724	Delicious and I added cherries
5649	719	Great salad. I took it to a gathering and had rave reviews. I did add mixed dried berries. The dried cherries were my favorite in it.
5650	719	Made this with a combo of romaine and dandelion greens, red onion, and omitted sugar since not necessary with all the sweet fruit.  Added sunflower seeds, feta, bacon, and cilantro, black beans and quinoa to make it a full meal.  Delicious!
5651	719	I took the recommendations of other reviewers and used 50/50 balsamic to oil and I was very pleased with the results. I’ll make again.
5652	719	Great recipe! I added avacado and used EVOO instead of canola oil. Light and refreshing!
5653	719	Great recipe! I added avacado and used EVOO instead of canola oil. Light and refreshing!
5654	719	I nice and refreshing take on salad!
5655	719	This is a fantastic recipe that I scaled down for 2 - 4 servings.  I used spinach instead of salad greens.  Mixing 2T strawberry balsamic vinegar and 2T canola oil plus a teaspoon of sugar and a dash of salt in a jar, shaking well.  I used all the other items in smaller amount...3/4 quart sliced strawberries, 1/2 cubed mango,  one slice of red onion, quartered and separated, 1/2c dried cranberries and 3T sliced almonds.  Pour the dressing on right before serving.
5656	719	I made it in minutes and it was a winner in my family with kids and husband!  the sugar ingredient was great with kids who are picky eaters but I would substitute sugar added for 1 tablespoon at the most or use honey instead.  I also used raw kale instead of salad which was great because the juices from the fruit did not make it so soggy quickly.  it actually lasted as a midnight snack that same evening.  i also issued from onions instead of white and added cilantro be for fresh taste.  it's definitely something I will continue to make, thank you!
5657	720	I left out the yogurt for vegan,  and substituted frozen pineapple instead of the juice. Love this for breakfast!
5658	720	Great smoothie!    Refreshing!
5659	720	added chunk pineapple the second time and blended less , came out better than the first one...the added pineapple did the trick !!!
5660	720	great smoothie!!!!!!!  ;-)
5661	721	I have made this recipe for small groups of 10 to large groups of 100.  Always a hit.  Instead of using chipotle powder, I use canned chipotle peppers.  Coarsely chop a small can to cook with the pork in balsamic vinegar and water.  I also use several peppers when I puree the mango in the blender.  I also add a cup of Woody's BBQ concentrate to get a smokey taste to the sauce.  The canned chipotle peppers bring a nice hint of heat, which is countered with the mango and honey.  I also start adding the bbq sauce in small quantities so it will not overpower the mango bourbon base.
5662	721	This recipe is so good, everyone’s favourite. You can adjust the taste to suit your own & it will always turn out great.  I use extra mangos, cause why not?  A winner in our house.
5663	721	Wow this is excellent!  Very flavorful, so yummmmm!  I did add an extra tsp of honey.  I also had to make my own BBQ sauce because I don't eat sugar,
5664	721	I think the recipe is okay. To me I would add less bar b que sauce because it overpowered the mango and definitely add the honey. I had crusty rolls and made a  meal with this pulled pork recipe. I would definitely make this again but adjust the ingredients slightly.
5665	721	Excellent
5666	721	Tangy and sweet with a little bit of a zing.   Loved it.  I diced the mangos quite small then used a whisk to blend the honey and bourbon until it was soupy.  Kept the mangos a bit "chunky" because I happen to love mangos. Substituted ground Cayenne Pepper and Chili powder instead of the Chipolte.
5667	721	love this recipe, great flavor and easy to make. family favorite now.
5668	721	This recipe is amazing!!! I’ve never gotten so many compliments on something I made. Definitely try this!!!
5669	721	I didn’t have fresh mango but had some I canned.  Worked great. Very tasty.  As my friend  said though not a first date dinner.  Really messy to eat.  Yum
5670	722	Absolutely loved this main dish salad!  It is perfect for a hot summer day.  The flavors are crisp and bright with just the right amount of heat.  I prefer Romaine lettuce for crunch.  I used Frank’s Red Hot sweet chili sauce because that is what I had on hand.  Served it with tostadas for a bit of crunch.  This is definitely a keeper!
5671	722	You do need to take care to find both perfectly ripe avacados and perfectly ripe mangos.  If you can find both at the same time, this salad is heavenly.  My teenage son would eat this  every day if he could.
5672	722	1/2 cup chili garlic sauce way too much spice . Cut in half or use more sugar or add honey .  Otherwise really good and can add snow peas too
5673	722	Was really yummy, a little on the spicy side. Used a rotisserie chicken and added extra avo, cuz I luuuv it! Will make again!
5674	722	Easy, healthy, tasty and I love i
5675	722	Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe called for other than reducing quantities to serve just 3 of us. Hearty, filling and amazing flavours! I'll make it a regular in our kitchen and won't change a thing
5676	722	Very good but the dressing is VERY spicy.  I bought the chip garlic sauce in the asian section. The degree of spiciness over powers the other flavors. Will make again but less chili sauce.  Thank goodness I tasted the dressing ahead of time and didn't pour the entire amount on the salad, it would have been inedible.  As a gage, when at a Thai restaraunt  I order my food mild.
5677	722	I USED 2T MANGO CHUTNEY INSTEAD OF THE BROWN SUGAR. TOOK IT TO MY BOOK CLUB FOR OUR LUNCH & IT WAS A HIT. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN
5678	722	Another Favorite
5679	723	i have made these for years but have never used pineapple juice or orange juice i like it better without them
5680	723	Followed the recipe, upped the rum and added pineapple slices to the blender.
5681	723	Really refreshing and creamy. We liked the cream of coconut, even though my husband isn’t usually a coconut fan.
5682	723	Excellent.  I added just a tiny bit of grenadine syrup because we like sweet.
5683	723	I love coconut, so I Love this drink.
5684	723	This was so good I made a few more servings. I added a little extra rum & curacao only because one person I made it for wanted a little stronger. Otherwise, this was perfect .....
5685	723	I made this last summer. Perfect as is, I changed nothing.
5686	723	Really great. I will definitely be making this again
5687	723	Great balance of flavors.
5688	724	it took 2 hours to thicken the glaze , by then the ham was done we used tons of brown sugar added honey and syrup , cornstartch  nothing really helped
5689	724	Awesome 👌
5690	724	This made a perfect Easter dinner!
5693	724	Glaze was delicious - once I got it to thicken! After 15 minutes in the microwave, I gave up and mixed a tablespoon of cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water, whisked until smooth, added to the glaze, and microwaved for one minute on high. Worked like a charm. Two tablespoons of cornstarch would be better - my glaze was a little runny still. I skipped the fresh pineapple entirely, and dropped apple halves in the bottom of the pan halfway through cooking instead. They were delicious. I'll cover the ham with aluminum foil during cooking next time, it was a little dry.
5694	724	We rarely eat ham but this made for a tasty Easter treat!  I used canned crushed pineapple with the brown sugar instead of rings.  We thought it turned out great!
5695	724	Had good flavor and easy to make!
5696	724	Made this a few moneys back and we really enjoyed the taste of it Thanks
5697	725	this punch tastes good! i recommend it! there’s no strong alcohol taste at all, it’s enjoyable, and super dangerous. hahaha. be careful! it’s easy to drink a lot of it.
5698	725	Pretty good. Added some pimento for more flavor
5699	725	Reminds me of a cousin to the Mai Tai. I also doubled the coconut rum but still did not detect any of that flavoring.
5700	725	Added a pinch more of grenadine other than that it was delicious
5701	725	Yumo! Made exactly except subbed regular Bacardi for 151. Real hit for a day on the lake.
5702	725	I did not change anything and I would make it again.
5703	725	very easy and it was a hit
5704	725	So good! Made me feel like I was right back on the beach in Negril. I took the advice of other reviewers and used regular white rum in place of the 151....but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I even made a rum free batch for the kids and they loved it! Perfect paired with jerk marinated chicken and Caribbean rice & beans. Will definitely be making again!
5705	725	Best rum punch hands down. Everyone loves it.
5706	726	My whole family loves this sauce.  I do add a little more whiskey, that's just my way.
5707	726	This recipe is great, everyone loved it. Very close to the original, only a little better!!! I didn't make any changes but will try with garlic powder - 1 tablespoon.
5708	726	DELICIOUS!  But I will decrease the cayenne next time. Yummy!
5709	726	Great sauce!! Everyone loves it! Instead of steps 1-3 and 5, I added a teaspoon of dried minced garlic in Step 6.
5710	726	I made it as it says but it came out very thin, how do I thicken it?
5711	726	I didn't use Jack Daniels I used his brother Jim with honey . I also use turiva brown sugar I have made it with regular brown sugar but we like to keep the sugar intake down . And I use store bought minced onion 2 teaspoons and red onion but I only put 1 tablespoon of onion . Then when done I use my bullet to puree more to get the chunks out and my family uses it as a sauce for chicken wings they love it . 4 stars because I think it's to much onion and just use already minced garlic
5712	726	Excellent recipe. Exact in flavor and delicious. Does take a while to make but baking the garlic is the biggest part
5713	726	I used Jim  bean with honey and Truvia brown sugar to make it lower in sugar and carbs turns out great everyone loves it
5714	726	Love this sauce but would like to make a large batch and can it for future. Can I use the Water bath method or do I need to pressure can?
5715	727	I have been making this for at least 35 years it has been a favorite , we called it Mexican Wedding Cake. I am making it for Easter.
5716	727	I made this cake for a picnic last year and it was excellent. Makes a very moist wonderful cake
5717	727	I am sorry, I normally do not comment, but felt like I had to this time.  This was my first attempt at pineapple cake, I had a fresh pineapple and thought I would make something with it.  I won't do that again to a fresh pineapple.  This is not like normal cake, might have been good as a loaf bread maybe.  It does look like this image in the video.
5718	727	I'm really happy I came across this recipe.  However, I made this with pancake mix to use up the big bag I got at Costco.2 cups of Krusteaz pancake mix.1/4 cup of sugar because there is already sugar in pancake mix.Skipped the baking soda because there was already leavening agent in pancake mix.1/4 of melted butter added to batter and mixed it in; this just added a bit more fatty moisture to the cake.  I tried it without at first but thought it was missing some butteryness.Then added coconut flavoring to the cream cheese icing with shredded coconut on top. Turned it into a kind of pina colada cake.
5719	727	these where really good instead of a cake a made them into a cupcake so good!
5720	727	I made the cake exactly like the recipe. I did not modify or add anything to it. The cake required more cook time in my oven, but that’s not a big deal, I just kept checking it every 5 minutes. It is a sticky cake, but came out of the pan without falling apart. Was moist enough. Loved it! I added shredded coconut and maraschino cherry juice to the frosting along with extra sugar to make a larger amount so I could frost bother layers. It was fantastic. So easy to make. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!!!
5721	727	Husband and I love this. It’s really easy to make. Only thing I changed was more powder sugar. He loves thick frosting. Plus my cake was so moist the very top chips off a tiny bit. Adding more powder sugar gave more frosting to camouflage the crumbs.
5722	727	Didn't have crushed pineapple, only tidbits, so ran them through a blender.  45 mins in my oven and it wasn't even half baked.  Took another 15 mins.  Overall came out spongy but really rubbery and it's as dark as pumpkin bread.  Tastes good though.Added shredded coconut and half a 2nd can of pineapple to the icing.  Also tasted good.
5723	727	Came out great. Very easy directions to follow. Thank you.
5724	309	I’ve been making frog eyed salad for a long time now, I agree w above user it’s fun to see all the different renditions. Reading this, I am blown away how one can use an entire 16oz of acini de pepe 40oz of cannned pineapple, 33 oz of mandarin oranges, all the other ingredients & serve 10!? I had to take out one heaping cup of noodles & it was still over powering on the noodles. I also add strawberry, fresh pineapple, maraschino, cherries, & I only ever use the white marshmallows because I want the fruit & noodles to be the star of the show. Came here for measurement recommendations- regretted it lol. Well now I have some in the freezer hoping to thaw out for next time.
5725	309	I could eat this every day!
5726	309	I've made this several times. I made as directed and also used vanilla pudding in place of the other ingredients. Both ways are good. Just for fun I add some halved grapes making it look a little more like " frog eyes.
5768	732	This drink tastes JUST like a piece of cake! I found the Three Olives cake vodka at my local Total Wine and More. It’s delish!
5727	309	I've always loved frog eye salad. It makes a lot and is  real crowd pleaser. I refrigerate the fruit ahead of time, make the pasta and custard and refrigerate together over night. Then I combine with the fruit and marshmallows (colored ones are fun), and I also add green grapes!
5728	309	Family favorite.  I used less sugar, only pineapple chunks or tidbits, fruit cocktail, and tropical fruit.  I change it up every time.
5729	309	I used strawberrys
5730	309	Love this recipe.  Seemed like an ordeal when I first read the recipe, but it is really not bad!  You can even cook the pasta ahead and rinse it very well with cold water and store in frig, then loosen it up with a fork so it is not clumped and make the lemon sauce when you are ready!  Be sure to add the marshmallows last minute and it keeps a few days in the frig!
5731	309	I made it exactly as the recipe is written, and it seems too heavy on the pasta, acini de pepe. I doubled the amount of Cool Whip and added more marshmallows. This was a little closer to the frog eye salad I remember from years ago. If I made it again, I would cut the pasta almost in half.
5732	309	I make this salad for holidays and it is enjoyed by my family.  I leave out the marshmallows and sprinkle the coconut on top of individual servings to accommodate personal tastes.
5733	729	Super easy to follow and make! Thank you! They came out perfect! Fluffy, slightly crispy and definitely sweet!
5734	729	too much juice- I'll know better if there's a next time. Still tastes good tho. Look pathetic
5735	729	I used my own vanilla cupcake recipe and just added the juice from the tinned pineapples so the inspiration was great! Thanks 😊
5736	729	Really liked how simple it was to make. I think next time I would drain off the juice from the crushed pineapple or use little pineapple tidbits instead! Will for sure make this again! Yum!
5737	729	OK
5738	729	Loved  it made it with fresh pineapple from my  neighbors yard. The whole neighborhood wanted the recipe.  Especially the under thirty crowd,,,,!,,!!    Sorry no pictures they went that fast!!
5739	729	Easy to make, very good!
5740	729	I couldn't find crushed pineapple, so I used chunks and just broke them up myself. I used the juice from that can of pineapples and added maraschino cherry juice to make it equal the 1 1/3c that the recipe called for. They came out perfectly! I'm sure they will be a hit at the Luau today.
5741	729	I was worried they wouldnt come out of the tin but they came right out!!!  came out great!!  next time i think I will half the cherries!  I had a 15oz can of crushed pineapple, next time I will make sure it's a 20oz can!
5742	730	Usually serve it alongside barbecued ribs.
5743	730	so good it is delicious amazing
5744	730	I smoked ours for about 1 hour at 200 degrees with wild cherry on the second go. I will say the one I smoked is talked about more by neighbors and family I have shared this recipe with.
5745	730	I did add a 1/2 tsp of ginger and 2 TBSP of Butter to the recipe. I did not grill the pineapple. I baked it at 350°F for 20 minutes. The results was astounding. I personally do not care for pineapple. But I made it as a request from my son. I tried it myself, and it was like eating warm, apple pie. I enjoyed it.
5746	730	Oh so delicious as written. Cut spears thinking it would go with a scoop of ice cream. But couldn’t wait to taste and as it turned out it was the perfect compliment for shrimp and steak. Next time with pork...
5747	730	Baked fresh pineapple at 375F. 30 minutes.  Delicious.
5748	730	Loved this...it was so good!  Marinaded the pineapple for a couple of hours in the bag, then grilled on medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.  I turned the pineapple every couple of minutes.  It was delicious!
5749	730	My guests couldn't stop raving about this -- so simple, and so delicious!
5750	730	Delicious treat. Highly recommend for any BBQ.
5751	731	everyone loved it!!
5752	731	My husband's favorite ham recipe!
5753	731	Definitely recommend. I did a smaller ham so I just followed the cooking instructions it came with on the spiral ham, so I did a 9lb for 2 hours. I kept basting in between every 30min-1hour. It came out absolutely delicious. I also couldn’t find these cherries so I used regular cherries at my super market. I also used lemon juice in a 4.5oz bottle instead of recommended on recipe. Also used minced instead of whole cloves. Would do this recipe again. Came out great.
5754	731	My whole family loved this Ham so much, they requested it for Christmas Dinner. This recipe was delicious. Highly recommend.
5755	731	Was Excellent and a Family New Favorite
5756	731	i love it is asome
5757	731	Used the changes in Mimi's review, fabulous and easy peasy.  mimi02/25/2009This is almost the exact recipe I use for my Easter and Christmas Ham. I decorate the ham the exact way as called for in this recipe. I use 2 cups brown sugar Preferably dark brown, Enough of the pineapple juice to make a wet sand consistancy, I add about a 1/4 cup of yellow mustard, 1 teaspoon ground cloves, and pour over ham then pour the rest of pineapple juice in pan and seal it with foil. I bake at 325 for 2 hours completely covered and then for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees, I baste with the juices from the bottom of pan every 5 minutes. If you completely seal the ham in the beginning, you will never have dried up juices. This is for an 8 lb or so ham. For a 12 lb ham, I would bake sealed for about 3 or 4 hours sealed and then the same for the last 15 minutes. I also thicken the juices at the end with a flour and water mix. My ham and sweet gravy has always been the talk of the dinner. My granddaughter always requests it during the holidays.
5758	731	Wonderful recipe
5759	731	Excellent Ham!  Careful the brown sugar doesn’t burn on you. I’ve made this ham multiple times now. It’s a keeper!!
5760	732	My Lady Absolutely loved it.
5761	732	This drink is so good, but to make it even better,  I like to add  to add a tablespoon or 2 of sweetened condensed milk. YUMMY!
5762	732	I'm going to make this drink right now!!
5763	732	Sooo delish!!!! Omg I can’t get enough!! Must try!! Used whipped vodka and extra cherry juice!!
5764	732	I absolutely love this drink. In the past I had used vanilla vodka, which worked fine, but the cake flavor really does make it better. It's a really great, easy-to-drink cocktail :-)
5765	732	delicious and yes ill make it again
5766	732	Bam! Nice drink. Smooth and delicious
5767	732	Cake flavored vodka is what makes this drink!! This recipe is 100% my favorite drink, ever. I swear you can *taste* the crust of the cake when you drink this. Pure heaven.
5910	750	Soa easy to make. I used store bought dough. Instead of milk and sugar I used egg yolk and sugar. Beautiful color and taste.
5769	606	Great recipe! It is delicious. I have had it in the morning as a regular smoothie and have also added vanilla vodka to it for an evening cocktail.
5770	606	really good!, i dont know if this is bad, but i did put some homeade iced foam into it, the two mixed together kind of clash, but the smoothie itself is amazing!!!
5771	606	Only different thing I did was add coconut water ( my pineapples were already in the jar with it ). Super easy, great taste. Thank You
5772	606	This is scrumptious! However, it has far too much sugar for my low sugar diet.
5773	606	Couldn't be any easier! Delish!
5774	606	This was awesome I will definitely try this again! I had BLTs for dinner and this smoothie it was awesome!
5775	606	I think this is an ok recipe. I didn't hate it but I didn't think it was super wow. This is good for helping with weight loss if needed.
5776	606	Very refreshing on a hot, summer day!
5777	606	It was great! A good way to use up pineapple. very different from the usual strawberry and banana smoothie.
5778	734	The recipe is  very good, my familyloved it. I doubled it and made one change. I used 5 slices of white bread and 5 slices of maple and brown sugar bread.
5779	734	This is so good. Whenever I get together with my family or in-laws, I'm always asked to make it. It's like a dessert with dinner. Some may find it a tad to sweet. If this is the case just decrease sugar amount. It's also best to use bread that's a few days old (it's easier to cut in). When I make it, I always make a double batch regardless of how many people as most go back for more.
5780	734	Everyone loved it! I used Keto Bread and 1/2 cup lite brown sugar and 1/2 cup monk fruit sweetener. Next time I will really let the butter soften. And I used the crushed pineapple and added half can of chunk pineapple. Very, very good!
5781	734	I make this stuffing per the recipe. Always in demand on Thanksgiving! It is definitely sweet but my family and friends love it as is! My mom had the same recipe and it was always a fave growing up! Thank you Allrecipes for having this recipe available as I misplaced my mom’s. ❤️
5782	734	I’ve been making this recipe for years and everyone enjoys it.  For the bread, I use 6 slices of Italian bread because it holds up better than regular white bread.  Once the egg and sugar mixture is well beaten, stir in the drained pineapple and then gently fold in the bread cubes.  If using a glass baking dish, remember to lower the oven temperature by 25 degrees.  Enjoy!
5783	734	This recipe is great but I cut the sugar from 1 cup to a 1/2 C .... One time I made it omitting the sugar completely and no one even noticed !
5784	734	I used brown sugar instead of white but that was the only change. This stuffing is so good, it's almost a dessert!
5785	734	This is a great side dish. I made this to take to a covered dish dinner and it was a hit.  There was nothing left over to take home.  I am grateful for the Allrecipes website!!  Thank you!
5786	734	I made it to go with the leftover New Year's ham. It was a  big hit.
5787	735	I’m shocked no one has commented on the obviously incorrect 1/4 tsp. of honey. You should use more like 1/4 cup! That’s what similar recipes I’ve found online use.
5788	735	Tried it after a trip to Hawaii…Ditched the hot sauce for tajin! Amazing
5789	735	Made as directed the first time but couldn’t really taste the ingredients. Made it again and added 3T honey and 4T of Frank’s Hot Sauce. Left out salt as the butter was salted. Much better. It’s how I make it now. It’s like buffalo pineapple instead of wings.
5790	735	Made it using 1/2 teaspoon of New Mexico red chili instead of dash of Tabasco. Delish!
5791	735	Delicious
5792	735	This recipe is amazing.  My new favorite way to eat pineapple.
5793	735	Interesting taste. Not too bad, could be sweeter. Will try again.
5794	735	Nice change from potatoes and corn when paired with pork chops.
5795	735	Made the fruit exactly as written, except for cutting in thin wedges instead of rings (and used the whole pineapple instead of wasting the core). Did not add ice cream. Served with sesame-ginger-miso grilled salmon, roasted broccoli, and fried rice. 3 adults inhaled the pineapple, & asked if there was more. I didn’t even get to taste it!
5796	736	Thanks for sharing this recipe which is delicious. Next time I may add some nuts and coconut.
5797	736	OMG it is to die for.
5798	736	It’s an absolutely delicious recipe and everyone I’ve made it for loves it. However I reduce the sugar by half and use 3/4 of the flour required, replacing 1/4 cup or the flour with desiccated coconut to give it a delicious coconut chewy flavor. Serve hot with icecream and boom! Exposing tastebuds guaranteed
5799	736	I made this with a few changes.1) I used pineapple chunks and tossed them with some brown sugar (they were more on the tart side) and some cornstarch (to thicken up any remaining liquid after draining)2) instead of pouring melted butter on top I chopped some butter and then dotted the top.Everything else was the same. The kids really dug it, would absolutely make again. I really liked the texture of the crust
5800	736	So good!  Will be baking this again.  A few tweaks, I used a long casserole dish since I had so much pineapple, 1/2 stick of chopped cold butter and sprinkled a little bit of oats on top before baking.  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!
5801	736	This recipe is perfect! Made it for a dinner party and the guests loved it. It was all gone in few minutes. The only change I made was substituting 1 cup flour for 1/2 cup of flour and  1/2 cup oats.
5802	736	My husband and I loved this..wonderful with vanilla ice cream or cool whip
5866	744	This was delicious!  I used chunky apple sauce instead of pineapple (because it's what I had on hand)  and added pecans!  I will definitely make it again, and I'll try pineapple next time.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!
5867	744	Made it exactly by recipe, was great!
5868	744	I made w gluten free bread and everyone loved it
5869	744	Didn't add nutmeg.  A little less sugar
5870	744	Loved it made it and added vanilla to mines and I ate it with some stew pork, so good.
5871	157	A tasty and functioning recipe. Nice cake. After reading reviews I used my 12" Calphalon skillet which worked well. For me, it was cloyingly sweet. I will try again sometime cutting sugar in the batter by 1/3 and topping butter and sugar by one half.
5872	157	This recipe was great!  Using a 10" cast iron skillet I would reduce the butter and sugar slightly.  Using the recipe as is in a 12" cast iron skillet would have been perfect.  Next time I'll try separating the eggs first and add whipped egg whites in at the end for more fluff.
5984	758	Delicious!
5803	736	Pineapple, I love pineapple! I made this with one fresh pineapple. This was easy to make and tastes delicious. I already had everything In my cupboards to make this which made it so simple. Well except an egg but what crazy person doesn’t have eggs. I was actually at the store yesterday and thought to myself  “hmm I should get eggs” but decided I would wait since we don’t eat eggs very often. But I did get me a pineapple because, well you know, I said it at the beginning of my review.  I guess not getting eggs was a mistake because as I was checking out allrecipes.com I found this gem of a recipe. Luckily I have a non crazy  neighbor that was able to provide the one measly egg needed for this recipe. No running to the store which was nice. Although running the store would have been a good idea so I could burn some of the calories I consumed eating this delicious dessert. Honestly though I’m not sure the egg was needed. Im thinking I could have just cut the butter in the flour/sugar mixture and it would have worked out. Eh regardless it was still good and I would make it as written again. Well Except maybe less butter. I think the butter could probably be reduced without anyone knowing the difference. I don’t know about you but I could do with fewer calories. I think this would be great with apples or peaches as well.  Now I’m off to provide my lovely neighbor with a bowl of this deliciousness for making it possibly for me to enjoy this delightful dessert on my lunch break.
5804	736	I made this recipe because I had some fresh pineapple in my fridge. I also put some coconut with the pineapple and made it in a loaf baking pan. It tastes delicious I hope my boy friend loves it or at least enjoys. It’s an easy and quick recipe to make. I will be making ut for my mom next time.
5805	737	I add about a cup of shredded coconut to the batter. Always a hit!
5806	737	I have been making this exact recipe for about 15 years.  It is great and it has been a hit everytime I have made it.  For the person wondering about using other fruit the answer is yes.  I found strawberries packed in juice at a dollar store.  My granddaughter said she would love it if she could have it in a strawberry flavor so I tried it.  Worked great.  The strawberries were whole so I sliced them up.
5807	737	Yummy
5808	737	Used Duncan Hines mix adding 20 oz pineapple juice instead of water, electric mixer 2 minutes, then folded in pineapple and 1/2 cup coconut, baked in 9.75 inch Bundt pan 35 min on bottom rack, turned oven off last couple minutes, cooled upside down at least an hour. Frosted when completely cool. Very fluffly, moist and amazing, everyone liked it. Will surely make again, might try a sheet cake version.
5809	737	It was amazing but would like to know if you could use other fruit instead of pineapple?
5810	737	Light and tasty. Disappered in minutes.
5811	737	Such a good light desert and so easy.
5812	737	made a couple of modifications, 1/2 cupmandrine oranges crushed in place of 1/2 cup of the pineapple and 1/2 cup coconut. Everyone LOVED it
5813	737	This was absolutely delicious. I will make it again and again.   This was so easy to make and I loved it.
5814	738	Amazing! Easy to make and delicious! 😋
5815	738	Super easy and would make again.  I used fresh pineapple and wished I had more liquid.  I added fresh ginger and garlic. I gave this 4 stars when it was fresh but after sitting in the fridge for a day it became 5 stars.  Delicious!!!
5816	738	East  peasy and delicious.
5817	738	Excellent dish and easy to make. Will consider serving over saffron rice next time.
5818	738	I love how simple and easy the recipe is; but it was a little bland to me. It was super easy to modify it to my tastes though - I added some garlic, ginger, pepper, and brown sugar! Then ate the chicken with white rice! Loved it.
5819	738	Added 1/4 cup brown sugar at end. Was a touch boring without. Now a favorite!
5820	738	Such a good recipe! I used fresh pineapple and just juiced it. I also added half a teaspoon garlic powder and onion powder and very little veggie broth to the raw bell pepper and raw broccoli to cook it quicker.As everything was simmering I added some honey as my pineapple wasn't very sweet. And didn't use cornstarch cause I had none.Turned out great!
5821	738	My family and I loved this!! Very easy to make and very delicious!! Will make again.
5822	738	Just 1 pot…it is Easy!
5823	739	Easy to make and fantastic!
5824	739	It was really good.  I Like this recipe.
5825	739	It’s good enough, but it doesn’t taste anywhere near as good as my mother’s.
5826	739	This is a time consuming recipe not worth the effort.  It looks pretty at first but as time goes on the maraschino cherries bleed into the pineapple and the cake which gives off a horrible alcohol taste.  If you still want to make the cake, leave those cherries out!  The cake itself is not moist and just ok.  I wouldn't waste my time or ingredients to make this again.
5827	739	I used Krusteaz gluten free flour and it worked just as well!
5828	739	It was so easy. For my son's birthday as its his favorite.
5829	739	Easy, turned out great
5830	739	Not sure why some folks had so much trouble with this recipe. Mine came out just fine although it took about 15 minutes longer to bake. I added a couple tablespoons of Grand Marnier  on top of the brown sugar, butter, pineapple & cherries. It was DELICIOUS!!
5831	739	the best!
5832	740	Good! Would be better without Benedictine
5833	740	I've looked all over for YEARS for the recipe for a Singapore Sling.  I was so pleased to run into this one while browsing the allrecipes site.....one of my favorite pastimes!   Will be making these wonderful fruity/sweet-tart drinks soon!  Thank you Home Happy hour
5834	740	Your mouth will do the jetter bug with this nicely chilled drink in it !!! the fresh pineapple is a great touch to it ! But I also used the juice from the fresh pineapple instead of can pineapple juice, and that really made a huge differance. Go ahead and let your mouth do the jetter bug!   ^..^
5835	156	Change nothing! This recipe is exactly as it should be.
5836	156	I loved it. My first time baking a cake since a highschool classroom, over 25 years ago, and I'll definitely be baking more. I followed the directions as is, and it came out great. The only difference I did, the store didn't have yellow cake mix, so I used white. For the pudding mix, I used lemon. Again, I loved it, and thank you for the recipe.
5837	156	Perfect 🍰 CakeNothing but praise 🙌🏾🥰
5873	157	This is the recipe I use for my son- in -law's birthday cake. He loves pineapple upside down cake. My daughter who professes not to like  pineapple upside down cake, even loves this one. I can't imagine how many tries it takes to develop and perfect a winning recipe that works so well and I wouldn't think of changing one ingredient, or measurement making this cake.  Well done!
5838	156	I tried to follow this recipe as written as so many said that they did and it turned out wonderful.  First, the recipe calls for an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings. It appears by most photos that everyone used a larger can by how many pineapple rings are on their cakes.  I could not find an 8 oz. can of pineapple rings so purchased a Dole 20 oz. can (in heavy syrup) and measured out what would be 8 oz. which turned out to be 4 pineapple rings and about 1/3 cup of juice. (That kinda makes no sense because now I needed 2/3 cup of milk and she calls for 1/4 cup or as needed - this seems like a big leap but that's ok - I did use 2/3 cup of milk to bring that to 1 cup). I did decide to use another couple of pineapple rings from the  can because it looked too sparse just using 4 which didn't seem to make any difference in the end anyway. Secondly, the recipe calls for an 18.25 oz boxed yellow cake mix.  What I found was 15.25 oz. Betty Crocker yellow cake mix. Could this be the reason why so many cakes are coming up with too much moisture?  Maybe. Thirdly, like many others at 40 minutes a wooden skewer showed that my cake was still not baked through.  I left it another 10 minutes (a total of 50 minutes) and then it was done perfectly.  Making those changes though - made an absolutely terrific Pineapple Upside-Down Bundt® Cake! Couldn't give it the 5 stars I wanted to for all of the diversions I had to make to the original recipe buts it was 5 stars after my changes.  I hope that helps some others!
5839	156	This was great! Easy! I cooked it for 40 minutes @350°    I substituted raspberries for the cherries. I did find that letting it sit for about an hour made the cake less fragile when I cut it. I also served homemade whipped cream on top with 4-5 fresh raspberries on the side.
5840	156	A couple of notes about this recipe; first the baking time is off, most bundt cakes need at least an hour of bake time. Second, I think the amount of butter for the topping needs to be reduced, maybe 1/4 cup would work better as this is not being baked in the traditional cast iron or 9x13 pan. I dried my pineapple and cherries before putting them in the pan. Hope this helps. I will definitely make it again, it’s delicious and look beautiful.
5841	156	Beautiful and delicious!  I think I'm going to use the same basic recipe and make a lemon upside down Bundt cake.  Love the caramelized butter/pineapple/cherries.  Made the cake look quite elegant.
5842	156	No just like recipe
5843	156	Awesome recipe. Delicious and super moist. It went fast! Will be making again for sure.
5844	742	AMAZING
5845	742	First of all, it's a simple recipe. I too used some frozen pineapple to enhance smoothie characteristics. Really enjoyed the taste; the cucumber, parsley, lemon and ginger adds an explosive summary to your taste buds.
5846	742	The recipe was simple enough to make and perfectly fit in my Ninjia 1500 watts blender using the single serve option. The recipe was so easy to follow.  It tastes really good!!
5847	742	This was the first time I ever made a smoothie and I followed all the ingredients and directions. It was really good and actually refreshing. Will keep this one as a favorite.
5848	742	I am enjoying this recipe. All the flavors balance each other out and the pineapple is perfect for this blend.
5849	742	Actually tastes really good! Didn’t know what to expect but the pineapple made the difference I think!
5850	742	I love it !!! I changed it a bit. I added tumeric, Cayenne pepper, honey. I didn't have cucumber or lemon so I left them out. Next time I will try spinach in it.
5851	742	Delicioussss! I changed it a bit, with the things I had on the fridge: no lemon, orange juice instead, half of coconut water and half of orange juice, added spinach instead of parsley...and thats it! My family  LOVED IT!
5852	742	I made it exactly as written, except I used a bit of lemonade since I didn't have any coconut water...it was great! even my kids drank it!
5853	743	I used fresh pineapple and some apple cider to replace the canned. It probably enhanced the meal a bit, but it was delicious with rice and an Asian cucumber salad.
5854	743	I'm sorry, but this recipe was a waste of time and ingredients. Neither my husband nor I liked it. He thought it was too acidy. The meatballs just didn't work for me in combination with pineapple. The flavors don't mesh well, and I am just not a fan of cooked pineapple.  Sadly, it was very much reminiscent of something I would have eaten in the 70's but I must have forgotten that I didn't like it then either.  We threw it out, and I won't be making it again.
5855	743	This tastes just like I remember from my childhood! My wife says it reminds her of tomato beef. Went to the store to get the ingredients for the recipe and forgot white vinegar so I used Rice Wine instead. I have no idea if it changed the taste or not but next time I will remember white vinegar and see how it turns out.
5856	743	Me and my family loved these meatballs. I had to double the recipe.
5857	743	My mom made these all the time but added a few bean sprouts and maraschino cherries.  My favorite.   Her’s was not sweet.  Wish I had that recipe to see the difference.
5858	743	This has always been a hit with one of the many meals I have made. No one has ever been disappointed. The difference is I cook mine in a slow cooker. Comes out awesome. And always served on Jasmine rice.As a matter of fact I will be making this for some friends visiting from S. Carolina that have never had it before, this Wednesday.
5859	743	Really great recipe, I doubled the garlic and ginger to the meatballs as well as adding more of the soy sauce and vinegar to the sauce and I used red and orange pepper instead of green. Used green onions for garnish; this dish will absolutely be made again!
5860	743	Easy to prepare, I added red onion, yellow and red bell peppers. It’s really delicious.
5861	743	I swapped out the brown sugar for Swerve brown sugar substitute. Still good! Will make this again.
5862	744	My family has been making this recipe for a long time and we always called it Baked Pineapple. I think, for us, the recipe came from a cookbook called Tidewater on the Halfshell. One difference for us is we melt the butter in a skillet and toast the cubed bread in the butter before adding to the pineapple/egg mixture. I think it makes a difference to have those toasty bits of bread. Delicious either way, though!
5863	744	I’ve made this many times before seeing this recipe however I’ve never added the cinnamon or nutmeg and don’t think I’ll try. I’ve always served as a dessert with Cool Whip or ice cream. It’s a hit at my house.
5864	744	I made this tonight as written except I only had rye bread. Everyone loved it. Next time I will cut the sugar to one-half cup. Thank you for the recipe
5865	744	I absolutely loved this.....rich, sweet and decadent! My wife didn’t like it as much as I!  This is truly more like a dessert  than a side item. Had it with ham and green beans for dinner followed by a large, warm  scopeful on Blue Bell homemade vanilla ice  cream for dessert! Mmmmm!
5874	157	Best pineapple upside down cake I ever made. Like baking in cast iron. Followed recipe exactly…. Let sit 10 minutes before flipping. Excellent, only recipe I’ll ever use….sold!
5875	157	It's great! The cake is light and fluffy like a box mix.I used maybe only 4 tbsp of butter instead of an entire stick for the bottom/top.I reduced the brown sugar to about a 1/2 cup instead of 1 and 1/2 cups and added 2 tsp of Jack Daniels.Reduced white sugar to 1.25 cups instead of 1.5.Used buttermilk to activate the 1 tsp of baking soda I substituted for 1 of 2 tsp of baking powder.Substituted 1 tsp of Jack Daniels for 1 of the 2 tsps of vanilla extract.
5876	157	num num
5877	157	This was delicious!  Based on the reviews about what pan size to use, I used a #8, my largest cast iron, and cut the recipe in half.  The pineapples fit beautifully in the #8.  As you can see from the photo, it ended up being a rather thin cake.  Next time I'm either going to try cutting the recipe in half again and using my #6 pan or doing the full recipe in my #8.  The only reason I rated this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 was because there's no pan size listed.
5878	157	This is the best pineapple upside down cake I've ever eaten.  Getting ready to make it again.
5879	157	Looks Great! Happy Birthday, Sally!!!
5880	746	I added shredded coconut. Delicious
5881	746	This is fantastic!!
5882	746	So I was really confused about this recipe, initially by the ingredients. I ended up trying it anyways because I was making some Hawaiian Shoyu Chicken for dinner, and wanted to make a Hawaiian dessert to go with it. Unfortunately this dish was just too weird, the marshmallows got really hard with the cold fruit and sour cream, I put a little bit of Jell-O at the base of my serving bowl and topped with Cool Whip. I will not be making this again.
5883	746	Good but I don’t quite know why it needs drained so much. I think it could benefit from the juice.
5884	746	Did not make any changes at all! It was refreshing and yummy and best of all, super easy to make. It does make a large amount .
5885	746	Always add shredded coconut and its incredible.
5886	746	i changed a couple of things but nothing huge or note worthy
5887	746	I have a GREAT TIP to make this salad much faster. For those of you that have a "Salad "Spinner....you can shave 3-4 hours off the prep time waiting for fruit to drain. I made a half recipe, so I was able to put all the fruit into my salad spinner and PRESTO!! Your fruit is ready to prepare right away!
5888	746	I made this for a party and everyone absolutely loved it! I added a box of orange jello as suggested in the comments and it was sooooo good! There were no leftovers and some of my guests were sad that it was all gone. Wonderful recipe!
5889	747	Thank you so much for the instruction on how to achieve smooth sauce using cornstarch; some may think it's a no-brainer but I did not know how. The sauce turned out great. Your recipe saved the day :)
5890	747	This is the closest to "the real thing" I've tasted. I added a splash more vinegar and soy and a drop or two of tabasco. A very good recipe indeed :-)
5891	747	I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder.Very flavorful.  Loved it!
5892	747	Such an easy recipe and superb taste. Thanks for sharing!
5893	747	It's good! I think the cornstarch makes it chalky though. I use pineapple chunks without juice and just cook it down a bit, it's way better with more flavor.
5894	747	OMG.  This is an amazing recipe for sweet & sour sauce.   I added pineapple tidbits and meatballs for a fantastic appetizer at a family gathering.
5895	747	So easy to make.  I have made this ready for tomorrow night - Xmas Eve and I tasted some and its delicious.  Much nicer than the previous receipts I have used.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Ive actually written you recipe into my recipe journal
5896	747	Make room in the fridge for this dipping Sauce. I had most ingredients on hand.  I boiled the sauce for about 15 minutes because it does thicken as it cools. I served it with chicken nuggets.
5897	747	Love it!!
5898	748	Be careful not to burn it. Mine ended up getting a little burnt. I will reduce the heat when I put in the peppers next time.
5899	748	Liked it a lot! Not spicy which I was worried about, ant least with the paste I got! Added a can of water chestnuts and double the amount of bell peppers for extra veggies. Good be a little more flavorful so I’ll add the curry paste in the oil first and perhaps do a little more paste.
5900	748	We really like this curry. I am not wild  about fish sauce, so I reduced that to one tablespoon. I also added water chestnuts. It is one  of our  favorite curries.
5901	748	Fantastic!! Love it our all family, easy and tasty👍❤️
5902	748	It came out with a good flavor but there was no heat! And it needed more curry flavour. Three chicken breast is to much in my opinion.
5903	748	i am so disappointed with this. the red curry paste is not nearly enough for flavoring. this is a thai dish. thai food is supposed to have bold flavors. this tasted like watered down curry paste which is literally what it is. i really didnt want to use this recipe since its from an unauthentic source but it had so many great ratings i thought id try it. also it may have been the bamboo shoots brand i bought that were not good but it smelled like straight chemicals. it was the only one offered at my local asian grocery store. i’m giving this three stars because it wasn’t terrible but it was NOT good. i hate that i made so much too because i do NOT look forward to eating the rest of it. i’ll probably add more seasonings to give it some kind of life because this dish was plain.
5904	748	We found it bland, no spice to it at all.  I guess I should have picked up on that on the list of ingredients alone.  Thai food should be spicy, so this fell really flat.
5905	748	Truly excellent, particularly in following a few of the additions made by others.  Cook chicken in the curry first, use pineapple juice instead of sugar, do not overcook the veggies, use corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce, and optionally grill up the onions to impart a nutty flavor to it...all around this is a huge hit! (depending on the curry vendor) This recipe is easily made vegan by using tofu, adding when you put in the veggies
5906	748	I made this following the recipe almost exactly.  I reduced the fish sauce to 2tbs and added baby corn.  I used the full 4tbs of red curry concentrate, adding it to oil as others suggested.
5907	749	This is very delicious and smooth so it can sneak up on you if you aren’t careful. I didn’t want to waste the pineapple so I used it as garnish. Yummy!
5908	749	Super easy and super tasty. Worth the wait!
5909	749	Lovely and simple recipe if you plan ahead (10 days). This is similar (if not the same) drink they call VIP at Del Frisco's and the Stoli Doli at Capital Grille.
5911	750	Made a half-pie sized pie with my little pie dish.  I used 3/4 of the recipe of filling for my pie.  Substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar.  My crust was getting dark, so I covered with foil.  I was still worried it would burn, so only baked it 25 minutes.  Came out delicious!  This was my first pineapple pie, but it won't be my last.
5912	750	Perfect. I can’t imagine how it could get any better than this, especially right out of the oven…cooled of course.
5913	750	So easy to make.  Taste  delicious  I used less sugar  than the recipe called for  .Pineapple sweet  .
5914	750	Super easy and delicious!
5915	750	Just like my grandma used to make! My favorite flavor of pie! I make it for Easter every year.
5916	750	I love this recipe!!!  I've tried others but by far this is the best recipe for me.
5917	750	Doubled the recipe after reading others reviews.   My tweaks to the recipe were: Added a half tsp salt, and Tbsp of vanilla.   I used one can of pineapple and a fresh pineapple. I pre-Baked a crust in a 9” pie pan (pre-made rolled up kind)) and it shrank down so much I didn’t need to double the batch!  I decided to forgo making a lemon meringue pie and used the second crust for a second pineapple pie.  This one isn’t being pre-baked.  We’ll see how much this crust shrinks!   Flavor of the filling seemed good!  Kind of pineapple up-side down cake flavor!
5918	750	Easy to make and delicious!
5919	751	Its mostly personal preference. I was looking for a glaze with a brighter flavor. more fruit less chicken broth. I think the next time I will substitute pineapple juice for chicken broth and add a little lemon juice.
5920	751	Add Chunks of Bell Pepper in cooking process.
5921	751	Glaze was awesome....I can see using this glaze with a lot of different recipes....great meal and even my biggest critic, my mom, loved it....pineapple is definitely a crowd pleaser....I will use this glaze with spare ribs no doubt....I chose garlic mashed potatoes for a side and there were no leftovers....🙂
5922	751	I added pineapple chunks and a bit more juice. It was easy and delicious!
5923	751	I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe ,but honestly you just have to season it to your own personal taste. Make sure you taste the sauce before you thicken it. The thickening agent will make it sweet so think about the sugar to salt ratio and also consider what you're envisioning it will taste like and adjust accordingly. It could use some garlic and onions for sure to make it pop , maybe even a little extra salt or soy sauce but that's just me personally. If you're a huge fan of pineapple , the pineapple taste is there but it is not dominant . I also recommend adding pineapple chunks to your sauce.
5924	751	I followed the recipe and it was great
5925	751	Instead of pork chops, I used some pork that I had cut up for Kabobs.  It worked well.  I also added waterchestnuts for that crunch, and a teaspoon of ginger for a little snap.
5926	751	Delicious! I substituted Truvia brown sugar and it was great. I served over cauliflower rice and peas. I will make this again!
5927	751	It was delish, didn't change anything
5928	752	I like this as a base recipe. I used a tropical cake mix with one cup of water but added 3 eggs. To the topping I added some chopped pecans nor a bit of crunch. It turned out delicious. Topped each serving with extra creamy cool whip and we were all in heaven with each bite.
5929	752	It’s amazing! I’m using for my school project and I got an 100! I highly recommend this recipe because the instructions is so descriptive and good! If you never ever made a pineapple upside down cake, choose DOLE! They make it very simple and fun! My grandparents can’t stand using DOLE. Thank you DOLE!
5930	752	I felt it needed more of the brown sugar and margarine/butter mix. I used the Duncan Hines pineapple cake mix and used the juice from the can of pineapple instead of water. It was moist and tasty. Next time I will melt the butter and sprinkle the brown sugar on top of it. Then add the pineapple slices etc.
5931	752	Very easy to make and delicious!
5932	752	A wonderful cake. Like many others, i used a standard box of cake mix, and made two 9" cakes. Stacked one on the other, and it was beautiful, and VERY tasty. I added a little coconut and cinnamon to the pineapple topping. Baking time was approximately 35 minutes. LOVED THIS CAKE!
5933	752	I replaced half of the water with pineapple juice. So yummy.
5934	752	This turned out really good. I made 2 cakes due to having a larger cake mix and used the juice in place of the cake mix's water. Very moist and delicious!
5935	752	This cake was so good and very easy to make! Used a pineapple cake mix & dried the cherries on a paper towel before placing in center of pineapple rings. Cake was moist and delicious! Huge hit in this house!
5936	752	vety good and fast to make
5937	753	Easy. Leave the cake whole and serve on the side. This is delicious.
5938	753	What a refreshing and light dessert.  Made it for guests after game night at our house, where everyone brought appetizers and food.  This cake was the perfect end - not too sweet and not too heavy
5939	753	This has become my traditional dessert for Easter. I’ve made it ever since it came out in the Food and Family magazine. It is delicious.
5940	753	When I make this I tear up the cake and layer it with the other things in a 9X13 pan or a bowl.
5941	753	It Was Sooo Good , I Could Have Eaten  It Right Outta Of The Bowl.  One Recipe  I Won't Live Without  .!
5942	753	Totally easy. Used a loaf cake instead of the round one and had too much lush almost. Made enough for one and a half loaves between all layers and on all the sides. Used real whipped cream, maybe a cup or so un whipped (still whipped it tho). Uber tasty and perfect for those hot evenings 🙂
5943	753	I used mini bunt shaped Angel food cakes I get at my local Marcs, and let them put it on their cake.
5944	753	Made for several family functions. Cheap and super easy to make. Light and fluffy!
5945	753	First time... turned out amazing!!
5946	161	Best ham glaze I've ever had. I followed the directions as written. This one is a keeper!
5947	161	I followed recipe to the letter.  However, my ham burned.  Two hours at 400 is way too much for a 10lb ham.  In fact, my ham was closed to 11lbs. I was able to salvage the inner portion, otherwise we would not have had a thanksgiving dinner
5948	161	super delicious and moist
5985	758	Wonderfully tangy dressing! Easy to make too.
5986	758	This recipe is wonderful(mostly). I hate cilantro so I use celery seed instead.
5987	758	I didn't have apple cider vinegar, so I subbed  3/4 th white vinegar and 1/4 apple juice.  I also subbed splenda brown sugar for regular.  It was delish!
5949	161	I altered the recipe. Yes I did place quarter cup of water in pan..My glaze was made with mustard, vinegar, pineapple juice, brown sugar and orange marmalade. Yes marmalade. My grandmother always used vinegar and mustard to tenderize the pork. Old southern trick. I used pineapple slices and navel orange slices to cover ham.  Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Turned oven down to 350. Began using second covering of glaze.  It was delicious. My family even tasted the garnish.
5950	161	I flavour was great! I will make it again.
5951	161	Yummy. Did not alter recipe and used a picnic ham. Tender, sweet and juicy
5952	161	Instead of boiling water I used a can of ginglerale..  I followed the recipe and it was sooooo goood!!!  Will make again,,
5953	161	Best Ham I've ever made, thank you!  Moist and delicious.
5954	161	Excellent - Great Presentation
5955	755	I thought this was a seasonally appropriate recipe to take on.  The only changes or addition I made was adding a tablespoon of lemon juice, and the directions called for 8oz can pineapple pieces. I added 2-4 oz’s more, and when complete, I wish I had put the whole 30oz can into it. The pineapple to me gave the bread a new vibe, fresh, not to mention I love pineapple, but everything else was on point. I will definitely be making this again soon, as my wife said, It’s a Winner!🏆🥇
5956	755	This bread turns out so wonderful, moist and delicious.  I added chopped walnuts and made mine in mini loaf pans.  Great for gifts and good size for just the two of us.
5957	755	This bread did not disappoint.  Based on other reviews, I used a mix of white and brown sugar and replaced half of the oil with applesauce.  I also used three eggs instead of 4 and that was fine. I added nuts and raisins to one loaf and preferred that to the plain one. I also needed to turn my oven down as it tends to run hot and my loaves browned too quickly.
5958	755	I have been using this recipe for years.  It is one of my favorite recipes.  My family eats it for breakfast.
5959	755	Very moist. Everyone loved it!
5960	755	followed instructions to the Tee!
5961	755	Made this recipe as written. Everyone loved it.
5962	755	I don't really think zucchini when I think baking, this may be the first zucchini bread I have ever made.  My husband and I loved it!.  I only had one loaf pan so I used a jumbo muffin ban to bake the "other half".  The muffins took half the time.  Thank you for sharing an absolutely delicious recipe.  I will make it again.  I may even buy zucchini on purpose just to make some!  haha
5963	755	very moist and delicious.  I halved the orig recipe but still should have used 8oz of pineapple
5964	756	This salsa is SO good! We devoured it with scoops tortilla chips last weekend. A second batch tonight will be served with grilled jerk chicken and rice.
5965	756	Used a whole pineapple and tripled the recipe for my family. This is a great recipe and added a fresh taste to our fish tonight.
5966	756	Just got an, “Oh my gosh, Mom!”, with a plethora of sounds coming from his mouth. This is PERFECT just as is!  A keeper!! Perfect of sweet and spicy!
5967	756	I used canned pineapple.  Made a double batch, put it over pan fried haddock and people inhaled the dish.  I ate quite a bit of fish too even though I'm not a huge fan of haddock.  The leftover salsa stayed in the fridge for a few days so I added fresh mango, put it over haddock again and had the same reaction.  This is extraordinarily good.
5968	756	Oh my . . . what a wonderfullly refreshing salsa! I made it to serve as an afternoon snack with Tostito chips (lime flavoured), and what was left over was served as a condiment with our chicken fajitas at supper. It was soooo good, I even made a double batch later in the evening to cut up the rest of our fresh pineapple and let the salsa chill and blend flavours overnight. I made the recipe as is with the exception of: using green pepper instead of red (that's what we had); leaving out the jalapeño pepper (we didn't have any); we did add the optional garlic; and added ~10 grape tomatoes (each cut into 8 small pieces) to add some red colour. I can't wait to have some again tomorrow!! Yum!! (If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!)
5969	756	This was delicious on our blackened tilapia. We didn't have a red bell pepper and decided to try something new. We used pomegranate kernels instead! Super yummy. Our jalapeno was large so it made up for any possible missing pepper to taste. Will definitely use this recipe over and over
5970	756	I forgot to buy a red bell pepper, so I substituted some cucumber.  It was amazing!  I served it with grilled tilapia on tacos.  I used the marinade from "Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing" for the tilapia.  Great combination!
5971	756	Used everything called for but as suggested used papaya instead of mango! Was Delicious! Would make it again! Thx!
5972	756	So refreshing on a hot summer day
5973	757	So good. Made it with chilli garlic roasties and sprouts. All ready in well under an hour. A triumph!
5974	757	This recipe saved my bacon tonight (pun fully intended)!  I followed the recipe pretty much as written except I added 2 T. of water before sealing the Instant Pot and I had to use commercial pancake syrup in place of maple syrup.  It was very tasty, made my 1.4 kg ham in the time indicated, and the sauce was very good.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.
5975	757	Good
5976	757	So thankful to find this excellent recipe for a frozen ham.  I didn’t have pineapple so I added 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/2 cup water.  I also used honey instead of maple syrup.  The ham was very tender and delicious.  It took about 30 minutes for a natural release but I’m sure this time varies according to the ingredients used.
5977	757	Had no honey, but did have maple syrup.... works just as well!
5978	757	I'm rather impressed with having a frozen ham into a cooked ham in a short amount of time. I had pineapple rings on hand which worked just perfect. I would recommend more cornstarch for a thicker sauce, but that's a preference thing. Would make again and could fit an even bigger ham if needed.
5979	758	I tried this for the first time a  few days ago and I think it's the best Cole Slaw recipes I have ever tasted. I found it was best the second day.
5980	758	I made this it's awesome. I didn't have can pineapple so I used fresh. My husband says this is a keeper
5981	758	We love this recipe!  Great with Ribs, fish tacos, and even just plain and add a little protien if you want!  Made this already twice in last 10 days!  I like the multi color cabbage, carrots etc mix
5982	758	Followed the recipe as written, just made double. This was a huge hit with all the guys at my husband’s plant.  Excellent as the slaw served on top of a pulled pork sandwich. The pineapple  balances the cabbage and the vinegary dressing. I am picky about slaw, and I really liked this one too!
5983	758	This was incredible delicious. We will be making this again & soon!
5988	759	I didn't change the recipe. It definitely needed morre time to bake. Didn't rise as much as in the picture. Soggy in the centre. Taste of pineapple was lost. Topping was a bit chewy. D;ifficult to get out of the muffin pan. Disappointing for all the prep that was needed and ingredients.
5989	759	I stirred the pineapple into the batter at the end because I didn’t read the directions carefully. I threw in a big handful of coconut and did not add butter on top. I put a half a maraschino cherry on top and a teaspoon of the crushed pineapple I had left because I had the larger can. I think I could have cut down on the sugar just a bit. I think this is a fabulous recipe. I would love to serve these in the afternoon with tea.
5990	759	These are ok, nothing great.
5991	759	Only added 1/3 cup coconut.  Muffins are very dense.  They are edible, but won’t make this recipe again
5992	759	These are delicious! I followed other’s advice and add the pineapple to the batter. Next time I’ll add more juice to enhance the pineapple flavor. Really good ones!
5993	759	I made this with the pulp of my pineapples and carrots after juicing them. The muffins were moist and delicious!! I added the pulp of my pineapples and carrots to add additional all natural sweetness.. I will definitely made this again!!!!
5994	759	These were disappointing for me... I read through the reviews and put one cup finely chopped fresh pineapple in the batter as many had recommended, but the muffin was underwhelming. The streusel topping sank into the muffin and because of that wasn’t really crunchy or very noticeable. The muffin itself also had a bit of a strange taste, I wonder if 1 tbsp baking powder is just too much...
5995	759	Ended up really crumbly. I used fresh pineapple, added most of the pineapple into the batter. Reserved a small amount for topping. Would add more reserved pineapple next time, otherwise really great taste-wise.
5996	759	We really liked this recipe. I would add some crushed pineapple into the cake part next time to drive home the pineapple.  I did use some of the juice and spooned over the top of each muffin while they were hot.
5997	760	I don't recommend trying this with any other cut of pork besides what is listed. I tried it with pork loin because my grocery store only sold pork butt in huge quantities, and I wanted something a bit less fatty. I figured it wouldn't change much -- I was wrong. I followed the instructions exactly and didn't adjust the cooking time. The pork was cooked fine but the sauce turned out very weird and separated, so I didn't want to pour it over the meat. As a result the pork was quite dry. I know this is my fault for not following the recipe, but I'm still giving it 3 stars because the flavor simply is not like true tacos as pastor. It's far too sweet.
5998	760	My husband declared this better than our favorite Mexican restaurants version. This will definitely be a keeper.
5999	760	Complicated but well worth the effort! al Pastor tastes amazing!
6000	760	This recipe, which I followed exactly, made a fine and tasty meal, but I have to say it tasted nothing like authentic Mexican pastor meat.  I had high hopes given some ingredients I had never used before (sazon and chipotle peppers in adobo) but sadly, that elusive pastor flavor just wasn't there. Plus, it was a heckuva lot of work! To me it was much closer to a pulled pork sandwich in flavor than a Mexican pastor taco.  Kudos, however, for the high pressure method which did indeed create perfectly fall apart meat. Note: I marinated for about 9 hours -- no doubt it might have been better to marinate even longer but I still don't think the flavor would be there. Search continues for at-home pastor...
6001	760	Perfect recipe for the home cook to make al pastor! The flavor profile was spot on to us and took us back to Mexico, where our obsession with al pastor began. I made the recipe as written with minor substitutes and cook time adjustment due to the amount of meat I had. The only substitutes I made were using canned Chipotle sauce as the Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce were out of stock (used 3 tbsp sauce and probably should have added another 1-2 tbsp), and corn tortillas as that's our preference. I had about 4.5lb pork butt and cooked for 45 min with 15-20 min natural pressure release. Since I made this the night before, I saved the juices in the pot in another container to reheat the meat in the oven so it wouldn't dry out. This recipe is the only one I will make going forward for al pastor. Thank you for the recipe!
6002	760	I am a big big fan of the Al Pastor at my local Mexican restaurant. Have been a little intimidated by the traditional spit roasting, so looked up a recipe that was a little more accessible.
6003	760	Made it for for 12, it was delish! Homemade guacamole and homemade pick de Gallo, used corn tortillas for more flavor. I would use crushed pineapple next time.
6004	761	This was delicious and my husband loved it.   We were both surprised how delicious it was, definitely a keeper
6005	761	I made this but added 3/4 cup of soy milk to make it a little more cobbler-ish?. I left some of the pineapple juice in with the pineapple.? I used half the sugar.? I left some of the pineapple juice in with the pineapple. It turned out great.! I think it could’ve used a little less butter.?
6006	761	This was wonderful with our baked ham. It was a bit too sweet but I can adjust that next time.
6007	761	Didn’t turn out great at all
6008	761	I made it for Easter, it was excellent!  Was great with our ham, I didn't change a thing. Definitely will make it again.
6009	761	When I grease the pan I used sugar and cinnamon around the edges and I stirred in 2 tablespoons of cinnamon it was for a Christmas luncheon for ladies over 60 people attended  and they raved about the baked pineapple
6010	761	This simple dish has become a staple at our family holiday parties. I took it recently to a BBQ and it was a big hit.
6011	761	Awesome
6012	761	I don't really like pineapple, made this to go with ham for an Easter dinner... well I loved it, everyone did.  only used 1/2 the sugar, as suggested by others, didn't use the butter on top - just didn't see a point to it.  Great on ham sandwiches the next day instead of using mustard or something else.  I'm going to make it again and put in jar in fridge to keep as a spread for toast or biscuits -
6013	762	Have tried many sweet and sour recipes that the family love.  Unfortunately this is not one of them.
6014	762	It was good. My boyfriend ate most of it!. I'll make more next time. Thanks for providing a  great recipe.
6015	762	Easy to make, delicious and fun!!
6016	762	This is so yummy. I made it with pork not chicken and added thinly sliced carrots. Super good.
6017	762	This was absolutely amazing. So easy too!
6018	762	Make it at least once a week, delicious
6019	762	Delicious!  I added some peanuts as a garnish before serving over some Basmati rice... just because!
7655	978	I added 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of coconut milk to the vanilla pudding.
6020	762	This was a yummy dinner enjoyed by kids and grownups alike. I did make a few changes, the main one being substituting cornstarch for the flour, I prefer the way it coats and browns. I cut the lemon juice way down and added white vinegar. I was making a larger batch so I kind of eyeballed the rest of the ingredient amounts. I think this is a sauce you need to taste as you mix because there is a certain amount of personal preference when it comes to the sauce. We will definitely enjoy having this meal again!
6021	762	I made it and loved it.  I used this recipe, but the jar of Chinese Sweet & Sour sauce from the store for sauce an put over brown rice.  Outstanding, especially if you just pineapple chunks and stir fry vegs till just staring to soften - 5 minutes.  They need to have some crispness.
6022	763	I was so disappointed with this. I followed the directions but used a very small quantity of garlic powder. It's so boring and the small amount of onion powder is overwhelming.  I thought that it would have a stronger pineapple taste.
6023	763	I followed the directions, and found it was delicious.
6024	763	I cannot rate this recipe as listed because I have made this for 30 years with only cream cheese and crushed pineapple.  I use 2 pkg and a 20 oz can with a little of the juice mixed in to cream it up and make it easier to scoop.  I don't need to add anything else to it as it is soooo good the way it is.  Best with wavy potato chips.  No one can stop !  BTW: to submit this comment I HAD to rate it. Don't think I'd like the garlic.
6025	763	I mixed in a couple shakes of red pepper flakes  for a little” zing, and added crushed macadamia nuts on top.
6026	763	Very interesting flavors! I had fresh pineapple which I crushed with a potato masher. I also didn't have onion powder, so I minced a little red onion for some color. Served with crackers although I'm sure it's even better with French bread slices. Next time I will choose smaller garlic cloves. Nice find! Thanks!
6027	763	I would of given it 5 stars, but the garlic was over powering,
6028	763	This dip is delicious and can't be any easier to make. I followed the recipe  and the sugestions to make it the night before. Served it with bagel chips and it was hit.
6029	763	I add jalapeño because we like it spicy- best go to recipe!
6030	763	Can I give this, like, ten stars?? I was skeptical, but I had a little cream cheese left over to use up, and pineapple for another recipe I'm getting ready to make. I made this, put it on some thin toast, and it is truly one of The Very Best Things I have ever put in my mouth. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
6031	764	I like this recipe bc it doesn't call for extra sugar.  I followed (13x9) directions except I put cherry pie filling mixed w/1T of rum extract on the bottom of pan.   Poured batter over cherry pie filling.Baked at 360F for 10 min, then 35 min at 350F, turned off left in the oven for another 10 min.   It inverted to the cake tray perfectly (upside down cake).It doesn't need icing; however, icing is always good.  Glad I found this.  Thanks.
6032	764	Added an extra egg and instant vanilla pudding to cake mix.  Sliced Maraschino cherries on top. No nuts. Also only one layer in a 9x13 pan
6033	764	This cake is even better when made with a spice cake mix. Makes wonderful muffins and mini loafs.
6034	764	I made the cake as suggested, using pineapple pieces instead of crushed.  Then I baked it in an 8x8 glass pan.  It took longer to bake, but came out perfectly.  I just dusted it with powdered sugar, but it was moist and held together.
6035	764	THIS WAS GREAT. I ADDED AN EXTRA EGG, AS OTHERS HAD SUGGESTED.  I MADE MINE WITH A PINEAPPLE CAKE MIX. IT WAS OUTSTANDING
6036	764	Family loved it. I flavored the store-bought frosting with a touch of almond and orange extract. Topped the cake with toasted coconut and pecans and served strawberries and whipped cream on the side. Ta-DA!
6037	764	I added an extra egg and baked this in a 9 x 13” pan, and it was WONDERFUL! The frosting makes a lot, so for the 9x13 which I left in the pan (rather than the 3 rounds where you’d most likely frost the sides) it’s a bit too much. But I will say, NO one complained! ??
6038	764	I followed the directions EXCEPT I added about about a half cup of coconut.  It took almost 20 minutes longer to bake but my husband loves it.
6039	764	This was super moist and delicious.  Cooked it in a 9x12 pan for about 10 minutes longer.
6040	765	no
6041	765	Easy to make and it taste so good.
6042	765	Tried making this in the microwave with already cooked chicken.  Put chicken in after the liquid thickened a little.  Made a double batch.  Turned out well.
6043	765	Anybody like my cook i like it
6044	765	Followed changes of doubled brwn sugar & vinegar & making twice amount sauce. Did season chicken ; I agree for spice lovers could use a little zip but for picky eaters a very nice solid dish. Will make again!
6045	765	Super easy!! Followed the recipe to a T except added some thinly sliced onions. Even my picky hubby loved it. So much healthier than restaurant sweet and sour fried balls of chicken!!
6046	765	My family love this recipe!
6047	765	Added a half tablespoon of sesame oil
6048	765	WAY too much soy sauce for this to be sweet and sour sauce. Really disappointed. The dish came out incredibly salty and trying to balance it out with more sugar just resulted in a subpar dish.
6049	766	It was pretty good, if maybe a little bit too sweet.  I also think the sauce thickened up just a bit too much - congealed rather than 'saucy'.  I'd cut back on both the brown sugar and cornstarch slightly.  I did add veggies (broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms) as many other reviewers did, and sauteed those before adding the onion, garlic (an addition) and ham  into the pan.  Served over white rice.  Good use for leftover ham.
6050	766	Yes I made one change. I didn’t have any green onions, so I used 1/2 of a regular onion. I will make sure to have green onions next time, for color. Also maybe  a little green red pepper for color. It was easy, and quick to make. My husband liked it over rice.. there was a little more leftover, maybe enough for 1.
6051	766	Easy & tastes great.  Added: peas & green pepper.  skipped the brown sugar.
6085	770	I added some chopped green peppers, chopped onions and chopped carrots after I removed the pork from the fry pan.  When they were partly softened, I removed from the pan before adding the butter and pineapple.  I added those veggies back in when I put in the sauce and pork (I cut into bitesize pieces while the veggies were cooking).  I served it over Jasmine rice.  Great recipe!
6086	770	Loved it but I grilled the tenderloin and cut it into medallions before I put them in the sauce and I used crushed pineapple in the sauce in stead of chunks...  something a little diff...
6370	811	I added about an extra cup and half of flour and worked the dough balls into their shape with floured hands and counter.
6052	766	This recipe is terrific. I served mine over Orzo (cuz I don’t care for white rice). But you could totally use any style of rice, Saffron, egg noodles, or whatever.  I didn’t have green onions, so I just chopped up purple onion cuz it’s what I had - about a quarter cup in a frying pan.  I sauteed them in the pan with the butter, then I added the drained pineapples and ham and turned it off (I used the left-over country ham from breakfast).  The recipe called for 1-1/3 cups of pineapple juice, but I only had about 1 cup of the juice from the pineapple can, so I topped it off with orange juice in my fridge.  I warmed the juice & apple cider vinegar on the stove with the brown sugar & Dijon mustard (since I don’t know what “prepared mustard” is).  Then I poured it into a bowl and whisked in the cornstarch by hand and poured it all over the pineapples, ham & onion in the pan - Put on medium heat until thick.  Note:  Be careful while stirring the pineapples & ham, so it doesn’t turn to mush.
6053	766	Very tasty. Didn't use the vinegar. Came out great. Served green peas as a side. Highly recommend for a simple dinner for two people.
6054	766	We doubled the amount of ham in the recipe and served it with broccoli on the side. Really good that way.
6055	766	Thank you for this great recipe! Made it exactly as directed except for one red onion instead of the green I didn't have on hand. Simmered a bit longer while long grain and wild rice cooked. Delicious! NOT too sweet, just right.
6056	766	My son and husband liked it, in all honesty I will not make it again.  Just wasnt that great to us, sounds like a lot of people liked it so I hate to say anything negative, try it and see.
6057	766	It was OK, a good way to use up leftover ham. Used fresh pineapple and served over white rice. A little too sweet for my preference.
6058	374	This was tasty and fun.  We used frozen fruit mix of mangos, pineapples, peaches and strawberries, and it turned out well.   We mixed it the evening before, but waited to add the Sprite until right before we served it.  In hindsight, we should have listened to the author and mixed it all together to rest overnight.  It was definitely better the 2nd day, with the flavors having had time to meld and the Sprite to blend.
6059	374	We made this to go with our Mexican themed dinner with friends.  It was a huge hit!  Since peaches weren't in season, we added raspberries, pears and strawberries.  It was tasty and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again.
6060	374	I brought it to a family gathering and it was a huge hit!
6061	374	Love this and I get two treats out of it!
6062	374	I always run out and the dispenser is in the air while the last few guests are trying to get the last drop. It’s a big hit.
6063	374	I used 2 bottles of moscato, 1/2 cup of peach brandy, and 1/4 cup peach schnapps. It was a big hit!
6064	374	This recipe is amazing! Everyone LOVES it when I bring this sangria to the BBQ. First Sangria I ever made, super easy, I used Cavit Moscato wine, and it was perfect!
6065	374	This was delicious and loved by all. I made a couple changes. I used apricot brandy and Pinot Grigio.   It is a very versatile sangria and could be changed to your taste.
6066	374	This tastes like summer in your mouth! Especially great for an outdoor party! It was delicious. I didn’t use the full measure of peach schnapps based on other reviews. And just upped my fresh peaches. This was a big hit. Definitely a keeper.
6067	768	Didn't taste pineapple whatsoever.
6068	768	liked it but will use more pineapple next time and i like the brown sugar thought.  I was thinking next time to add maraschino cherries like pineapple upside down cake
6069	768	I actually changed the recipe a bit. Instead of walnuts I substituted coconut flakes. Instead of butter I substituted coconut oil. And I added 2 bananas to the mixture. It came out so moist and delicious!
6070	768	I made this vegan for my brother by sub'g apple sauce for butter and chia seeds for eggs ( 1 TBL chia + 2 TBL water per egg) . I also followed the advice of others. I added 1 20oz can of pinapple , juice and all.  Also added 1/4 tsp cinn and 1 tsp allspice, and put brown sugar on top. they said it was great. like an pineapple upside down cake-- and they are bakers. I asked about the coconut and they said if adding coconut put on top so it browns nicely. I also sugg adding rum , which was well recieved  ;  ).
6071	768	This recipe is very good! I unfortunately did not have crushed pineapple, so I used my pineapple chunks. It came out good. I added some of the juice to the batter. All flavors were balanced! Will make it again.
6072	768	I made this for my husband and he definitely enjoyed it but it didn't have a
6073	768	This recipe was good, but I think the bake time was a little too long for my oven, it came out a bit dry. I took the basic recipe and added coconut and macadamia nuts and rum flavoring for a whole tropical vibe. Would make again, but back off the cook time a little bit.
6074	768	I'm not a fan of pineapple, but my son requested some pineapple bread and I decided to try this recipe. I did what other reviewers recommended and used 1/2 cup pineapple and 1/2 cup juice. The flavor was very mild, which I enjoyed, but my son said he would prefer a stronger pineapple flavor. I will definitely be making this again and possibly trying other suggestions to increase the flavor.
6075	768	Super simple and super tasty! Definitely a new favorite!
6076	164	Simply the best ham glaze I have ever made.  My husband loves it  because it's not very sweet.
6077	164	Did just like the recipe but I added a teaspoon of Dijon mustard. It was a big hit with my whole family. I will definitely use this again.
6078	164	Wonderful and absolutely delicious glaze.  Added a pinch of ground cloves and a dash of maraschino cherry juice.  Reduced on the stove for about 10 minutes.   Used this glaze on a Hatfield boneless ham.
6079	164	my ham tasted excellent with this glaze.  not thick, just a light coating.  justnperfect for the family.
6080	164	It was quick and easy. I stuck cloves in the ham.Everyone had seconds so it was a hit.
6081	164	Excellent Glaze!  Have used several times basting the ham during cooking.  This last time I added some of the maraschino cherry juice to the mixture and everyone loved it.
6082	164	I HAD TO COOK THE GLAZE ON STOVE BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT THICKED.
6083	164	easy and delish!
6084	164	Definitely will make it again .  I put pineapple slices on to with toothpicks,  no other changes.  I used a 9 lb fully cooked smoked ham and cooked it on low for 6 hours. Was ready by 5 hours.  Delicious
6087	770	I doubled the sauce part of the recipe including the pineapple chunks.  Probably the best sauce we’ve ever made!  Not too sweet and it was spicy.  Not your typical sweet/sour sauce.  We used the sauce for the next few days to dip egg rolls in and some in fried rice later too.  You could replace pork with chicken or beef. The sauce is amazing!!
6088	770	yum! Made it with fresh pineapple, added onion, green pepper and carrots! subbed Lilly white corn syrup and water 50/50 for the canned pineapple juice. Turned out great!
6089	770	Made the dish for 2 people using left over cooked pork tenderloin. Stir fried mix of veggies, peppers, onion, carrots, green beans then put them aside and followed the rest of the recipe adding them back in with the pork at the end. I made the sauce as with a few small changes. It was the perfect amount of sauce  for 2. I would double the sauce for 4 as stated in another review. Only added  1 tsp of hot sauce and no pepper flakes it was just the right amount of heat for us. Also grated the  1 clove of garlic and some ginger into the sauce mix before cooking. Served over Jasmine rice it was delicious.
6090	770	Great recipe, the sauce needs a little more brown sugar and I fried the meat with a batter made from potato starch, salt, pepper, and almond milk.
6091	770	Sooo good, family loved it. I upped the crushed red pepper because we like spicy, and added diced red peppers. Excellent.
6092	770	Easy, delicious. It just tastes healthier too!
6093	770	Turned out great but I added sliced carrots & celery.  I did not have green bell pepper but substituted yellow bell pepper.  Could also add chopped sweet round onion too.
6094	771	Very quick and easy. I add walnuts instead of pecans and finely diced celery for more texture. I blended it all together. It turned out great
6095	771	I use raspberry and lemon jello, a tsp of sugar,some diced celery (surprisingly amazing..i like celery,though) n pecan bits mix in well. Almost like a dessert. Great at Thanksgiving. Also good with roast/rotisserie chicken.
6096	771	Have been serving this at Thanksgiving dinner for several years, including this one.  It's a big hit and refreshing among all the carb-heavy dishes.
6097	771	I will be making this. I'm glad to find a recipe like I usually make it.  I did just notice the can of Cranberry Sauce called for is 16 oz.  My cans say they are 14 oz. I doubt it will matter much. I'll probably add some Mandarin Oranges anyway.
6098	771	Loved this but added a cup of celery and used the whole berry cranberry sauce.   Easy to make and tasted great.   Will definitely make this again.   Friends asked for the recipe, too.
6099	771	I made it for dinner tomorrow but I had to taste it. My taste was very good. I followed the directions and did add 1 chopped apple and stirred the pecans into the salad instead of on top. Delicious@
6100	771	Use 3 cups boiling water, large box of cherry jello.
6101	771	This is basically the recipe my grandmother used, with one important exception. My family uses strawberry Jello,  adding a little orange zest. Also some celery adds a nice touch also. My family has used this basic recipe in all it variants. We don't sit down for Thanksgiving turkey without it.
6102	771	This recipe has been in our family for years and we've been making it for the winter holidays since the 70s.  The only thing I do a little differently is to make sure the cranberry sauce melts into the hot jello and then I mix the chopped pecans in with the crushed pineapple.  We also put ours in a jello ring mold, let it set overnight in the fridge, and then unmold and slice it like a bundt cake for serving.  It's a great recipe and is easy to make and always turns out great!
6103	772	Love this recipe! I add the sugar and omit the pineapple juice. It’s a hit!
6104	772	Made this several times for family holidays and just brought it in for work pot luck. I would definitely recommend using a fresh pinapple cut in tid bit size pieces. It's a little more work but it takes the flavor to the next level.
6105	772	One of my absolutely favorite recipes, of all time! Total comfort food.
6106	772	I followed the recipe as written. I wasn't sure what to expect, I had never heard of this before, but it is pretty good. If I make it again I will probably add some coconut and top each piece I serve with a maraschino cherry.
6107	772	Perfection!!!
6108	772	I always make the recipe exactly as is the first time. It was awesome. I read some comments on sugar, but that's personal taste. You could eat the pineapple straight out of the can and they would be fine, but sugar makes them taste better. I like the amount of sugar in the recipe.
6109	772	This was absolutely delicious! Being from the Northeast I never heard of this dish before, but wanted to try it as I had some pineapple to use up. It’s very sweet and would make a wonderful addition to any other side dishes at the table...or to simply eat by itself for brunch! It would go very well with ham! Beware of the type of cheese you use, however. I used a generic shredded cheddar cheese and it didn’t melt- I suppose it had rather large quantities of cellulose. It may be worth it to shred the cheese yourself. Regardless, it didn’t affect the taste. It was still delicious!
6110	772	I added jalapeno cheese with the hard cheddar cheese.
6111	772	This recipe is divine!!! I have made this wonderful recipe numerous times since I saved it - wowza! I’ve shared this recipe with others who now also make it often. It’s perfect as written and never disappoints! Thank you!
6112	773	Love this recipe. Easy to make and everyone loves it.
6113	773	I have made Rosa Marina for years, and it is a reliable hit. I mix the pasta and thickened juices and let them blend overnight before adding the fruit. Also, I have found that an 8oz. tub of Cool Whip is plenty.
6114	773	Instead of the chunks of pineapple, cherries and mandarin oranges, I cut up strawberries and added blueberries. It was delicious.
6115	773	Most definitely make again. My kids loved it! I added a small bag of flavored mini marshmallows when I mixed in the whipped topping ??
6116	773	I just LOVE this, the last time I ate it all myself. Works great at a picnic on a hot summer day also.
6117	773	Went over well for a work potluck!
6118	773	Delicious as-is! But I usually make it without the eggs, flour, and added sugar. I simply mix the cooked orzo with the fruits (the kind packed in 100% fruit juice) and their juices and let that refrigerate until I'm ready to eat it. Then I fold in the whipped cream and serve. Yum!
6119	773	The orzo made it weird and unpleasant. Many tried it, no one took more than a spoonful and it went into the garbage.
6120	773	Exchanged 1 can of pineapples for a can of pears. This salad is absolutely delicious. I have made several different recipes but Iikea this one!
6121	774	Very Good!  I made some pork kabobs and shrimp kabobs using the same marinade,  all were good!
6122	774	Keep the pineapple separate from the chicken.  I marinated it for over a day but the chicken wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.
6290	802	This Sushi Roll recipe is too die for. I was really impressed. It was AMAZING!!! honestly, if you haven't tried this recipe you have to it is the best. It was really simple and easy instructions.
6123	774	I made this tonight and used all the ingredients, but didn't measure them, just winged it.  I cut the chicken into about 1-1/2" cubes.  I also used all the liquid from the canned pineapple for the marinade. Turned out well!  I took others' advice and marinated the chicken and pineapple in separate containers.  After putting the chicken and pineapple on separate skewers, I thickened the marinade FROM THE PINEAPPLE with some cornstarch and used the mixture to glaze both while grilling them.  Served with white rice, and will make again! :)  BTW, use canned pineapple, not fresh.
6124	774	I used rice vinegar instead of sherry
6125	774	These were awesome we put them in a flour tortilla with zoodles and grilled jalapeños the best! As for the recipe I read it made the marinade to roughly the same measurements given... Marinade for 4 hours and hubby cooked them with hickory pellets on his grill.... the best tacos I have had in a very long time. Only bummer is there was not enough for seconds... AND IT WAS TACOS.. so we will be having these again
6126	774	Loved this!! Marinated it over night. Great summer meal!
6127	774	Delicious! Only change was I used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any sherry. Came out great!
6128	774	The marinade flavor was delicious. But the next time I’m going to marinade the chicken separate from the pineapple. The pineapple juices broke down the texture of the chicken and made it almost chalky.  Other than that, it was a very refreshing, tropical complete meal on a hot summer evening.
6129	774	My family and I loved this recipe.  Only thing I changed was the sherry cause I did not have any so I substituted rice wine vinegar.  We grilled them over mesquite charcoal. It was delicious.  I am making it again tonight and we are making Hawaiian Shrimp Kabobs as well.
6130	775	This was incredible! Served for my husband and friends and everyone loved it. The pineapple and onion is a really intriguing and delicious combination, as is everything else in this recipe. I used my Magic Bullet blender instead of a food processor and it worked great. Will definitely make this again!
6131	775	Made one change to the recipe and added the pineapple chunks at the end and reduced the al pastor on the stove for the last hour.  Absolutely the best I have ever tasted.  I will definitely make this again!
6132	776	I love this recipe but I made some changes. I always double the sauce ingredients because everyone likes to pour the sauce over their rice. I do a full can of pineapple chunks and stir it into the sauce once it’s thickened. Of course it makes it a bit runny again but it’s so tasty no one cares. Sometimes I sub pork for the chicken which is tasty but not as good as chicken. It’s one of those meals that I can everyone to eat even picky eaters. Sometimes throwing some sliced red peppers into the sauce is an extra yummy taste as well. Yum!
6133	776	I've made this a few times and it is really good! I always just used one pan on the stove, so easy that way. Even my picky DH loved it! That's amazing b/c he is sooooo picky! It's a very versatile recipe that can be adapted to what you like. I put carrots in it and snap peas and I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup once and it always turns out great
6134	776	This was so very tasty!  We loved it.  Next time, I might drop back on the butter and sugar.  It was a bit sweeter than we prefer, but it was still very, very good.  I only had pineapple slices in a 20-oz can, so I put half of the slices in a food processor and ground them up, placing the remaining slices on top for garnish with a sprinkle of pepper and tarragon.  Pretty and yummy.  This recipe is a keeper!
6135	776	Nice
6136	776	Nice and easy with fresh flavors!
6137	776	I just made this recipe tonight. Wow it was delicious. Great taste. Great combinations for flavour. Takes a few mins to prepare then bake. Fantastic recipe. Thanks.
6138	776	This was sensational. Loved it
6139	776	I fixed it exactly as the recipe said except for one thing. I didn't have crushed pineapple, but pineapple chunks. I drained the juice from that and put it in a mug and refrigerated it so I could have it later.
6140	776	Delicious !!!  Tweaked it a bit.  Added a clove or two of minced garlic, and a little smoked Chipotle pepper for a subtle zing.  It was good advice to double the sauce.  It allowed to have left over to pour over rice and along with the meat (boneless skinless thighs) made a nice rice bowl.  Next time might add some zucchini to the sauce after it is cooked, should only take about 10 minutes or so to allow it to soften a bit.  This one will be a new regular go to dish.
6141	777	Great recipe. I made the kabobs with pineapple and red bell peppers.
6142	777	So good! I combined my bbq and teriyaki sauces together and spread it over the kabobs as it cooked in the oven. The pineapple was the best part!!
6143	777	Amazing taste!
6144	777	OMG - this was so good.  Only a couple of very slight changes to the recipe that wouldn't affect the outcome.   Most definitely going to be made again and again.  I think this would also work very well with chicken.
6145	777	Excellent. Used pork, mushrooms, cocktail tomatoes, red and yellow or orange peppers, red onion and sometimes corn on the cob in small slices. On basmati rice.
6146	777	Not bad not not as flavorful as  I'd have liked. I did not add any salt, but even so it was boderline too salty from the soy sauce.
6147	777	I did add more brown sugar and garlic powder to the basting sauce.
6148	777	Absolutely delicious! I cut down on the onion though.
6149	777	I made the recipe as written and the kabobs were excellent.  So easy to prepare and my family loved them.
6150	778	Love it!!!!  Thank you so much.    I won't change a thing.
6151	779	Taste just like the Thai restaurants!
6152	779	My favorite salad.  I use 2 Thai chili peppers and its perfect spice.   A few extras peanuts is. The topping
6153	779	The bitterness of the green papaya overwhelmed the other ingredients.
6154	779	Very good
6155	779	We live in the Pacific Islands I love Green Papaya salads. I am forced to substitute Red Peppers for tomatoes. This is a very easy and fun salad and it looks wonderful. We use fresh Basil also which is really Thai traditional. Lovely salad. I may try it as written when or if I reach the states
6187	783	This was a great recipe! We made it in a pan because it was raining, but it still tasted great. We had roasted sweet potatoes with rosemary as a side. This was my first time to try tuna (I am not a big fish eater) and it was great. I will definitely try it again and hopefully next time it's not raining so we can grill it.
6188	783	My boyfriend and I were very surprised by how good this dish was.  We didn't have macadamia nuts so I used finely chopped pecans.  We didn't have hot chile paste so I used 1/2 chopped Jalapeno.  It was delish!  We will do this recipe again, no doubt!
6291	802	Good
6156	779	Note: Make sure you get the fish sauce that has a clear golden look to it (ex. Squid Brand). Also, Asian food stores sell the small mortar (get clay) & pestal (wooden) for around 5-10 dollars (great to use for all spices, plus it looks great in your kitchen...). I dont recommend using food processor, but to use mortar & pestal for garlic smashing and to bruise 12 halved cherry tomatoes. The salad will have a better texture if you just peel the papaya, then cut in half, lay it cut side down and use a julienne peeler so you have nice, long pieces of papaya in your salad. Referring back to the fish sauce -  I accidentally purchased the fish sauce that is Greyish/Cloudy looking, and it was absolutely inedible. I spoke to my friend that turned me on to this salad (she's Thai) and she said that the fish sauce I purchased was more for the authentic Vietnamese cooked dishes. It will ruin your salad, so be very cautious.
6157	779	I had green papaya salad recently while visiting Hawaii.  There, it was fantastic.  I looked at this recipe and thought it sounded the same.  I didn't like it at all.  Maybe my papaya was too ripe.  The fish sauce was definitely too much.  I'll try to make it again, but next time, I'll make the salad as soon as I buy the fruit.
6158	779	Great salad.  If you don't julienne the papaya by hand (ridiculously time consuming), use the shredder in the food processor.  I buy the long beans for the recipe and cut them into 1 inch segments and set them aside to toss in at the end.  I seed the tomato and toss the "guts" into the food processor with the wet ingredients, and toss the leftover outside wedges of the tomato into the salad at the end, as well.  Fresh thai chilis work the best, but remember that you can adjust the heat by not adding all of the peppers' seeds.  If your resulting salad is "ring of fire" hot, just add a bit more sugar to cut the heat.
6159	779	My estimation is that 2 cups of shredded papaya is about the right proportion for this recipe. Best to use a mandolin board that can properly julienne the fruit into long thin matchsticks, but if all you have is a kitchen grater, use that large holes on the grater and try to get the shreds as long as possible. Easy on the fish sauce. It is very powerful, you may want to start out with half the amount shown and add more if desired. Not everyone is crazy about this flavor, even though it is authentic. I find that cashews work better than peanuts. Also about 5 cherry or grape tomatoes work better than a big tomato. Cut them into halves for bite sized pieces.  In most cases, the flavor of a cherry or grape tomato is fuller, fresher, and riper than the bigger ones, at least if you are buying them and not growing your own. For truly authentic texture and taste, bruise the beans a bit. Mortar and pestle are good for this, or you can make do with a rolling pin. Just a slight bruising to release the flavor, since the beans don't get cooked.   If made authentically, it will be hot, but feel free to step down the peppers if your palate prefers less heat. Use thai peppers if possible, or serranos.
6160	780	This is wonderful on the side or on porkchops. We did not have a ripe avocado but threw in sliced grapes on a whim. This was our only change made to the original recipe.
6161	780	The wife said it was an excellent salsa (I had never used Papaya before)...refreshing. I squeezed a lime, added minced celery, apple, and a 4.5 oz can of chopped green chilies.
6162	780	Loved this.
6163	780	loved this recipe! did eliminate the cilantro (not my favorite thing) and used orange champagne vinegar just because I had
6164	780	Pretty good stuff! Since avocados, papayas, and mangos are often purchased in different sizes, it would have been helpful having the ingredients measured out rather than just identified. Although a bit challenging getting the ingredients in the correct proportions,  a lot of tasting took care of that. I liked the salsa very much and have already used it on fish and tacos.
6165	780	I substituted lemon/lime juice for vinegar, added avocado too - this was SO INCREDIBLY DELISH!!!  Pairs very well with shrimp fajitas!
6166	780	Added juice of two limes, pinch of fleur de sel, and finely diced jalapeño. Served as salso on baked halibut. Yum! :)
6167	780	Awesome salsa! Even my guy loved it and he usually isn't a fan of anything too healthy ??
6168	780	bursting with flavor even without having to let stand for 30 minutes! I added extra balsalmic vinegar (since I love it lol) and stuck to rest of the recipe, will make this over and over again
6169	781	I used cantaloupe, it was awesome!!!
6170	781	The flavor was just not enjoyable. That’s a personal preference. I did make it how it was supposed to be. It was bitter like the papaya.
6171	781	I put almond extract instead of vanilla!
6172	781	This was sooo good. I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving and got an 8 oz drink.  I used mangos that I had previously frozen so I omitted the ice and I used Truvia instead of the sugar. Yummy, I will make this often.
6173	782	Made myself a papaya smoothie too...https://www.clickasnap.com/i/qbqiwxh9hobduceb
6174	782	I used a frozen banana and almond milk. The frozen banana worked as the ice replacement. I didn't have any strawberries to add and it didn't need sugar. I was great tasting! I will try with strawberries next time, but if you want to avoid a trip to town you use what you have on hand and in this case it worked out really good.
6175	782	awesome recipe
6176	782	It was yucky.  first time having papaya and I think I'm just not a big fan of the flavor
6177	782	This was very good.  Even my 7 year old who I cannot get to eat fruit, loved this.
6178	782	YUM and GUILT FREE!
6179	782	I made this as directed except I used 3 Truvia packets in place of the sugar and I used a frozen banana. It was great!
6180	782	I had bought this huge papaya thing from Walmart and I just wanted to add more fruit to the diet so it was a Mexican papaya and I used the whole thing. It was simple and good so that was cool.
6181	782	Used blueberries instead of strawberries, and added a fruit juice blend instead of the milk.  Oh, keep a banana in the freezer for this - it really makes it great!
6182	783	Great recipe ! Delicious! Substituted Siracha and cayenne pepper for the hot chili paste
6183	783	Great recipe, we make tuna steaks quite often.  I followed the recipe with no changes.  My husband and I both though this was a very flavorful variation.
6184	783	Tuna Steaks were great! Try to flip the streaks on the grill as little as possible to keep the nuts from falling off. The salsa was really good too but isn't needed. The steaks are great by themselves!
6185	783	Made this dish and it was wonderful!  The nuttiness of the macadamia nuts was very interesting contrast to the Papaya salsa.  I had never used Papaya for salsa before and it was very good.  I added some cumin and used 2 cloves of Garlic.  My Girl friend loved it also!
6186	783	Disappointed. Not a good grill dish.
6292	802	making sushi is fun and not very hard
6190	784	Great flavor but I could not get it to set up correctly.  It would not bake through.   Very mushy inside at recommended cooking time.  I let it cook 15 minutes more, still mushy inside. I think next time I make this I will use the recipe as a filling for a crunch.  The way It turned out will make a good cobbler and heat it up with ice cream on top.  Oh and I did not add the Guava neuter.  It seemed to runny as it was.  Maybe my papaya was too mushy from the start.
6191	785	This was really good! I was surprised at how good and simple it was. This does not do very well as a leftover / after being refrigerated. It just kind of droops and becomes a bit squishy. Still tastes good, but not as good as it was fresh!
6192	785	Very good.  For my tastes, next time I'll double the red pepper and red/green onions.
6193	785	Catered a mixer with this recipe. They had a very small budget ad I was looking for a recipe which was low on cost but still impressive. Bruschetta usually fits the bill for those requirements but I wanted to do something a little different than the norm. This worked perfectly, guests loved it, great for summertime serving. I doubled the recipe but only used 5 tomatoes. I think if you used the full amount the flavor of the papaya would have been overwhelmed.
6194	785	This is a fantastic recipe!  I have made it many times now and my family and friends love it.  I add avacados which is good for more color and tastes good.  Thanks so much for this recipe!
6195	785	The original idea is a good one, but like many others I modified a bit. I don't eat processed or cooked food much, so I used a good quality organic olive oil, no sugar (addictive and highly processed), lettuce instead of bread (I am still looking for a good raw bread substitute and lettuce don't get soggy), and added dates to sweeten the sauce. It is true that a ripe papaya can make all the difference. Choose one that is mostly yellow, soft but not mushy, and heavy. Fresh ingredients are always best! I used basil, tomato and papaya from my garden. With these adjustments, it was wonderful!
6196	785	I HATE papaya, but we got some beautiful papayas as part of a Harry & David gift and I didn't want to waste them. This was surprisingly good! The tomato and vinegar offset the sweetness nicely. I recommend starting with no sugar, but add gradually to taste. I was also very unsure of what the papaya seeds would add-- I didn't know you could eat them. Our learning: yes, they're great as used here, but don't eat them alone! ;-) My daughter & I each crunched one before adding to the recipe. Don't try this at home. A little like crunching a black peppercorn. But in the blender as part of the dressing, they add a very unusual peppery flavor, like cracked pepper. For those who had problems with watery-ness: brush your baguette slices with a touch of olive oil (or spray lightly) and bake 5 min so they're good & crunchy, and definitely drain the salsa before spooning on. Thanks for a unique, light app that will be used several times this summer!
6197	785	This was really yummy.  I am going to rate it 5 stars even though I changed an ingredient (ok two). I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used strawberry vinegrette and I used olive oil instead.  Even if I would have followed it, it would have been just as yummy- so try it!
6198	785	Excellent; I used half the sugar and drained before serving and it was perfect.  I halved the recipe and still had plenty for 8 people, unless this were a whole meal I think the portions are a bit off.  Would be great with mango too instead of the papaya.
6199	785	This is fabulous.  It bugs me when people rate recipes but have essentially changed the original, but I must admit that I subbed mango for the papaya because that's what I had.  It was wonderful on bread BUT the next day we had it with grilled salmon!  Amazing combination!
6200	786	Delicious! I added strawberries and some shredded coconut for texture. A squeeze of lime and it was good!!
6201	786	Simple and delicious!  I like the addition of the banana. They balance out the tartness from the pineapple and mango.  I'm not normally a huge fan of papaya, but it's very good mixed with the other fruits. I think next time I might sprinkle some coconut over the top. Great recipe!
6202	787	Delicious, not too sweet. The sweetness is just right! Refreshing, and smells good too. I used grapefruit zest. Give it a try!
6203	787	Amazing flavor, yet not overwhelming at all. Only used about half the amount of water called for. I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in this and made creamcicle like floats. =^.^= Tasty.
6204	787	This is absolutely delicious! Great combination of fruits, very tropical. I increased the amount of fruit, used frozen mango, and only used 1/3 cup of water just because I prefer thick smoothies. No need to add any sugar. Thanks for the recipe!
6205	788	rating 3 stars because I don't know how to shred a green papaya easily. I need that procedure to make the recipe complete.
6206	788	This salad is delicious and just like they make it in HAWAII....  If you buy a papaya from the grocery store they usually are already having  color inside so if you have an Asian market nearby, ask for the papaya salad.... papaya because they will be green inside and what you want.  You can also buy a shredding tool that is less than $10.00 and it makes your salad perfect.  LOVE THIS RECIPE
6207	789	Just followed directions. Refreshing great with hot or salty flavors.
6208	789	Wow, this is awesome!  I used Greek yogurt and really liked the mixture of the tart yogurt and sweet fruit.  This dish is also great for texture-- you get crunchy nuts, smooth yogurt, soft fruit, and chewy raisins.  Yum!
6209	789	Yum! I happened to have a small, ripe hawaiian papaya on hand along with greek yogurt. Put the nuts on top and it was great!
6210	789	This was a wonderful dish. Everyone in the family loved it. I make my own yogurt which isn't as thick as store bought so I diced up the papaya and poured the mixture over the top. I also didn't have any raisins so I used dried cranberries. I will be making this again!
6211	789	I used a very lg papaya & served half of it to two people. I added a bit of vanilla to my yogurt & I used dried cherries instaed of raisins & fresh blueberries instead of strawberries. Wsa a very light & refreshing dessert...thansk for the recipe! Forgot to add that we grilled this for just long enough to get some cool grill marks.
6212	789	Its a very good alternative to a pineapple version. And very tasty too. I like this recipe alot!
6213	790	This is very similar to how we usually eat papaya (with lime juice and honey). The addition of balsamic vinegar scared me a bit, so I cut that back to just a sprinkle (probably more like 1 tsp). It wasn't that noticeable, so maybe it would have been fine with the entire amount, but I was afraid it would ruin it for us. I did add some toasted coconut on top, and garnished it with fresh mint. Very pretty and refreshing. I'd gladly serve this to dinner guests.
6243	794	Light, refreshing and very colorful. I subbed mango for the papaya due to personal preference, and like others, I blanched the green beans. I thought there was a little something missing flavor-wise - maybe some ginger? - but all in all it was pretty good!
6214	791	I was skeptical in making  this recipe.  Instead of  putting 1 cup of cold cooked corn and 1 red pepper. I bought frozen Birdseye - lightly seasoned southwestern corn bag (2/3 cup serving) and microwaved it. I let it cool down then did the recipe as it was written. It came out delicious. Make it, you won't regret it.
6215	791	Family of seven....not one liked it.
6216	791	I live near all of the ethnic markets listed above and couldn't find a green papaya so I diced up a ripe one. The brown sugar adds a nice touch to a great salad.
6217	792	Fantastic!
6218	792	I made some changes, but the chicken was very bland. Papaya is not a strong enough flavor to do all the work here.  If I made it again, I would definitely add salt and probably other spices.
6219	792	This was suprisingly delicious.  I went a lil heavy on cinn. and cayenne because I like a lil extra heat.  That cinn. was strong... oops.  Everything was perfectly timed and couldn't be happier.  Thanks for the recipe.
6220	792	I made the sauce to pour over drums and rice (because I didn't have breast on hand, and we are Gluten Free). The sauce was excellent. I didn't have nutmeg, so I added ginger instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. Still excellent, gave it a very tropical Pacific Islands flavor. I think it would even bee good with yellow curry. Great idea.
6221	792	What a super yummy dish!  I used butter instead of margarine, crushed red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and regular rice instead of basmati.  Other than these minor changes I followed the recipe.  It was very easy (I did use toothpicks to pin the chicken breasts shut).  It was a longer process than a normal dinner but worth it.  Full of wonderful flavors, I'm looking forward to leftovers!
6222	792	I picked some papaya from my new home's garden, and had no idea what to do with it.  Wonderful recipe, but the sauce was especially AMAZING!  Can't wait to make it again.
6223	792	Wonderful melding of sweet & savory.  We really liked it.
6224	792	Absolutely delish! We all loved it! I was out of nutmeg so I used allspice which gave it a nice "apple pie" flavour. The only complaint is the chicken is really difficult to cook after breading. I think next time I'll brown the chicken first and then immediately bread to see if that works better.
6225	792	This is right out of any classic Cuban cookbook.  The mixture of sweet and spicy is wonderful.  If you like this recipe, I urge you to look into Cuban cooking.  Its not firey hot like the rest of Carribean cooking and the flavors are fantastic.
6226	793	Wow what a unique taste.  Put some chicken breast on top and made a fantastic quick meal.
6227	793	The first time I made it, I was in a hurry so I didn't candy the almonds. I was a great lunch salad. The second time, I did candy the almonds, and it does add to the salad. I decided it needed something else, so I added some chopped red onion and grape tomatoes. These additions made it even better.
6228	793	The flavors of this salad were amazing!  Great textures, especially enjoyed the candied almonds.  This will be a great accompaniment to grilled chicken in the future.   Thanks for sharing!
6229	793	This was so refreshing.  We had this as a side salad for dinner, but I could see this with a sandwich at lunch.  The "dressing" was an unexpected surprise.  I was concerned that it would have a strange taste, but the balsamic vinegar added just the right tartness to balance out sweetness of the fruit.
6230	793	Fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of either mango or papaya, but this blew me away!
6231	793	Fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of either mango or papaya, but this blew me away!
6232	793	This isn't just a side salad, as yes, it could be. It can also be a hot summer day meal, a desert, or a tasty snack. When canding almonds always stir through the whole cooking time, then they won't burn. I thought this was good enough to put on my new resturant menu. Koodoo's to the cook!
6233	793	This was very healthy and light and decent, but not spectacular.  I figure that the salad is only as good as the ripeness of the fruits.  Unusual combination of fruits though, considering avocado season is in the winter, so I couldn't get all my fruits ripe at the same time.  I candied almonds using only white sugar and heating them in a NONSTICK pan (very important). Then I let them cool on GREASED wax paper.  Not sure I'll make this salad again.
6234	793	I really wanted to like this.  And it was good.  However, "sugaring" the almonds was tricky, burnt them on the first try. watch the amount of butter.  also the dressing, though good, is heavy. do NOT put on until just before serving. after that, doesn't take long for the fruits to turn into mush. also the prep time on this has got to be wrong. 15 minutes? took me that long to do the mango and papaya and get them in the blender for the dressing.  55 minutes, although I did use an extra mango. still way off. I gave it 3 stars because it took too long, was expensive and not a light summer salad as I thought.
6235	794	I have made this twice now and my husband and I both really like it.  I do believe I will blanch the green beans and maybe try it with some peanut butter in the sauce.  I served it with blackened tuna and we both thought it went very well together.
6236	794	Excellent - I couldn't stop eating it, thanks for sharing. I look forward to making it with varied fruits.
6237	794	I was really surprised how well I liked this simple salad.  My BF on the other hand wouldn't want to eat it again ever
6238	794	TRY THIS!!  Not sure what made me since it is so unusual, perhaps that I was making south beach coconut chicken and they seemed to make sense together.  But when it came time to make and eat it we were really nervous.  It was delicious!!  So fresh and flavorful.  Not sure what fish sauce is (I am the sister of a chef, so I get to be all kinds of ignorant when it comes to food since that is her job!), but it is not what I thought it was, i.e. strongly fishy tasting.  Only change I made was to blanch the green beans for a few minutes before putting them in ice water.  Just didn't want raw green beans - call me wimpy if you want.  My papaya seemed to be from Mexico and was pinker than the one in the picture, if that matters.  Luscious, luscious, luscious and ridiculously healthful.  Thanks taddy, will be making again and again. (Oh, and it did actually go great with the SB coconut chicken)
6239	794	Wonderful veggie salad
6240	794	This was so yummy!  We just got back from Thailand and loved all the great food.  I added mango instead of papaya (taste preference) and I also added sweet red peppers and used cashews because that was all I had.  I cannot stop eating this salad!  Thanks for the great recipe.
6241	794	Very nice sauce.  I'm sorry to say it turns out I don't like papaya, but that's not your fault!  I love mango though so will try with that next time.
6242	794	I make this salad very often these days. Instead of cubing the papayas though, I slice it very thinly. Also, I add chunky peanut butter to the sauce which gives incredible rich peanut flavor!
6293	802	Great recipe, thank you!
6294	802	amazing!
6244	795	the  title says " spicy", but we found it rather bland.. not sure if the recipe is missing something. we added 1 Tbs of Liquid Smoke, which really brought out the papaya flavor and added the rest of the papaya. we also used country ribs, which cooked faster than the 1 1/2 hrs. my son was not impressed but my husbamd ans I enjoyed it, but not sure I would make it again
6245	795	I thought this was just ok; my husband enjoy it more then I did. I would not make it again sorry to say.
6246	795	I love spice. It runs through my family. THIS TASTE SO GOOD!! :D
6247	796	I have been looking for a smoothie recipe to use my papaya in and this is my favorite.  I love this.  I had to make 2 changes because I didn't have condensed milk or vanilla yogurt.  I used plain yogurt instead and used 1 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup whipping cream.
6248	796	I was a bit hesitant to try this smoothie after seeing the other review, but actually think it's quite tasty and refreshing.  I did not make it exactly as the recipe, however,  I did not use the sweetened condensed milk because I do not care for the taste unless it's in a baked product, nor did I use the cream cheese.  I used Del Monte SunFresh papaya (jarred), whole milk, plain yogurt, vanilla extract, lime juice and honey.  I would make this smoothie again with my changes.  Thank you for the new idea for using papaya!
6249	796	I did not care for this smoothie.
6250	797	Super cute! I did not have papaya but used pineapple for the fin and cantaloupe for the mouth (you can barely see in the photo). You can use any fruit your kid will eat. My grumpy daughter who claimed she wasn't hungry immediately gobbled it up when she saw it.
6251	798	Loved it! SO easy to make too!!
6252	798	Delicious and very filling
6253	798	Perfection.
6254	798	Made this for my parents. we all really enjoyed it!
6255	798	Turned out really good substitute of the blue cheese for feta and served with sliced cherry tomatoes to
6256	798	I switched Iceberg for Spinach and Romaine.  The rest of the ingredients weren't bad
6257	798	Easier way to make bacon:
6258	798	Made this with the exception of blue cheese (used cheddar instead).
6259	798	I made this salad as directed, except for the avocado. It’s winter time now in Michigan, so I couldn’t get a decent one if I tried. I also made my own ranch dressing from the site, the Ranch Dressing ll. This was really good and just what I was craving. Thanks for putting the recipe together!
6260	799	Simple yet tasty
6261	799	Good concept but a little bland. I agree needs something to make it pop. And very messy to eat so next time - when experimenting with seasonings - will slightly mash the avocado to make a better “bed” for the egg. I like this idea! Will make again with some tweaks. Thanks Tricia for some new breakfast inspiration.
6262	799	What a hit for our Easter Sunday breakfast! Easy to make as directed,  If made for just husband and I, would use only one egg.
6263	799	I usually don’t like avocado, but this sandwich  tastes delicious. I only had mozarela cheese, it’s what I used.
6264	799	Loved it! The teenager loves it as well. I’ve made it with one and two eggs and used whatever cheese is in the fridge. Also another great way to eat avocado. Thanks for the recipe!!
6265	799	The recipe is great but I made a couple changes for our tastes. I changed to only 1 egg and I added a strip of thick bacon cut in half so there were 2 rows of bacon. When removing the fried egg from the pan I placed it on the cooked bacon so it was easy to pickup and put on top of the Swiss cheese. Delicious breakfast and so easy to make.
6266	799	Excellent sandwich and filling as well! The subtle blend of flavors made this  5-star restaurant possibility!
6267	799	i used an English muffin instead of bread, which wasn't the greatest idea, and its hard to cut/eat, but still very tasty and will try again with whole grain bread, thx:
6268	799	Made the eggs over easy, and substituted white cheddar and muenster cheeses. Also used white bread. Came out delicious, if a bit messy to flip and to eat!
6269	800	This recipe is really good and has bright flavors. So good!
6270	800	I make this often and always switch it up. My family loves it.
6271	800	Always a  hit.  I like this version because the taco seasoning is mixed into the sour cream.
6272	800	I made this for an after work get together. There wasn’t any left. Super easy to make. Definitely a keeper.
6273	800	Followed exactly and this is the best! We all loved it.
6274	800	Beautiful
6275	800	My family and I loved it! We used greek yogurt, instead of sour cream, and green olives since those are what we had on hand and it was still SUPER TASTY! Thank you for the recipe!
6276	800	It was great even though I didn't have the ripest avocados.  Next time I'll make sure to shop better.  I also added diced red onions and jalapenos to the veggies on top.  Very good!
6277	800	Everyone loved it!  My favorite 7 layer dip that I have made.  I forgot to buy taco seasoning, so I had to make my own.  This was delicious!
6278	801	I made this recipe exactly as written and loved it.  This smooth, creamy smoothie has a sweet taste despite the savory flavor of the avocado.  One could easily mistake this smoothie for a dessert.  If your kids like the individual ingredients and can get past the light green color, like my son did, they will enjoy this, too.
6279	801	Delicious, creamy, and refreshing
6280	801	I love this smoothie, I did add some lemon and lime juice and a little agava longside the honey.
6281	801	Replaced honey a with a frozen banana for sweeting (like I saw in another recipe) and added some spinach to the mix. It was delicious. Everybody at home liked it. I wish I had done more.
6282	801	Omgggg this was sooo good. I followed the recipe exactly and it’s soooooo creamy. It took a short time to make and I def recommend it.
6283	801	Instead of milk, I used coconut milk and half the amount of honey. Very yummy and now also vegan.
6284	801	I thought it was good but I couldn't really taste the avacado. I would have liked to taste the avacado in it too
6285	801	Waaay too much honey and not sure the vanilla yogurt helped. Didn't at all taste very much of avocado. Will not be making this one again.
6286	801	Really delicious! Perfect amount of yogurt. Next time, I will probably only do 2 tbsp of honey (too sweet for me). I also added some quick oats to give it some texture.
6287	802	delishus
6288	802	i love this sushi!
6289	802	Even though the mat-rolling part was a bit difficult, it was fun and delicious!
6295	802	I've never made sushi before and this is an excellent recipe. I had no idea there is rice vinegar, sugar and salt mixed with the rice. We used avocado, cucumber, mango, shrimp and imitation crab to make a variety of rolls. I'll try adding cream cheese and thin carrot sticks in the future. My only issue was that there was not enough rice for 4 nori sheets. Other recipes also mention to leave a 1/2'' gap at the top of the nori sheet to help with rolling it up, which I will try next time. Great recipe and the family loved them.
6296	803	This is basically chunky guacamole, but still good. Unless you use jumbo avocados I think the amount of onion and bell would still be too much and take away from the avocado, so just add what you like. I used red onion and an orange bell because Hubbs isn't a fan of green. For us, extra cilantro always! I had leftover grilled corn so threw that in as well. Great salad, used the leftovers on breakfast tacos!
6297	803	I love this salad! I double it. I add 4 ears of fresh corn, cut off the cob. A jalapeño if I have one, red pepper instead of green, a container of cherry tomatoes, and a little minced garlic. Heavy on the cilantro. Delicious.
6298	803	Delicious, fresh salad. I love the blend of the avocado and tomato, with some zest from the onion.
6299	803	Scrumptious summer side dish, also delicious as the topping on crusty bread/bruschetta.
6300	803	My husband loved this!
6301	803	Delicious as side with chips to chicken tomatillo enchiladas. I used jalapeños because that’s the pepper I use. Will continue with this in dinner rotations. Scrumptious!
6302	803	I can get on board with any "no measurements required" recipe.  For a salad for one, and using what I had, I used one avocado, half a red onion, a handful of cherry tomatoes, juice from half a lime, bit of yellow pepper, a good splash of olive oil, S&P, and I added some crumbled feta, because cheese.  DELICIOUS.
6303	803	yummy fresh and light. I did make a few changes, used a poblano instead of green pepper, added a small English Cucumber sliced, used about 10 cherry/grape tomatoes of different colors, love cilantro and used it fresh from my garden,used a whole avocado and 2 tbsp of lime juice.
6304	803	This salad is so refreshing, I used cherry tomatoes and was even more delicious, I mad it for the fourth time now
6305	804	Used maple syrup instead of sugar and added a little coconut oil to help mask the "green" flavor. Melted dark chocolate and poured over and let it harden. Added a raspberry as a topper. Delish.
6306	804	the negative reviews are probably from ripe avocados. Mine were pre-ripe but soft enough to handle and were tasteless in the recipe.  I used 2 T stevia instead of sugar, dark chocolate powder and it was awesome!
6307	804	My wife and I decided we won't make any other kind of chocolate pudding. It is amazing! Also is great way to get omegas down our kids that refuse avocados because of the texture.After reading through some of the reviews it is obvious you need to be very careful about the ripeness of the avocados you use. An underripe or hard avocado will produce a grainy texture and funny taste. Ripe avocados (just gives slightly when squeezed) come out smooth with only a slight avocado flavor.We also used a higher quality coconut milk that we save to make curry with, that could also affect the end flavor because the milk is not super sweet but has a pleasant coconut flavor and mild smell. It also solidifies quickly and smoothly when chilled which would help the texture and how well this pudding sets up when refrigerated.Definitely needs to be well blended, but when done, it is perfection!The serving size seems a bit off too. Says it makes 4 servings. We found it to be so rich and satisfying that we figured it to be closer to 6 or 8 serving per batch if you can manage to stay out of it!
6308	804	Incredible! Tasted like rich dark chocolate pudding. Will make again every time I have extra avocados getting too ripe. I increased vanilla and added almond extract and left out the cinnamon. I will have to try the cinnamon version one of these days.😍😍😍.
6309	804	I only had about 1/2 an avacado so I made a much reduced recipe. I blended it for a long time and it was super smooth.
6310	804	OMG!! THIS IS SO FREAKING GOOD I AM EATING IT RIGHT NOW!! YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS THE T ASTE IS AMAZING!!!I STRAINED IT IN AN ICING  STRAINER TO MAKE IT SMOOTHER
6311	804	Ended up with grainy paste that tastes like ur eating grass uck
6312	804	nice. its delicious
6313	804	We loved it! I doubled the recipe and found it needed an entire can of coconut milk.
6314	805	This was so easy to make and so good!  I didn't have any tomatoes so I added a can of diced tomato and green chili.
6315	805	I really like this recipe. It’s so easy, but so authentic. Make it all the time!👍
6316	805	Only thing I would suggest is to refrigerate for 2 hours we ate before refrigerating and then after and was definitely different for the best
6317	805	It's quite good and was easy to make! Great for dipping chips.
6318	805	Excellent. Great taste. NO SALT added due to my restrictions. I added garlic 3 cloves.
6319	805	Great recipe ! I usually make it on a stone mortar and pestle and I swear it tastes better
6320	805	it tasted good and was easy to make
6321	805	The recipe was so good my sister and my mom made it together, it wasn't even that spicy i couldn't taste the jalapeno. Awesome recipe :)
6322	805	The only thing I might would change, is a little less lemon juice. Otherwise,  it's absolutely delicious!
6323	806	Not enough spice for true "Mexican" soup - needs peppers such as Habanero or Jalepeno, also missing lime juice
6324	806	This was excellent!!  I also added corn I took from two corn on the cob and added them with the chicken for the last 5 minutes.  So yum.
6325	806	My family loved it
6326	806	Great soup! I added black beans, about a cup of salsa and a dab of sour cream on the top when serving. Yum.
6327	806	This was verry good everyone except my granddaughter loved it I did make a few changes I only added a teaspoon of cumin and I added black beans and green chiles
6328	806	With a few modifications, this is a delicious soup.  Our family likes mild soup, so I made the following changes:  I sauted onion & celery in 2 T butter and added 2 teaspoons taco seasoning and no other spices.     I added one 14 oz  can of diced tomatoes, one 6 oz can of tomatoes  with green chiles, one can of kidney beans, one can of pinto beans, and one can of hominy in addition to the frozen corn and 48 oz chicken broth.  (I drained & rinsed all canned items prior to adding them.)  Then,  I simmered that for 20 -30 minutes and finally added rotisserie chicken that I shredded.
6329	806	Added a can of red kidney beans. My whole family loved it
6330	806	If you  like savory soups, this one is for you!!
6371	811	Very yummy.i had it with a beer sitting on my front porch, it was yum ;)
6331	806	Hi added extra avocado, extra cilantro and a little bit of lime?.  I also used a bit of fajita seasoning in addition to taco seasoning.
6332	428	Loved it. Subbed honey for sugar and didn't caramelize pecans. Everyone that I've shared it with loves it too.
6333	428	FabEverything was amazing.
6334	428	This salad is delicious!  Our new favorite salad. Ripe D Anjou pears are really good in this salad.  Made it with original blue cheese (our favorite).  Made the pecans as directed, excellent.  Will use the pecans in other salads too.  Couldn’t stop munching on them.
6335	428	Amazing. Made exactly as recipe stated. This got rave reviews from my very picky girlfriends at our annual holiday dinner. The dressing is what really makes it. Will be making for my family Christmas dinner. Thank you for sharing!
6336	428	Absolute favorite!! I’ve made & shared many times, people always love it.I often omit the cheese to make it vegan/ plant based for myself.
6337	428	I loved this salad! The flavors were absolutely perfect blended together. Yummy!!!
6338	428	Wow, the combination of flavors in this salad is amazing, especially with the dressing!  I made it without cooking the pecans in sugar and it's still delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.
6339	428	I’ve make this salad every Thanksgiving by my family’s request. I use a spring mix salad and substitute the yellow mustard for Dijon mustard. I never caramelize the pecans, just use them raw. Everyone loves it! Thanks for the recipe!
6340	428	Excellent recipe!!  Love it!!!
6341	808	Not bad, but found it a little bland with milk, I used Orange juice instead
6342	808	Amazed how nice this actually was, half a tspoon more honey for me. Will be making again
6343	808	Fully satisfying, I used Nancy's unflavored yogurt, piece of fresh ginger, banana, pineapple, avocado and spinach. Touch of honey, super yummy.
6344	808	Amazing!!!
6345	808	Just happened to have the ingredients. Used vanilla almond milk which made it nuttier and a bit sweeter. Sooo easy. Sooo good.
6346	808	Very creamy and smooth.  I used Vanilla Almond Milk but did not add Honey.  The milk and the banana was sweet enough.
6347	808	I substituted almond milk, but everything else was to the letter.  I also added a teaspoon of moringa powder, which if anything, will make a smoothie taste worse, and this tasted very good WITH the moringa powder.  That means this smoothie is really good!
6348	808	Smooth and tasty! We tried some other smoothie recipes but this is superior. Followed the recipe but I could see subbing almond milk.
6349	808	This was the first time I’ve ever had a smoothie that included avocado and it was incredible! So creamy!
6350	809	This is a great way to add healthy avocado to your diet. I just use half an avocado because that is plenty.  Of course you can adjust it with different spices etc. But I like a described and the idea gets 5 stars from me.
6351	809	Yummy 😋Scooped and mashed the flesh, Then altered it slightly in that I’d seasoned and squeezed lime juice onto the scooped flesh which I mashedPut a couple of thinly sliced pieces of garlic into the flesh which is now returned to the skins, along with some sliced chilli.Made a well in the mashed flesh, added egg and again squeezed with lime juice and seasoned the top of the egg againUsed a microwave for 90seconds, which can be adjusted to avoid snotty whites and both the taste and texture was sumptuous. You can add bacon on top aswell but don’t season a second time with salt as it’s too much
6352	809	First, be sure to use size small eggs-otherwise you will need to scoop out so much avocado.
6353	809	Pretty good! I did it in the airfryer since it was only for me. only do for 10 mins if you want your eggs runny. Also I added some bacon and it was perfect. Love it !
6354	809	I didn't grow up eating avocados but, as an adult, have acquired a taste for slices on sandwiches and guacamole with chips. I really thought this would be great, but discovered I don't care for warm avocados. A disappointing discovery about myself.
6355	809	I skipped the chives & bacon, since I didn't have them,  topping with tarragon & paprika instead. Very tasty.
6356	809	Fast and easy. I added a quick 2 minute broil to the end to finish the eggs.
6357	809	We didn’t care for it.  No taste for us, but others may enjoy it.
6358	809	I've made this a few times and both my wife and I agree that it's pretty good.  BUT!  I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it is a  bit lacking in the flavor test.  So, I changed it up just a bit and  we both agree that it really is a terrific upgrade.  Here is what I did --
6359	810	My family loves this recipe
6360	810	This recipe is amazing and my children loved it.
6361	810	I’m allergic to all things fish and shellfish so I was so happy at our favorite japanese place I found out they had these and even happier when I tried them and they were amazing. These were just as good. I put more filling than instructed but not so much it would break. It looked more like the ones I get there.
6362	810	Love this roll. very easy.
6363	810	Half the amount of rice vinegar
6364	810	I added in some carrot shreds, as well as some sugar snap peas, and it was delicious!
6365	810	I made this sushi and it was fabulous! I didn't have sushi rice OR rice vinegar. Instead, I used regular white rice and white vinegar and the sushi rolls turned out just fine; I loved them. I will make these again! I'm a vegetarian, my parents aren't so I did add imitation crab to half of my sushi batch for my parents. I also noticed that I didn't have enough rice cooked for 4 sheets of nori to be filled and the last one wasn't fully stuffed like the others. Next time, I'll make more rice! Overall, I love this so so much!!
6366	810	YUMMY!!!!!! My sister and I made these with Perfect Sushi Rice from this site. We did 2 California Rolls...with the imatation crab, cucumber (we used an English cuke), avacado. We also did 2 rolls with fresh Yellowfin Tuna from the fish dept. of our food store. This tuna was so fresh and mild...tasted like butter. Excellent! The tuna rolls we also added the cukes and avacado. We found our Nori seaweed in the Asian section of our food store....no problem. Served with wasabi and low sodium soy. Also made Japanese Soup with Tofu and Mushooms from this site and Vegetarian Dumplings from Alton Brown on Food Network for a complete meal. Thanks!
6367	810	I agree with others here, I felt intimidated about making sushi until I saw this recipe and decided to go for it. It is super easy! I marinated my cucumber in soy sauce, rice vinegar, and fresh ginger. I also added tofu. And embarrassingly, cream cheese! Ok, I'm white, I like cream cheese in my sushi! :)
6368	811	If your tortilla comes out sticky add more flower the recipe did not add enough.
6369	811	es lo mas delicioso en la vida
6373	811	Maybe I'm just an idiot, but I put the ingredients and the correct measurements in for the dough and it turned into a liquid. I had to add two extra cups of flour before it even came close to being solid enough to work with. Not really impressed with this recipe
6374	811	I’ve been trying to make these for so long and I couldn’t. They either stick or were too hard but this recipe is the one and it tastes delicious.
6375	811	This was unexpectedly quick and delicious. I happened to have leftover brisket and I chopped it finely and added to the mix. This made for a quick and filling late breakfast ?? early lunch ??. I used hot sauce and husband topped with salsa verse. He loved it and I think kids would enjoy it too.
6376	811	It came out great, and I agree with other posters with it needing at least 2 more cups of flour for the tortillas to take form.
6377	812	I have had better cooked by the lime and lemon
6378	812	Made exactly as written. It was a hit with everyone!  Thank you so much!  This will be my new potluck addition.
6379	812	I always get this when I go to Mexican restaurant - I had no idea it was so easy to make!   Next time I'm going to try it with scallops.  I don't serve it with saltines - I bake my own "cips" from naan  in the oven.  I like a softer chip.
6380	812	SOOO GOOD!!! I used all the ingredients except for horseradish since I didn’t have it on hand.  I also added tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, Serrano chili’s and sriracha and lots more clamato.  You won’t regret trying this one!!
6381	812	My husband loved it! Said it was better than a restaurant's. I didn't change anything. I think it came out great.
6382	812	This was a Delicious recipe, except I added 3 cucumber. A dash of Valentina.I also added a dash of Worcester sauce to mine. It was amazing. I use to work in a Mexican restaurant and there secret ingredient was Orange Fanta soda, crazy right? Maybe that was why it was so addictive to consume.
6383	812	This was delicious.  The only change that I made was that I used a spicy Bloody Mary mix rather than Clamato juice.  It was the perfect meal on a hot, humid summer day.
6384	812	Super tasty and easy! Thanks for sharing!
6385	812	I remember having this in the little fishing village of San Felipe in Baja, California Norte, Mexico in the early 1960's. It took me right back to the beach! I will definitely make it again.
6386	813	I didn't care for it because it really IS NOT sweet as you'd think! I made a double & wish I'd not. :/I make smoothies all the time & adding strawberries didn't help.Bland!
6387	813	It was really good and really nutritious. Loved it!!!
6388	813	I added 3/4 cup of milk because I think it would be too watery for me, personal preference. Wayy too sweet, would recommend to put one tablespoon first and adjust to preference. First time i made it it was so sweet that i can barely taste the avocado. However,overall, great recipe !! Thank you for the great recipe!!
6389	813	I used a frozen banana and cashew milk.  I didn't measure anything, just kind of dumped the ingredients in the blender.
6390	813	It's okay. Great for St. Patty's Day.
6391	813	This is a great 'Run out of the door' kind of shake!! I've made it more times than I can count, I use either Cashew or Coconut milk unsweetened and no honey and still enjoy!!
6392	813	This recipe was delicious are used one avocado and one frozen banana and filled up enough Allmond milk to make one cup and only 1 teaspoon of honey perfect
6393	813	Very tasty but a bit too sweet for me. My banana was frozen and I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk. I think next time I will cut back on the honey. I should have known better since I always wait until my bananas are more black than yellow when I freeze them.
6394	813	Yummy. Even my picky son loved it! Add chia seeds to it for more protein.
6395	814	This runs a close second and even better than any Tex mex restaurants around me!  This has become a household favorite any time we do Mexican food.  I took some of the others comments to add a little onion & garlic.  I also juice the half of  lime in a separate glass & add sparingly as I’m mixing because it can be too much lime with a half squeezed lime otherwise & it does take away from it.  I grow tomatillos in my spring & fall garden & never waste any of them (or give any away)now that I found this recipe!
6396	814	It’s excellent just as it is, but of course we all have our taste preferences. I added some garlic. I usually quadruple the recipe because my family eats it so fast. This tastes exactly like the tomatillo salsa at Los Cabos in Jenks, Oklahoma.
6397	814	Loved the creaminess the avocado brought, super good! I cut the Serrano into less than half and there was still a nice slow burn.
6398	814	I used jalapenos and omitted the cilantro and it was delicious. Put it on roast beef sliders and use on nachos chips. Can't stand cilantro so...Added a little black pepper.
6399	814	I've made this recipe 4 different times now. Sometimes I add more serrano chiles because we like things hot! if I don't have lime juice I use lemon juice.
6400	814	great recipe! i  was a touch short on cilantro but still had enough to make it work.
6401	814	I found the secret recipe for my favorite local Mexican restaurant!
6402	814	Super easy and very tasty!
6403	814	Easy tweaks to make this better. Blanch the tomatillos, onion, and Chili's for about 4-5 minutes first before for processing. when combining, use the juice of a full lime to taste.
6404	815	Very tasty salsa.  I did not make any changes to the recipe any brought it to a party.  I received many compliments.  Thanks for sharing.  I’ll definitely make again
6405	815	This is my go to mango salsa! Only change I made was using a jalapeño pepper. We served it with grilled snapper. It’s also delicious on tortilla chips
6406	815	Followed the recipe. Everyone loved it.
6407	815	Didn’t have limes, used lemon instead. Also used dried cilantro. Was an amazing accompaniment to mahi mahi with rice. Was AWESOME mixed with the rice. Tried it with tortilla chips too!  If it’s a hit with picky teenage daughter then it gets huge thumbs up from me!!!  This will be a staple in our house from now on and soooooo healthy!!
6408	815	I am in love with this salsa. My husband and I can’t have enough of it.
6409	815	Friends and family keep asking for the recipe! So easy and quick to prepare!  I make it a few hours before serving, cover in Saran Wrap, I leave in the fridge for all the flavours to marry!  Delicious
6410	815	Be sure your mango and avocado are both just barely ripe. You need a firm fruit or you get a slimy mess (That was my rookie mistake). That said, the recipe is excellent. I soaked the red onion to mellow the flavor and used serrano peppers [because they are in my garden ;) ] This is a go to side for Pork Carnitas.
6414	816	being Latino i love avocado but my girlfriend being a pinay(i think thats what its called) loves it, so i decided to give it the old college try. i didn't have any milk on hand so i used condensed milk since that's what i had and it was amazing i love it!
6415	816	So very good! I scaled it down to 1 serving (1/2 avocado), and it was the perfect amount. I skipped the ice but added a small frozen banana and used the lime juice. It was thick, so I had to add more milk. Even then, it was still a little thick, but not icy-thick.....a nice creamy, smooth thick. Good way to use up avocados. Thanks for the recipe!
6416	816	Delicious. I used about half the sugar specified and they tasted great. But if you've got a sweet tooth...
6417	816	Me and my friend made it and it was really gross. We couldn’t even finish it.
6418	816	I has surgery on my stomach and had to be on a very soft diet for over a month.  This milkshake helped me keep my sanity.  I followed the directions but it was too thin, the reason for only 4 starts, so added an extra scoop of ice cream and it was perfect (5 starts).   I used it as my main drink for my protein and vitamin power.
6419	816	Super good. I have also used coconut milk in one I made and that is really good. Think maybe my favorite.
6420	816	I made an avocado milkshake today for the first time and it's amazing!
6421	816	I made some changes to the recipe and it was still very good. I used Splenda instead of sugar, forgot the lemon juice and I substituted cottage cheese for the ice cream (because I am counting calories). I bet if I make it with ice cream it will be even better! UPDATE: I just made this again with ice cream instead of the cottage cheese, soy milk, Splenda and lime juice and it is DELICIOUS!!  Thanks for the recipe.
6422	817	So yummy
6423	817	Husband did the grocery shopping and forgot the red bell pepper so I substituted with cucumber. He also unknowingly bought a red chili pepper instead of a jalapeno. All worked out. He loves his salsa and loved this recipe!
6424	817	Wonderful summer salad/salsa. Love that the lime juice keeps the avocados green! I once had a version made with black eyed peas called Cowboy caviar, but I lost the recipe. This is every bit as good, and the black, red, green and yellow colors look great together.
6425	817	Made with scallions instead of red onions.  Equally as good.
6426	817	I’ve made this several times for get togethers and it is always a hit. The only change is cutting back on cilantro because of friends that aren’t fans.  This one is definitely a keeper!
6427	817	I’ve been making this recipe for years and love it. We eat it as a side dish. Recipe is very forgiving if you prefer more or less of an ingredient. I go easy on the cilantro.
6428	817	Very refreshing and different from the usual, I know this will be one of my favorites
6429	817	Absolutely fantastic combination of fresh flavors. I used apple cider vinegar and also added some heat with a few shakes of bottled hot sauce. I could literally eat this with a spoon straight from the bowl. Takes a lot of time to cut up all those veggies, but totally worth it. Thanks for a great recipe!
6430	817	Excellent! The only thing that I did differently, was instead of red pepper(I had no peppers), was to chop a cucumber up instead.
6431	818	I loved this recipe. We did not use the dressing it called for as we served to to our very picky teen boy but he ate all of it and did not complain about avocado and tomato that he normally complains about!! Yay!!
6432	818	This was a great dinner salad.  I did substitute toasted sunflower seeds for the pine nuts.  And used crumbled Feta Cheese instead of goat cheese.   DELICIOUS!   Shared with my family and friends too.  :)
6433	818	It was delicious! This is without the dressing but I made the dressing on the side. That was delicious too!
6434	818	The dressing is very good which I made as stated.  It really makes it.  Unfortunately I didn’t have all of the other ingredients so made some substitutions, but still good.  I will make again.
6435	818	Excellent salad!  The pine nuts pair well with the avocado and the goat cheese enhances the flavor.
6436	818	I loved it! I did 'customize' it a bit, tho. I had some leftover grilled salmon which I used in lieu of chicken - I've always liked salmon & spinach together. I tossed in a few slices of red onion, a bit of fresh dill, & added probably 1/2 tsp sugar to the dressing, for a more 'sweet & sour' profile. Would definitely make it again.
6437	818	Loved this recipe! I left out the pine nuts due to allergies and added some homemade garlic croutons for the crunch factor. Oh, and a few beets sliced too. Simply deliish!!
6438	818	This was so delicious! I used organic baby spinach! I marinated the chicken in a mixture of Teriyaki Sauce and Italian dressing for an hour before baking in the marinade! Even my meat-loving husband LOVED IT!
6439	818	Excellent. I didn’t have goat cheese so used feta. The dressing was delicious. Will Mae this again.
6440	819	easy to make and always yummy.
6441	819	I made this and I don’t get why the oil is used at all or why lemons instead of limes. And no cilantro?! There are better recipes guacamole.
6442	819	This recipe is easy and yummy with the minimum ingredients. Next time I’ll add cilantro but it’s great without.
6443	819	I used just under 1 tbsp of lemon juice as I didn't have a lemon. (not sure how much juice half a lemon renders)
6444	819	I added tomatoes, small piece of garlic chopped up, a little jalapeño pepper, and dried cilantro since I didn’t have fresh everything else I kept the way it was and it is delicious
6445	819	Amazing!
6446	819	Not bad but I will add half the onion next time and will try using a white onion instead of yellow.
6447	819	Light &tasty!
6448	819	Very quick and easy to prepare. Perfect for last minute condiment. More simple guac than I am used to but still very tasty and worked well with my tacos and fajitas. Will most assuredly use again.
6449	820	This was delicious.  Cut recipe in half and made 1 loaf.  To cut 3 eggs in half, I scrambled 2 eggs and used 3/4 of them.  I used 1 avocado.
6450	820	Good recipe added layer of batter then laid in some dark chocolate.Great with orange marmalade on it!May add banana to the mix next go around and tomorrow will do muffins. We were given 6 bags of avocados!
6451	820	What  delicious bread! I made it mostly according to the original recipe - the only changes I made were to bake it in a Bundt pan instead of two loaves,  and I didn't have any buttermilk so I did like a couple of previous commenters and used 1/2 cup of sour cream and a 1/4 cup of milk instead. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  It was very moist and tasty and I will definitely make it again. Oh, and my bread was not at all green, but I was quite content with that.
6452	820	This was awesome and delicious!  Made during COVID-19 while trying to use up too many avocados that I bought.  Didn't have quite enough avocado, so used mashed bananas to make up for them.  Used half regular flour and half whole wheat.  Made one loaf and six large muffins.  Loaf took a full hour and I think would have burned had I not covered with aluminum foil after 40 minutes.  Liked muffins a little more because they didn't cook as long.  Shared with neighborhood kids, my daughter's friends, and they loved it!  Will definitely make again.
6453	820	This bread was easy, quick, cheesy, and delicious.  I added only 1/4 tsp cayenne instead of 1/2 tsp.  Everything else was the same.  Will definitely make again
6454	820	WOW, so moist and dense!
6455	820	Great!  Very moist.  Fooled everyone; thought it was banana bread!
6456	820	Great!  Everyone loved it!  I didn’t make any changes to the recipe.
6457	820	After my alterations I loved this recipe. But before my adjustments it was appalling. The sugar content was so high that it was more dessert than anything else. It was rather nauseating to eat and I had to throw it out. The next time, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/3 cups and it was still super sweet, so I then added a grated carrot and some ginger. My husband is the pickiest eater I know and completely loathes avocado. I think I’ll try to tweak this recipe again to see if I can turn it into a healthy bread. But as it was, after my changes my husband couldn’t stop raving about the bread and has said it’s his favorite bread I’ve ever made. Overall, I’d say this recipe was a fantastic starting point, but that the recipe itself fell short.
6458	821	This was a good easy recipe. I used canned chicken, and it was still pretty good. It did make it more like a dip though. I added pickled jalapenos after baking only because my family likes them. Thanks for the recipe.
6459	821	I was really surprised how good this was. Warm avocado doesn't sound tasty at all but it came out creamy and very flavorful. I will be making this again and again. I made a casserole out of mine, used rotisserie chicken but didn't stuff the avocado skins. Other than that I followed the recipe just as it is. Leftovers the next day were still bright green and even better tasting.
6460	821	Fantastic.. you can also stuff with other things.. crab meat.. lobster meat.. if you like spicy a little cayenne pepper
6461	821	Just loved this recipe! I did add an jalapeno, cilantro, cumin and Cotija cheese. I had a nice amount left over so I stuffed it into mini peppers and baked them a little longer than the Avocados. Next time I'll remove more of the avocado pulp. I will make these again, so good!!!
6462	821	Used crab. Very good!
6463	821	I very much enjoyed this recipe paired with a nice quiche.  I wouldn't change anything with this recipe.
6464	821	I've made this recipe 3-4 times and we simply love it! One key that I've found is to make sure that you scoop out enough of the avocado flesh so that the flavors balance correctly - leaving too much in the shell causes it to lean more heavily towards "avocado". (Unless that's your thing, then go for it!)
6465	821	Very Yummy and quickly made after work.
6466	821	This was delicious! Even with low fat cream cheese, very yummy.
6467	822	Mmmmmmm. Like toastadas, but with melted cheese
6468	822	It didn't taste good
6469	822	I think, first and foremost, that people who alter the original without trying it first as presented are just wrong.  That being said, it's a wonderful recipe with a ton of variables that could be adapted to tailor it to you or your families needs.  But jeez people...rate the recipe...not your version.
6470	822	I used 2 lbs of ground beef.  Used 10 small tortillas. If use flour tortillas would need 2 cans of beans. Used more cheese
6471	822	I made this exactly as the directions instructed.  The recipe is a hit!  I will definitely make it again.
6472	822	Quick and easy very tasty
6473	822	These are delicious! I see that I should have doubled the recipe, though, for my family of 5. These were gobbled up before they even had time to cool.
6474	822	It was so tasty and easy to make.  It is a new family favorite.
6475	822	Tasty  but I don't like the hard tortillas; makes it very difficult to cut, bite or chew through. Not worth the trouble of cooking the tortillas.  Soft wraps are much easier to prepare, serve and eat.
6476	823	Really enjoyed this recipe! I've been looking for some more traditional mexican style carne asada tacos and this was it. Brings back great memories of serving in Mexico. Used some salsa from the store, but still came out really nicely. I would reccomend.
6477	823	It was delish! My family added shredded cheddar to our’s but with or without they were perfect!
6478	823	Family loved it and I was told 'this one is a keeper'. I was pleasantly surprised that my finicky daughter eight more tacos than us! She loved them.
6479	823	This was easy to make and was good. I used KC strip steak which made it very tender. I cut back on the peppers, but it could have used more. We prefer flour tortillas so we used those. I didn't understand why you would double the tortillas up so I didn't. I marinated for a couple of hours. I will make this again.
6480	823	Loved it! These are now my favorite tacos.
6481	823	I had to do a lot of substitution as it's the end of the month, and money and groceries are low. Good, but not as good as I'm sure they could have been - will try again when I have all the right ingredients!
6482	823	This dish was absolutely delicious!  The tomatillo sauce is one of the best sauces I've ever tasted.  I bought the meat already sliced thin making the dish that much quicker to make.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!
6483	823	Absolutely PERFECT! I LOVED the salsa recipe. Not too spicy, not too mild
6484	823	Made this  with 1/2 tsp of red pepper and 1 large chopped Jalapeno .  It was so good the guests I served it to asked for the recipe.
6485	824	I've add some cream cheese. The best combination :)
6486	824	It was great but one mistake i made was not wrapping it the write way but i learned.I will definitely  make it again.
6487	824	Another reviewer said to mix 2 tsp of brown sugar into the vinegar and warm it so the sugar melts before adding to the rice, I did this and was very happy with the result, but next time I would double the sugar.
6488	824	I've been making sushi from this recipe for about 3 years now. I've tried many variations of ingredients. It is an art no doubt. Patience is indeed needed but quickness is a necessity. I also make a teriyaki-honey sauce for dipping. YUM!
6561	832	Just like other reviewers have said, sometimes simple is best. This was easy, fast and delicious. We didn't change a thing and will definitely make it again!
8021	1020	Added a small bit of 1:1 cornstarch/ water mixture to thicken a little for cake decorating.
6489	824	Loved it and substituted just about everything. Had only arborio rice, but prepped and cooked it as per these directions including a 4-5 hour soak and a few drains. I had about 4oz of leftover grilled salmon (not enough to feed our family of 4) so I tried this recipe. Glad I did. I spread the rice as thinly as possible, yet covering most of the nori surface except the top 1/2", then sprinkled some ground ginger over the rice. On half of the rolls, I used about 1T guacamole and some wasabi. On the other half I used wasabi & capers that I squished between my fingers before dotting onto the rice, about 10 capers per sheet. Added the salmon, wet the top of the nori and rolled them up with a bamboo sushi roller. The sharp meat knife I used, sliced through them perfectly! Delicious. THanks for the recipe.
6490	824	Very easy and tasty recipe, great as an appetizer or even as dinner if you make more of them (I find about 6-8 per diner is a good number). One word of caution: spring for good sushi-grade nori, available at most Asian groceries. The cheaper stuff has a slightly sealike taste that, combined with the smoked salmon, makes the finished roll way too fishy.
6491	824	I think once I get the hang of rolling these I'll be able to give it a 5-star rating! I did alright, but there's a lot of room for improvement! My sushi-loving family loved them!
6492	824	awesome recipe for beginners, I personally thought it could use more flavor, but I enjoyed them along with my husband and 2 year old.
6493	824	The amount of rice vinegar was good, but I found the need to add some sugar to cut the acidity of the rice.  Otherwise, it is an excellent recipe.  As a note, you will want a VERY sharp knife to cut the sushi into individual pieces.
6494	825	Wow, we loved this recipe. Made as written except for the bacon, as I didn't have any. So tasty and creamy! Will be making this again and adding it to my recipe collection.
6495	825	I didn't use the peppers and I used bacon in the mix and for the topper.  Delicious!
6496	825	No to the bacon. Not necessary to add more than mayonnaise and a bit of onion. A lot of recipes are like the more ingredients, the better. Not true.
6497	825	I only made from three hard boiled eggs, cut the recipe in half. Very delicious! I plan on making these again.
6498	825	OMG! Love this recipe. I will be renaming it "Millenial Deviled Eggs" because we LOVE avocados. This is the first dish I made for Thanksgiving this year. I was also excited to break out my piping bag and tip for the filling. Some advice: Make sure your piping tip is big enough for the bacon to slide thru. Oops. Anyway, I love the creaminess and they're beautiful too. Thanks!
6499	825	Amazing.  I omitted the hot sauce as I didn't have any on hand and didn't buy any.  Just the right amount of heat.  I also only put jalapenos on half for those that don't enjoy spicy.  This are definitely my go to deviled eggs going forward.
6500	825	I took these to a party and whereas I thought the jalapeno was an exciting new flavor, it turned off most folks.  Those that ate them, took the jalapenos off.
6501	825	Made these for Christmas last year and they were a big hit. I’d never used avocado before so they didn’t come out like I wanted but everyone loved them. Forgot to take pictures ??
6502	825	Maybe I did something wrong but to me these weren’t that great. Seemed a little runny and not super flavorful. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added some additional hot pepper flakes. Even w that it was a little bland. I think there is too much mayo as the recipe is written. I read others skipped the mayo and added more avocado, and I would do that next time if I were to make this again. I’d still use a little mayo but just a little. Also, I served these right away so maybe they firm up more if refrigerated. Regardless, I wasn’t a fan of the flavor or consistency.
6503	826	It was extremely good!  I will add cumin next time but that's about my only change.  Loved it,!
6504	826	My husband and I loved this soup!
6505	826	Made this for my family and they loved it. I wanted more vegetables in it so I added chayote squash and yellow summer squash. For the toppings in addition to the recipe I used fresh Cilantro, dried oregano, fresh onions and Valentina hot sauce. Super good and very healthy soup.
6506	826	Delicious!
6507	826	Very tasty and nice change from regular turkey soup after Christmas.  I used a lot of chili pepper flakes and enjoyed the cilantro and lime flavours.
6508	827	Super easy, super fast, and super good!
6509	827	One of my favourite salads
6510	827	So easy and convinced my arugula hating husband of this leafy greens worth!
6511	827	Went for a March walk in the garden and was surprised to find a patch of arugula growing. The dressing was a perfect compliment for the peppery green. I didn’t have pine nuts so I used some sugared almonds. Added the needed crunch. Hope more people find this excellent recipe. Thanks!
6512	827	Very good. I added a little red onion for flavor. We didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese so I had to use the grated, which made the salad a bit dry. I doubled up on the rice vinegar and olive oil and it was perfect. Would make again!
6513	827	I didn't have parmesian so I used goat cheese which is creamy. I broke it into chunks and when I tossed the salad it made a creamy dressing with some chunks of cheese. I also used grape tomatoes that I roasted the day before. It was so yummy that I made it again the next day. My husband who normally does not like arugula loved this salad!
6514	827	This is a salad that I will add to our meals regularly. So yummy and so easy!
6515	827	Very easy and good. I did not use the capers and I used shaved parmesan cheese.
6516	827	I enjoyed it a lot.. It is nice and refreshing..
6517	828	it was good and it was fun to make
6518	828	Recipe called to cook rice in a pan , which burned all of the rice at the bottom, overall not amazing
6519	828	So So SoSo AMAZING. HAVE TO TRY IT!!!!
6520	828	I have zero experience in cooking and I made sushi following these clear instructions. To my surprise, my kids loved these experimental sushi and asked for more.
6521	828	excellent!
6522	828	This is so good but you have to use the right knife and I use 1/4 cups of mayonnaise with 3 batches
6523	828	The exact taste of a sushi restaurant is there. Very difficult to roll without a bamboo roller, so the form wasn't quite right.
6524	828	Not bad. Won’t use mayo next time. And I’d use 1 thick cucumber strip rather than a few thin.
6525	828	I would have given it a 5 but it was my first time and I'm sure I can do better.
6562	833	I added fresh jalapeno finely chopped and Grape tomatoes cut in quarters.  I omitted the red bell pepper.
6563	833	This salad is SOOOO yummy.  I didn't think I'd like it because of the quinoa but it's so tasty and holds up in the fridge!
6526	829	I love this recipe and have made it several times to rave reviews from family and friends.  The only modification I'd recommend is to let the shrimp sit for several hours in the lime juice or just use cooked shrimp (which doesn't seem to affect the results).  The first time I made it as written, the shrimp was a bit raw. Also, if you like things a little spicy like me, adding minced garlic and chopped jalapeno to taste works well.
6527	829	Loved it! Gone in no time! Cant wait to make it again!!!!
6528	829	Excellent!  Added the Worchestershire sauce, salt and pepper and let it cook overnight. I added a dash of cumin too, just because.
6529	829	Have made this twice. I use wild caught shrimp already cooked and still marinate in lime juice for the stated amount of time or over night. Family like spicy, so I tweak the sauce; 2Tbs Ketchup, 2Tbs Worcestershire, 1Tbs Sriracha, 2Tbs Tapatío & 1Tbs liet soy sauce (yeah, yeah). I also double the Romas and use a whole head of Cilantro. Must use fresh ground pepper and either sea salt or fresh ground pink himalayan. Awesome!
6530	829	My first time eating this and it was delicious!  I didn't know you could cook shrimp in fresh lime juice, so I learned something new too.  My son and daughter in law were here, their Hispanic friends make this all the time and they said this recipe stacks up along side the best.  We ate too much and then had dinner and birthday cake with ice cream.  Perfect family Sunday!
6531	829	Didn’t add the avocado on this picture. I still had it marinating but so far it taste delicious. Added jalapeños for a little kick. Tomorrow for lunch I will add some of the crab meat that I have.  I appreciate the recipe!
6532	829	The taste is great, but the shrimp was in the lime juice too long and "overcooked". Maybe 30 mins would have been better. My only change was using green onions instead of regular ones because I was out and adding orange peppers.
6533	829	Easy to make!! I’ve made this several times and each time it’s a crowd pleaser. I highly recommend
6534	829	Easy and very flavorful ceviche. I rough chopped already cooked shrimp and Persian cucumbers.  I also added mango for an interesting sweet note and Yuzu Hot Sauce for a little more kick and citrus notes.   I would usually use a cocktail sauce for more kick but I made the sauce with ketchup per the recipe and I found I liked the bit of sweetness it added as it married well  with the mango .  It was a big hit at my event.
6535	830	Easy to make.  Delicious breakfast with juice/fruit & coffee.
6536	830	So simple, quick and fresh,  my new go-to recipe!
6537	830	I used one fresh garlic clove rather than use powdered, did not use onion salt, used french bread as no multigrain on hand.  Good.
6538	830	This avocado toast recipe was very quick and easy to make. The only change I made was instead of using black pepper. I used red pepper for a little more kick. It was absolutely delicious definitely will make it again.
6539	830	DEATH BY LEMON!!  I added the juice of half of lemon as instructed and it was not edible.  The next time I made this I used only a teaspoon of lemon juice and was excellent!
6540	830	Delicious on protein bread/toast!
6541	830	easy, delish!  next time a little less lemonthank you
6542	830	I made with out the parsley add 1/2 dised Italian tomatoes spooned out seeds, and 1/4 tsp salt. This recipe is so good all my guest loved it I had as a dip at a party and it was gone right away.
6543	830	Good flavor but reduced seasonings due to small size of avocados. Fantastic with an egg on top!
6544	831	Worked out well enough, but you might have to increase cooking time to get a nice crispy outside. There's lots of flexibility with this recipe, too. You can change the filling, but use this recipe as a guide to make sure you aren't under- or overfilling your quesadillas. This is a good starting point for someone who hasn't made them before.
6545	831	Making quesadillas in a frying pan is my preferred way to make. I spray the pan with just a little cooking spray. If using larger flour tortillas, fold them in half and place two in the pan, and they are easier to flip. I usually use Mexican blend cheese, but I love using half mozzarella and half cheddar. The submitter's idea of putting in a dash of hot sauce inside the tortilla is great. I prefer to put olives, salsa and avocado on the side.
6546	831	used mexican mix cheese
6547	831	Made  a few just mozz, few mixed mozz & mexican blend, few mozz, mex & swiss. Mine had some olives, hubbys didnt. The just mozz ones i made with tuscan seasoning and roasted peppers to go with pasta. No matter how you make them...delicious!
6548	831	just had this for lunch. If you run out of the mottzarello cheese your can use a different kind. Also good idea to have everything ready to go as it cooks up quickly. Will diffently will try again
6549	831	Mmmm loved the avocado in the quesadilla. Made to go as a side to taco soup/chili.
6550	831	I've made this with flour wheat tortillas and with the corn tortillas - they both were great! The wheat tortillas were a little larger which made it easier to fill and handle in the hot pan. I used pepper jack and cheddar cheese. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe Cody.
6551	831	I added some hummus on the tortilla- delicious!
6552	831	My family has made a slight variation of this recipe for years. The main variation we do is that we add a very shallow coating of vegatable oil to the pan before placing the tortilla in it, and fry the tortilla until it is slightly crisp on both sides. It makes for a crunchier quesadilla, and when cut into slices, it makes a great appetizer or movie/game snack. Good basic recipe, thanks!
6553	832	This is easy, healthy, and quickly made.  I served it with Chipotle fire roasted salsa, just the right touch.
6554	832	This was so good and so easy to make. I will definitely be making this again. I am stuffed.
6555	832	Made this for my wife and I for a quick lunch.  We used the balsamic as a substitute for lemon juice recommendation and we thought it was quite good.
6556	832	this was a perfect after run breakfast and filled me up.
6557	832	really good
6558	832	I did have to substitute lime juice for the lemon juice because I forgot to get lemon juice at thr store yesterday and it's too early to get there right now. But, the lime juice didn't make an awful tasting substitution. This toast is a great way to get all my morning nutrients in.
6559	832	This was so good! It really hit the spot this morning!
6560	832	Made this for my husband who needs to avoid salt right now. It was good but salt definitely kicks it up a notch. For him, I omitted salt and added a bit of onion powder and minced garlic (the kind that is jarred in water) for a fully sodium-free version. (Minus what was in the bread, of course) He loved it. Thank you so much!
6564	833	Absolutely loved it!
6565	833	This is a great recipe! I removed the bell peppers and used low-fat Balsamic Vignagrette salad dressing. Yummy!
6566	833	I love this salad and so does everyone else who has tasted it.  We were going to have friends over and they wanted to delay due to the need to eat healthy. I said I have some delicious healthy recipes. Usually I serve this with salmon steaks but tonight I served it with baked yams.For four of us I doubled the recipe and had a little left over.I also really enjoy a balsamic glaze drizzled over this!  It's delicious on its own but the balsamic glaze kicks it up a notch!  In the attached photo, I had not yet added the feta cheese. . . That's important!  ;-)
6567	833	Yum! I use some homemade fermented or pickled red onions in place of fresh cut and throw in diced chicken, ham or egg for some added protein.
6568	833	I keep going back to this one, it's so good!!
6569	833	Stephanie you went over and beyond delicious.  I’m always trying to find healthy recipes (without sacrificing taste) for my fitness group I teach.  This was a hit.  Thank you, next time I have to double the recipe.  I usually make healthy dishes once a month as a little treat after class and serve them in the teeny, tiny tasting bowls, but this time, they looked at me like I was crazy...so it was requested for our next treat as a full lunch.  Isn’t that some nerve??.
6570	833	I had this as late lunch, since am trying to loose weight and my daughter loved it. I omitted the cheese and was still delicious
6571	834	Excellent  choice !
6572	834	This is an awesome sandwich, great for lunch, or a lazy evening when cooking isn't an option. One of my favorite healthy choices.
6573	834	Delicious. I made a few changes but all delicious. My boyfriend and I loved it!
6574	834	These sandwiches are really good.  Depends a lot on the quality of the guacamole.
6575	834	It was ok  I've had better sandwiches I tweeted the recipe a little bit. I used Mexican four cheeses iceberg lettuce mayo organic mustard and tomatoes I didn't  have all the ingredients and i used white bread.
6576	834	Best sandwich ever
6577	834	I thought this tasted pretty good. I had all the ingredients but the sprouts. Instead of guacamole I just used sliced avacado. I also used a different low fat cheese and lite mayo. I thought the mustard amount was excessive and cut that in half. It made for a filling sandwich for lunch today.
6578	834	This was a pretty good sandwich, a lot different than usually make. I didnt have bean sprouts, but sure wish I did.
6579	834	This definitely is an "Awesome Turkey Sandwich"! I used whole grain bread and Hellman's light mayo. I left out the bean sprouts and opted for some smoked bacon instead. I used Swiss cheese vs. Monterey Jack and OMG - this was really good! Perfect for lunch with a dill pickle on the side...
6580	835	Game changing!
6581	835	Good on the grill. The avocados I had didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time I will try the Hass  Avocados. I favored them with Old Bay Spice & Garlic salt.
6582	835	These were ok. I made them exactly as written.  A bit bland but a great idea on how to grill avocados! Next time I may add a pinch of salt and some fresh lime juice.
6583	835	Not a fan of spicy, I used a Chipotle Lime seasoning made by Wildtree. It was great! Thanks for the simple and delicious idea!
6584	835	We found these fairly bland, but I like the basis.   When I try again, I will slice, and season the slices individually to get a bit more flavor.   I think Cajun would be good on this.
6585	835	Very good! All it needed was a sprinkling of sea salt at the end...tasty! I would make these again. Thanks for sharing. :)
6586	836	Love this recipe.  I make it regularly and often tweak it depending on what I have on hand.  I've also used the recipe with some added ingredients as a "build your own" taco salad bar when I have a few guests at lunch.  I always put out sour cream, black olives and diced green chilies for those who like a little "fire".  Always a success.  For just my small family, I use the recipe as printed but cut it in half.  Great summer meal.
6587	836	This is a great recipe.   Easy and tasty.   The Catalina Salad dressing is great--and so easy to add! A keeper I've done for many years.
6588	836	Everyone loved this!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, omitted the kidney beans, used regular Doritos and Ranch dressing instead of Catalina.
6589	836	My family loved this salad!!  It will be a go to for a refreshing, quick dinner.  I did not put onions in mine (not a fan), no kidney beans with avocado on the side.  Other than that I made it to recipe.
6590	836	Turned out great! Added cooked corn, used black beans instead of pinto beans and used Cathy’s suggestion for modifying the dressing (mixed together Catalina dressing, sour cream, a bit of taco seasoning and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix). Will definitely make this again!
6591	836	Very good! Didn’t use chips and opted for a tortilla bowl and instead of the Catalina dressing, I mixed some taco sauce with ranch dressing and it was
6592	836	It was great with home made Catalina salad dressing
6593	836	Very good and easy salad to prepare. Enjoyed by everyone at luncheon. Will use iceberg next time--I didn't have anything but romaine and thought it would work. Lesson learned.
6594	836	mmmmm
6595	837	OK...  I made this for the first time tonight, and followed the recipe exactly.  Some comments follow:1.  It is a good tasting soup, but not great.  Strong tomato taste.2.  Canned chopped peppers...?  There is no such thing in my local store.  There are 50 varieties of whole, sliced and diced peppers.  I used diced.3.  When I opened the Pepper and Onion Stir Fry Mix, I realized it is just red, green and yellow bell peppers with onion.  This soup would undoubtedly be better with fresh ingredients.  The frozen ingredients turn out too soft.4.  The Avocado is essential and adds significantly to the taste.  Do not skip this.5.  There are no tortilla strips suitable for this soup at my grocery.  I used plain and blue-corn triangle chips as a substitute.  Not great.6.  The cheese is optional - skip it.I may make this soup again, but I would use fresh ingredients and probably add some fresh celery, cut back on the ground cumin, and may skip the tortilla chips.
6596	837	Delicious vegan soup or good with chicken broth. We add 1/2 c rice and 2-4 c black beans.
6597	837	I have always questioned whether 3 Tablespoons of cumin is correct.  A NYT recipe calls for only 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder.  I have wondered if the correct amount of cumin is 3 teaspoons rather than Tablespoons.  I always use fresh red, yellow and orange peppers, onion, garlic and often fresh jalapeño and add frozen corn, as well.  I plan on experimenting with different spices like coriander in the future.
6598	837	Delicious! I used 2 cans of green chilies instead of 3 and added a can of beans. If you want to add protein, chicken makes it even better!
6599	837	So good!!!!
6600	837	I thought it was great! My husband and son didn't care for it because there were no dead animals in it. I only had 1 can of green chiles so I threw in 3 fresh jalapeno peppers. That probably made it more spicy, but I thought it was perfect
6601	837	Very filling! And very tasty! I added black beans and topped it off with lime tortilla chips, avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and shredded cheddar... then squeezed a little lime juice on top. So very good! My youngest son refilled his bowl twice!
6602	837	I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. Incredible depth of flavor!  And super easy to make. I made it a day ahead to let the flavors develop and meld. Crowd favorite!
6603	837	This has been a favorite of ours since like 2006 or so. We make it a little differently, but the "base" is the same. I add a can of black beans and use an immersion blender to mix everything together. Then we add corn at the very end if we have it on hand. I probably use a little less broth too. But this has been on our regular rotation for probably 13 years now. So good!
6604	838	We made these and LOVED THEM!  so easy and oh so good...I made them exactly like the recipe said the first time, second time I seasoned the cheese with cayenne powder so it gave it a little kick. My entire family loves these.
6605	838	Sounded good but....  the cheese tacos would not hold a "taco" shape.  They just flattened out and they are very greasy.  You really don't want to handle them without several napkins at hand.  Wasted a whole bar of cheese on these.  Would not recommend - at all.
6606	838	I fixed these today for myself for lunch they were really good. I have some leftovers to eat yet.
6607	838	The recipe is really about the Shell technique. Make your own meat.  Great concept and very good. The shells make it a little greasy. Hard to do several at a time. You would need a wooden dowel.  The wooden spoon still wanted to roll on top of the glasses. Very filling though. I still lost a half a pound and stayed in ketosis. I will make again.
6608	838	Second time we made it.  Cooked the cheddar at 400 degrees for 6 minutes and made "bowls" out of the shells this time.
6609	838	What a stupid recipe.
6610	838	Used 4-cheese Mexican instead of straight Cheddar and tacos wouldn’t stay folded... tastes great though!
6611	838	I have made this several times and its great, I wish the cheese was crispier but it will do for now.
6612	838	Very good!! I didn’t have any taco seasoning, so I add my own.
6613	839	Family LOVED these!
6614	839	did not have a press, just fried it in 2 T of olive oil at medium heat for 5 min each or util toasted
6615	839	This was my first time ever preparing/eating avocado. I'm trying to eat healthier and this was a good first stepping stone towards that. I put lots of red onion on it, super yummy.
6616	839	Added a slice of ham, used sundried tomatoes instead of red pepper.  Served with vegetable soup.
6617	839	I substituted pepper jack cheese and romaine lettuce. I also added dill pickle. This sandwich was amazing! Will make again.
6618	839	Good, but you don't need all the mayo it calls for. We'll cut in half or just a smidgen if needed. With all the mayo in the avocado it was to runny & messy. You couldn't taste the flavor of anything because of the messy mayo/avocado spread. Want to taste the mesquite smoked turkey & avocado especially.
6619	839	This sandwich is so delicious and so versatile! You can use chicken as an alternative, or even make it into a grilled wrap if you don’t have ciabatta.
6620	839	Very simple and delicious sandwich.  I doubled the amount of avocado per personal taste, but otherwise followed the recipe!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!
6621	839	it was good. nothing spectacular though.
6622	840	Made this to compliment my taco lasagna dinner and it was a huge hit!!I have made this over a dozen times now and always have to give the recipe out!!
6623	840	This stuff is addictive!  I've made this many times, taken it to many parties...always gets gobbled up and several requests for the recipe.
6624	840	I’ve made this a couple of times now and on each occasion, it’s been given thumbs up by everyone! The first time, I made it as the recipe states. The second time, I added drained black beans to change it up. Today, for lunch, I tossed the leftovers with leftover bbq’d chicken breasts that I diced and topped it with grated cheese. Holy cannoli! It was delicious!
6625	840	thanks for sharing a delicious and amazing recipe I will try at my home, I really enjoyed your food recipe, waiting for the next chicken recipe.
6626	840	I made this exactly as written,it is perfect,no changes needed.
6627	840	I made this exactly as written,it is perfect,no changes needed.
6628	840	Not impressed.
6629	840	Delicious !!
6630	840	It's SO fresh and delicious. My daughter made it for an appetizer and we inhaled it. A keeper for sure!
6631	841	Loved it!
6632	841	I served it last night for guests and they never commented on it, but I liked it!  One of our guests eats only keto, so I used sugar free jam and lower sugar cranberries so she could eat it.  I thought both the avacado and tomato were a bit out of place in it, so I might leave those out next time. I don't think they added much to the overall flavor.
6633	841	So delicious! All the flavors combined so well! I used olive oil and added some arugula with the spinach. My husband keeps requesting me to make this dressing.
6634	841	My favorite salad! My whole family loves it! I used homemade Raspberry jam from the Farmers’ Market. Delicious!
6635	841	What a pleasing medley of flavors! The dressing was wonderful as was the salad. Easy to make. Pleasing. I will be making this again!
6636	841	Delish! The only modification I made was to use Apple Cider Jelly (TJ’s) instead of raspberry. Everyone loved i!!!
6637	841	Just made it and my family is obsessed! I grilled chicken breasts to throw on and had to use olive oil for the dressing but otherwise followed the directions. So so so good!
6638	841	Very good salad.  I love the blue cheese with the raspberry/red vinegar dressing.
6639	841	My son made it with dinner last night. He forgot the dressing! Still tasted good. My daughter had three servings and finished the salad.
6640	842	Really good - especially the recommended dressing in another comment (Mayo, sour cream, celery seed, etc). Very versatile!! Check your shrimp when thawing in the fridge - my salad was on the salty side and my husband asked if I had rinsed the shrimp since it can be frozen in a saline solution...I hadn’t. Original bag is gone to check.
6704	849	Don’t add 1/2 cup soy sauce. Add 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/3 cup ponzu. 1/2 cup of soy sauce makes it a salt bowl. We wanna taste the fish.
6641	842	Recipe was pretty good. Changes I made were omitting avocado, using 2 packets of TrueLime instead of the fruit, adding fresh spinach to the shrimp mixture as it was cooking, and adding the salad mixture to the skillet for the last few minutes. The lime and butter made a nice dressing.
6642	842	This was such an easy recipe, but sooo good. My husband normally like this kind of thing, but loved it.
6643	842	Great for Christmas Eve dinner.  Made a French dressing... only the 3 yr old did not like the shrimp
6644	842	Great salad...very easy to make. Presentation very attractive and you can easily modify to meet personal taste preference...I.e. More avacado...more celery, etc.  easy enough for mid week dinner. Attractive enough for company!!!
6645	842	i added tomatoes and chives with the mixed lettuce of my choice and it turned out amazing after adding lemon juice and a substitute for  lemons, for I didnt have any and also had pre cooked shrimp which worked with just lemon and baby shrimp.
6646	842	I made this for dinner last night and it was a winner! We've recently decided to get away from having meats on every evening and wanted to begin to include more veggies in our diet by eating more salads.  We wanted to try something different and I ran across this recipe which looked very simple and we happened to have almost all of the ingredients in our house, with the exception of celery and cucumber.  I prepared it on jumbo shrimp using my "trinity": Lawry's Seasoned Salt, Black Pepper and Garlic Powder. Then I added the lemon to it before  sauteing and it was delicious and all of us ate every bit of it in one sitting with our own personal favorite dressings: Caesar Lite & Italian!!!!!
6647	842	Great idea for an appetizer. I added old bay seasoning to the shrimp and used Vildia onion dressing. :)
6648	842	This was good but needed a little more jazz for us.
6649	843	This soup is amazingly good.  Making it for the second time in 2 weeks
6650	843	I have made this recipe several times since finding it, it’s a great base recipe that I have added the following to make it terrific for us. I cook my chicken in the pressure cooker seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder & Tajin for extra lime flavor. To the broth I add cumin, & chili powder, & riced cauliflower. I brown my onions in bacon fat prior to adding my garlic. I also dump in the drippings from my cooked chicken it adds loads of flavor. Top with fresh cilantro, and sour cream. We substitute Serrano for jalapeños because we prefer it spicy, added some kale for my bowl, I wanted some greens! Great soup for cold weather.
6651	843	This is one of my 'go to' soups. Make it all year round. Can be a bit too spicy, depends on the jalapenos you use!A must try.
6652	843	This was a huge hit, especially considering we aren’t huge soup people. Substituted a can of green diced chiles for the jalapeños. Used a can of diced tomatoes because I didn’t have a fresh one. Used butter instead of olive oil. Had zero leftovers.
6653	843	This is a wonderful recipe.  I only had 2 jalapenos and 6 garlic cloves.   I used rotisserie chicken.   My husband loved it.  Quick and tasty and healthy!!
6654	843	I thought this was a good solid meal though not a 5 star for me.  I did use 4 jalapenos and it was not too spicy at all.
6655	843	We loved this recipe!  We seeded the jalapenos and doubled the amount of chicken as we know our tolerance for heat and our preference for hearty soups.  We also ate this with quesadillas instead of the tortilla strips.
6656	843	The first time I made this, I was not very impressed. No spices- cumin, chili powder, oregano, coriander; and simmering a soup for only 10 minutes does not really allow all the ingredients to get to know each other. I have made this twice since and have changed a lot. I only make it when I have the time. I slow cook the chicken using the "Slow Cooker Carnitas" recipe on this site and use the juices from that to start the soup, adding more stock if needed.
6657	843	The first time I made this as written and it had waaayyy to much lime.  This time I doubled the recipe and only added the juice from half of a small lime.  Instead of doubling the tomato, I added a can of Ro-tel.  I used rotisserie chicken  because I was feeing lazy and let it simmer for 30 minutes to soak up all the flavors.  We topped it with the tortilla strips and some queso fresco.  Everyone loved it!
6658	844	Phenomenally delicious! The subtle flavor of avocado, along with the lemon juice/zest, and fresh cilantro and chia seeds gave  a wonderful burst of flavor. Although I could not taste the cayenne per se, I think it probably helped the lemon from overpowering the taste
6659	844	Love this  topped with fresh cut serrano chilis and toasted sesame seeds.  Used sourdough toast.
6660	844	very good! Thank you.
6661	844	Easy, fast,  & So good !
6662	844	Delicious! I loved the addition of the Chia seeds. I made two slices: on the second I added garlic salt instead of regular, and I liked that even more. The only difference I made to the first was to use a regular lemon. Sooo good!
6663	844	Hi quadrupled the recipe sprinkled sprinkled a little Chia seeds on top. Are used real lemon and lemon juice. Love it!
6664	844	Really easy. I put one whole avocado instead of the half for two toasts.
6665	844	While I love avocados and I loved this toast, half an avocado could not possibly have only 1g of fat. In my recipe importer at myfitnesspal, it list this recipe as 11g of fat.
6666	844	Delicious!  Didn't have cilantro and it was still fantastic!!
6667	845	This was great on cod!  Use fresh in-store salsa and not the jarred kind. Salsa contained fresh cilantro that made the fish. We loved this. But would not have like with jarred salsa. A definite make again!
6668	845	Very tasty. left out the cheese, but used everything else.
6669	845	I pulled this recipe on a card out of my recipe box and it was dated June 2004 all recipes.com. I have made this recipe so many times that my printing on the card was pretty much worn away. So went to the website and found it near the top of the page. Great to see it is loved by so many! we will be enjoying again tonight, delicious and easy!
6670	845	I am on a quest to make Cod more palatable so was excited about trying this recipe. I made 4 fillets, 3 as called for in the recipe, and 1 with just the salsa and cheese. They were each good, however, I really liked the one without the tortilla crusting, as the cheese flavoring was able to stand out. I will make this again, but will be skipping the tortilla chips. Thank you for the recipe, Christyj!
6671	845	I really didn’t know what to think due to the ingredient list.  I have this a try and really really enjoyed this.  I did add more salsa, cheese and cook it for 25 minutes to create a crispy cheese top.  I will make this again!
6672	845	This fish was delicious! I used haddock loins for the fish. I didn't have any avocado, so I used the Wholly Guacamole that I had in the fridge. The fish was tender and the guac made the flavours pop even more. Definite keeper.
6673	845	YUM!!  I absolutely love this dish and have been making this for years!  The only thing I leave out is the avocado.  Other than that, it's perfect!  We also make this using chicken and it's equally delish!
6674	845	I eat Keto so I used Pork Panko instead of other breading. I also used soy cheddar shreds and soy sour cream. I don't eat dairy or garbage grain. Everything was organic and wild caught. It was great!
6675	845	This recipe really surprised me.  I tried it because it looked very easy and had good reviews,  but I wasn't expecting much.  It's really very delicious and perfect for a family meal.  Parents and kids loved it!
6676	846	Great recipe - a crowd pleaser at a summer BBQ.  As per comments here, I added some minced onion, garlic, and cilantro. More of an avocado dip than a genuine guacamole.
6677	846	I made no changes! Just great guacamole just like it is written!
6678	846	This is the best homemade guacamole I have ever had. Instead of a dash  or pinch of seasonings, I used 3/4 teaspoon (tsp) onion powder, 3/4 tsp garlic powder, 3/4 tsp cumin, 3/4 tsp cilantro, chopped onions, salt to taste, and lime juice.  I made homemade salsa that is on this website, "The Best Fresh Tomato salsa", but added minced garlic. Put the salsa in the fridge for a few hours so the flavors can meld. Then add salsa to the guacamole. Perfecto!
6679	846	Great recipe.  I took to a gathering last night and everyone thought I’d brought too much.  By the end of the night the bowl was scraped clean and everyone wanted the recipe.  I did kick it up a bit with Sarrono peppers.
6680	846	Truly exceptional guacamole recipe which I have repeatedly made to rave reviews and repeated requests to make again and again!  Thanks ever so for sharing!
6681	846	I wasn't sure what I would think about the cream cheese in this, but I liked it. It's not for when you want traditional guacamole, but it is a good dip. If you make the full amount of dip, it needs more than a dash of most of the seasonings.
6682	846	absolutely a wonderful recipe for a dip when hosting a party.  I substituted fresh french onion dip instead of the sour cream. Delish! Me born and raised from Louisiana , I added drops of Tabasco hot sauce to spice it up a little.
6683	846	Made as written with the addition of the juice of one lime. YUM!  I used all light dairy products too.
6684	846	IT wasn’t alittle bland but still very good
6685	847	Awesomely delicious 💞 I made it with a salad and crunchy chicken breast. I will be making again & again. Thank you
6686	847	I adapted your adapted recipe.  I had sour cream so I used that instead of yogurt.  I used only a tsp of lemon and no hot pepper sauce.  It was yummy.  A dollop on top of my salad went a long way.
6687	847	I loved this recipe!  I made it to dip baked zucchini fries in and it was delicious!  Changes I made: I only had vanilla Greek yogurt - a little extra lemon juice, hot sauce and salt help to disguise the vanilla. I did use less then recommended oil as I wasn't looking for a dressing. Next time I'll add a little cilantro.  Now the big question is how to store what we didn't eat for sandwiches, veggie dip, etc!
6688	847	I added a spoon of  lemon harissa preserved  i had. so good . It’s a creamy thicker sauce can be use as a dip or over shrimp tacos and of course salad! Very good
6689	847	This was creamy and delicious and a great way to use an avocado on the brink!
6690	847	I really like this dressing! I had two old, soft avocados and this was something really nice to do with them. We don’t use a lot of salt so I halved it to one teaspoon. Delicious!
6691	847	Very easy, I actually combined ingredients into a small blender that uses a bottle made for smoothies etc. Did not have enough yogurt so I made up the rest with sour cream. Very good dressing, even my husband loved it and he's not a huge avocado fan.
6692	847	Quick and easy.  I substituted the chili sauce and pepper with Mrs. Dash original flavor to reduce sodium and retain flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Great as spread on sandwiches or on salads with added EVOO.
6693	847	That hit the spot! Made with Greek yogurt. Big bowl of greens, some crumbled chicken bacon, and this dressing, made a wonderful and simple salad!
6694	848	It's good but not great. I got carried away mashing the mixture and ended up with more of a paste, not unlike guacamole instead of an egg salad. I think the key word here was 'gently'.
6695	848	Tastes awesome and I don’t like egg salad
6696	848	Definitely a make again. Will reduce the onion just a tad, and add a bit more of the pickles. Loved this recipe though!
6697	848	I made this but I kinda lost my way at the end.  10 eggs and more sweet ralish. It is good
6698	848	First, I haven’t reviewed an Allrecipes recipe in years!  But the bones of this ovo-cado egg salad recipe are THAT good, I had to.  Second, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because, for me, 2 avocados/6 eggs would have been too much ‘cado and too little ovo.  So, I started with 1 avocado (easier to add than subtract), mashed it, stirred it up with all the other ingredients, and, finally, added 7 cubed eggs.  For the egg/‘cado sizes I was working with, this was absolutely perfecto!  Other than that, I followed directions like a good girl... mostly... and I ended up with the best egg salad I think I’ve ever made.  And basically guilt-free, too (I doubt I used 1/3 c. mayo; I just kinda eyeballed it, scooping in a li’l spoonful).  I didn’t have a red onion either, so I just used 1/2 a li’l sweet onion I had.  I wonder if a red onion would have made it too quacamole-y for me when what I want is egg salad, not guac.  I did add a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and, yeah, YUM!  For the salt/pepper combo, I used a Himalayan salt/garlic mill and some celery salt and Penzey’s California Blend Pepper.  It was so good, BEFORE the flavors even had a chance to marry.  Perfect amount, too: it filled up a 4-cup Pyrex.  This will be my go-to for egg salad from here on.  THANK YOU, AngelaandJakers, for inspiring me to, at long last, put the two best fats on the planet together, one animal and one vegetable, into ovo-cado salad!  Best of both worlds.
6699	848	Made today (10/10/2020).  Cut the recipe in half.  Used Vidalia sweet onions as that's what I had (I prefer sweet onion so usually buy that) and sweet pickle relish as I didn't have sweet pickles.  The avocado I had was overly ripe but I used it.  The taste that stood out was the relish.  I probably won't make this again.   It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't exceptional.
6700	848	Delish, I added NM green Chile's n jalepenos for a NM twist muy bueno
6701	848	Excellent! I added celery and swapped sweet onion for the red. I’ll definitely make it again!
6702	848	Delicious (without the pickles):)
6703	849	Love this recipe, and eat it for lunch quite a bit. I agree that it is a bit on the salty side, as I also use a low-sodium sub and cut the soy sauce back to half. This goes real quick at parties!
6811	861	Very easy and quick and talk about yummy!!!
6705	849	Great recipe! I made a few modifications. Instead of the red pepper flakes, I added siracha. I substituted yellow onion for the green onions since that’s what I had, and added some finely diced orange bell pepper and some fresh ginger. i also substituted lime for the lemon because that’s what I had. I garnished the salad with freshly chopped cilantro. Final result was really salty so I’ll use low sodium soy sauce like someone else suggested. Will
6706	849	Fantastic! The first time I made this I used low-sodium soy sauce (recommended). The second time, I used “sushi grade artisanal hand-made soy sauce $35/6 oz.)”.  Low sodium is better. Easy to find frozen “sushi” ahi steaks in any grocery store for about $7/ pound.  (1 lb. for 8 servings) A double batch disappeared at the party, & everyone wanted this EASY recipe. The party was 2 hours away, & by then the ahi was a  semi-frozen state, perfect for dicing. I had all ingredients pre-measured  & assembled, and cut up the sushi & avocado at the venue for maximum freshness.
6707	849	I've made this now 5 or 6 times, mainly for family celebrations. It gets inhaled. I've had to triple the recipe for a medium sized crowd.  Absolutely AGREE THAT AS WRITTEN ITS WAAAAY TOO SALTY. CUT THE SOY SAUCE IN HALF. ENJOY.
6708	849	So tasty and amazing flavors, this is a fantastic recipe, however, for my preference the ratios is a little off.... I now make it with less cucumber, avocado, and soy sauce and add a little more lemon juice.
6709	849	Amazing but just a lil less soy sauce
6710	849	Really great! We used red onion instead of green and had a ripe mango that made it super special with the avocado
6711	849	This was a great recipe and was used after scoring a full sized albacore tuna.  For its mild tuna flavor, this poke recipe really helped make the fish stand out.  The only part that I changed was putting half the amount of soy sauce.  It wasn't really needed but the other part of the recipe seemed to be balanced.  Will try this one again if I get another full tuna fish.
6712	850	I really liked this recipe it was quick and simple. I added some tomatoes just to make it a little bit more interesting.
6713	850	I always add a small diced tomato also. Spent 44 years in AZ eating all kinds of guacamole and my favorites always have tomato.
6714	850	I doubled the avocados and green onions to four, using same amount of other ingredients and loved it, even my first-time-to-try-guac adult son thought it was great.  A bit peppery but I like pepper.
6715	850	I've never made guacamole before but I mixed up a double batch, following the directions exactly (except that I left out the cilantro because my family doesn't care for the flavor). Everybody loved it!
6716	850	I didn't have everything, so I improvised (onion powder and no cilantro). Everyone loved it including people that claim to hate guac.
6717	850	I have never added pepper to my guacamole.. but boy was it good! Between that and the seasoned salt I was amazed at the different in flavor than my normal go to guacamole. Might add some red onions next time for crunch if I want it to be a touch different.
6718	850	Love this dip i love onion so i half it up with red onion n green onion , no seasoning salt instead i use cumin and add both lime and ?? juice garlic minced and powder cilantro dried and about a little sourcream .... Perfect
6719	850	This is our family favorite guacamole recipe because the ingredients are in such good proportion that it always tastes delicious.  On occasion, I sometimes substitute finely chopped sweet onion if I don’t have the green onions.
6720	850	Way too salty! I put in less than half a teaspoon of Lawrey's seasoned salt and it was almost too salty. Served with tortilla chips so even more salt there. Caution needed!
6721	851	Made this but simplified by using tortilla chips instead of frying tortillas. Was a hit with all four kids and husband!
6722	851	Delicious!!!!!! I made this as a family dinner and it went down so well. This is also similar to a turkish kebab without the mexican beans. I was suprised with the cheese underneath but work so well as melts onto tortillas yuuummmmmm.
6723	851	Just as with Cajun-style shrimp boils, family & friends gathered around the table helping themselves to a huge, scrumptious botana platter can evoke fond memories which long outlast the meals!  Excellent recipe, excellent outcome!  Added a beautiful Mexican flan for dessert.
6724	851	wonderful recipe! I grew up in the Rio Grand Valley and have missed eating these! Thank you for posting this.
6725	851	Excellent! The cilantro made a lot of difference in the flavor of the meat mixture. The peppers and onions were surprisingly good, but I sprinkled with extra FRESH peppers and onions like our local restaurant was extra YUM!! I also used homemade refried beans and restaurant-purchased fresh chips.
6726	851	No, no, no. Many of the reviews mention skipping the very important step of frying the tortillas, in favor of buying bagged chips! Do not do this. My family has been making Botana for many years and many have tried this. It doesn't taste anywhere near as good nor as authentically Mexican, with bagged chips.
6727	851	This was very good.  The only thing I did differently was to add more seasoning and made Luvann's guacamole (from this site).  My family objected to frying the tortillas for health reasons, so everyone made their own fajita burrito.  I really want to try it with the fried tortillas, so I will make it again!
6728	851	I made this last night and it was phenomenal! My boyfriend is from Texas, and we currently live on the Jersey Shore. He works very hard, 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant. Since he works late every night, he usually misses dinner with the family, so every Saturday night I make him a big meal to come home to, and this week he wanted something in the line of fajitas. This recipe looked so good, and it did not fail to WOW him. I made it mostly verbatim, with the exception of the guacamole - I didn't have any lemon pepper on hand so I used regular pepper, and added a splash of lemon juice and lime juice to the guac, and it was SO good, he ate three servings and was so full he couldn't move for awhile, lol. He's bringing some in to work today to show it off to his coworker, who is from Mexico, and I'm pretty interested to see what he thinks since his wife is an amazing cook when it comes to authentic Mexican food. I was very very pleased with this recipe and it is now a regular in my recipe keeper, thanks Rhonda35 for posting!
6729	851	Excellent dish.  Time consuming but worth it!  The leftovers and just as yummy.
6730	852	So darn good
6731	852	Absolutely loved this salad. The jalapeño is a nice touch but it might be a little too spicy for some.
6732	852	We liked this and I will make it again.
6733	852	Great overall, but I'd definitely recommend scaling back the cilantro (I wound up using way less than the recipe called for and added basil because I had a bunch on hand).
6734	852	Great salad. Family loved it.
6812	861	I doubled the sauce so I could pour it over rice. Very tastey
6735	852	Funny that this recipe is rated 5 stars but the only two reviewers haven't even tried it yet! I know I don't like cilantro but this recipe sounds so good that I thought perhaps this time I might, so I gave it a try. I was wrong. The cilantro ruined it for me. However, my friend who does like cilantro thought the salad was great. I don't like to rate a receipe that I didn't make as stated (I left out the red onion and Jalapenos only becasue I didn't have them on hand, and scaled the recipe back to about half) but in this case it seemed appropriate. My friend really liked it and I think I would too if maybe I used a smaller bit of parsley instead of the large amount of cilantro the recipe calls for. The lime juice as a dressing is really nice, but be careful with the salt.
6736	852	Sounds delicious.  I just picked fresh tomatoes and peppers from my garden and your recipe inspired me to do something productive......  Thank you.
6737	852	Sounds delicious, will be making soon.  Thanks for sharing.
6738	853	Taste great. Changed the recipe slightly based on suggestions...1/2 cup brown sugar, coconut milk and a couple dashes of cinnamon. Great use of extra avocado's.
6739	853	It had a really nice flavor but I thought it could have used a lot less sugar.
6740	853	I made it with one tiny avacodo because that's all I have, coconut milk that's really fatty, two 1/2 cups of stevia ,  two little things of vanilla extract and it WAS delicious!
6741	853	In Brazil we make avocado with lime juice, a little bit milk, and sugar.
6742	853	This was very tasty . I was a little skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. Will make again
6743	853	My 1st time trying Avacodo,couldn't do it wrong!!absolutely delicio
6744	853	Love it
6745	853	Made this just the way it was written. Read some reviews first and chose a larger avocado based on that reading.Because I don't own a large food processor I mashed the avocado first with a fork then put it in my mini food processor to finish creaming it. Then I scraped it into my blender and added the sugar and milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Whipped it up for about 30 seconds or so. Set in fridge and served it over top of vanilla bean ice cream. It was so delicious. Will for sure make this often especially when I have an avocado sitting around to use up.
6746	853	This was so good.  I didn't have vanilla so I used almond flavour.  I think my little one will now eat avocado.
6747	854	We loved it at our house. I just doctored the beans a bit. I cooked them without draining and rinsing and drained before plating. Great recipe for supper.
6748	854	Replaced the egg with Scrambled Tofu from this site which is an  excellent recipe, try it out!  My only real critique of this recipe is that adding the black beans is adding carbs.
6749	854	I liked it, not to heavy yet it filled me up. I had to make my own salsa and I botched that by adding a can of crushed tomatoes. So prep was a few minutes longer and i have a huge bowl of spaghetti flavored salsa now too!
6750	854	This is really yummy! Although, I might have made too much for one person.
6751	854	Honestly not very good. No flavor in the beans, and there are better recipes. I would rather have breakfast quesadillas.
6752	854	Great breakfast.  Will definitely be making this again
6753	854	So simple, so filling, so delicious. We loved it!
6754	854	only three points on weight watchers. This came out good. very versatile. it did fill me up for quite a bit of time before another meal. I would recommend using Goya beans because they don't fall apart and they taste the best. And I would also recommend using a firm avocado instead of a mushy one or one that's starting to turn brown. very weight watchers friendly. I used fresh cut salsa instead of canned or jarred to cut down on sodium and to enhance the fresh flavors. .
6755	854	Genius idea! Very filling! Definite lifetime keeper recipe. Thanks Matt D. for sharing your recipe.
6756	855	I made this recipe and it was absolutely perfect and delicious.I used the remainder the next day to my two ingredients (salsa, chicken breast) 10 min pressure cooker shredded chicken at the keep warm stage and it made the most perfect and moist shredded chicken for tacos night one and enchiladas night two.
6757	855	This was unusual yet very tasty. I added a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper. Then just prior to serving, I added 2 tablespoons of finely shredded cheddar cheese into the sauce, then poured on top of broccoli.  Very good, easy & quick!
6758	855	I have to admit, I'm not a fan of avocado.  I made this to cut the heat from the barbacoa I made and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of this sauce.  It was excellent!  I made it as written.
6759	855	Excellent! I made this as written and it was delicious. I served it over fish tacos but it would be good on many different things.
6760	856	Very good, lasted a few days before turning brown, and did add it to my favorite.
6761	856	I really enjoyed this recipe. To kick it up a level, I added roasted poblano peppers instead of jalapenos, and a touch of sour cream. The sour cream is a great way to balance the spice; you get a kick of spice, but it fades away without burning your mouth. I served this with chips, breakfast tacos, enchiladas, roasted potatoes, as a salad dressing, and so on. It even freezes well, so you can make extra for later.
6762	856	There's this amazing salsa verde type guacamole we get from a local meat market and I have been searching for a year for a similar recipe.  I feel like I've finally found a recipe just like it.  This is so good, I feel like boiling the tomatillos really makes a huge difference compared to similar recipes I've tried.  This has great flavor and perfect texture.  I made exactly as written but to please my hubby I added a cut up avocado after it was done as he prefers a chunky style.  This will definitely be in my regular rotation.  My whole family loved this.
6763	856	Roasted instead of boiled.  Added no water at all.  Came out very well after avocados were added.
6764	856	Easy and tasty recipe. I will be making this again.
6765	856	So delicious!! I will definitely make it again! I stuck exactly to the recipe and wouldn’t add lime juice, because it already has a tangy taste to it! Perfect as is
6766	856	First time making the recipe. I like it very much will make more in the future. Thank you for the recipe.
6767	856	This recipe is most improved by roasting the tomatillos and jalapenos in the oven for about 20 mins. at 400 degree, until they're a little toasted. You can easily peel off any burned parts by quickly placing them in a plastic bag to steam the skins a little. This method brings out more flavor than boiling.
6768	856	everyone loved this.  I will add more peppers next time though since it was pretty mild after cooking the peppers.
6769	857	Family totally loved it.
6770	857	This was awesome. We use pork tenderloin on rotation and have tried several recipes. This one was great!
6771	857	Good and easy recipe. I cut the garlic powder down to 1 1/2 cause 2 seemed like a lot and I’m glad I did. We enjoy garlic but something about powder just makes me hesitant vs fresh and fresh will be used next time for sure.
6772	857	It was delicious, this will be my go-to pork tenderloin recipe. I made a few personal adjustments: I melted the butter and brushed it on the pork loin then added salt and pepper. I mixed the rest of the melted butter with honey, apricot preserve, minced garlic and thyme to add later. I cooked it longer to reach 165F, about an hour and 15 minutes altogether. I basted it with the butter/preserve every 15 minutes.
6773	857	Very tasty! I used the olive oil to rub it down. It worked well! My partner really liked it too! Its a keeper recipe!
6774	857	I made this for Christmas and my family loved it! Delicious, fun to make and no leftovers.
6775	857	Easy and tastes great. A good combination of flavors.
6776	857	This was so yummy! Made exactly as written. Heated the leftover baste and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a little and drizzled over the sliced pork.
6777	857	It was good but it’s still pork tenderloin
6778	858	I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added 2 Tbls. Butter to top of apricots before putting on lattice to crust.
6779	858	I made this, and it’s even better than peach pie - more natural color and tart stone-fruit flavor. Used my own homemade crust, but ... obviously! And brushed it with cream and sprinkled turbinado on it before baking ... again, obviously!
6780	858	I purchased store brand pie crust, used about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and my apricots were firm.  I also used 7 cups of apricots to fill deep dish pie crust.  Before placing top crust on I added 2 Tablespoon of butter on top of sliced apricots. Baked 55 minutes
6781	858	Yum, it was great, my family loved it.  I added a little more cinnamon.
6782	858	Used 2 tins of apricots in juice as they're not jn season here. Drained and dried them, used about 1/4c more flour as recipe was quite wet. 1/2C brown and 1/2C white sugar as suggested by others to offset the tartness. Turned out delicious. Thanks
6783	858	My first try made me cry when my Neighbor gave me the bag of fresh Apricots and challenged me to make a pie.   He tasted it and said “ it’s just like my Mom’s pie.   No fuss, no many flavors , just apricots”.    His Wife agreed.
6784	858	Great pie.  I added a little more sugar to the apricots.
6785	858	Great with sour apricots! You can also try muffin tins,  instead of a pie dish. Keep an eye on them in this case, as normal cooking time will vary.
6786	858	This is an average recipe. First, I made my own crust, using 1/2 butter and half butter-flavored Crisco. Plus I add about 1 tsp sugar and 1 1/2T fine chopped walnuts. My signature crust!
6787	859	Excellent.  Would not change anything.  Made it for Christmas and Easter, it is a winner.
6788	859	This recipe was absolutely, hands down,delicious. So did my 31 dinner guests. Thank you so much.
6789	859	Awesome and easy.  Make sure you mix it well before you pour it over the ham.  Otherwise, the apricot will seep thru the tinfoil & stick to your pan.
6790	859	Just used this recipe for the Apricot Glaze which was fantastic.Everyone Loved it 15 people!
6791	859	It turned out very moist and flavorful. The glaze was originally too thick to ‘paint on’ the ham. But, when watered down it became watery at cooking.
6792	859	I used this on my Christmas ham. It was amazing.  I usually use just mustard and brown sugar. The apricot jam took it to a whole other level.
6793	859	So good and easy! My husband loves hunny baked ham he said this ham was better! I did use Dijon mustard instead of the dry. I also made about double the glaze to ensure I had plenty.  30 minutes before ham was done I removed the foil. I also used extra glaze and some of the ham juices to make a lovely sauce. I did have to cook ham my 10 pound ham over 3 hours so give yourself a bit of extra time.
6794	859	Nope, it was perfect
6795	859	I love this recipe. Only 2 things that I did differently was I cooked in a oven bag (for easy clean up) and I cooked in my slow cooker, on low for 2-4 hrs, depending on size of ham. I did add a little (1/4c.? pineapple or apple juice to bottom of bag)
6796	860	This recipe was great. It is more cake than I’m used to with a cobbler but everyone gave wonderful reviews and it’s a very simple recipe.
6797	860	Instead of making the topping as suggested use a white cake mix and use 7 teaspoons of butter non melted and with your hands knees it into cake mix making it crumbly and add to top and bake for same time put on top of apricots and add cinnamon at top and you will love the flavor !  Picture is before baked !
6798	860	This is a great recipe. I thought that I had messed it up when incorporating the dough mixer. But it turned out delicious. The cobbler was light and whent great with the apricots. WOW, thanks for sharing!
6799	860	Easy to make and hubby loved it!!
6800	860	I make this every June since I have an apricot tree. The only modification is I increase the fruit to 10-12 cups and increase sugar and cornstarch or flour. I divide the fruit mixture between 2, 9” pans. The biscuit topping recipe makes A LOT so no need to double that. It covers both pans completely as you can see from my picture of one of the pans. I also sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Serve it with vanilla ice cream-oh so gooood!
6801	860	I think this is a delicious simple recipe!  Now that I know the basics I can add my own touches.
6802	860	This tasted awesome! I added a bit more cinnamon. I also used a fork to measure the flour and leved it off. I didn't use quite a cup of milk and limited the sugar sprinkled on top to half a tablespoon instead of the two tablespoons it asked for. The crust was the best I've made!
6803	860	Yes but I had not made so I use allspice and I use blueberries with the apricot with a Twist and rum smells good. This was a good simple easy recipe to follow and with a crumble I actually add toasted walnuts and and toasted oatmeal
6804	860	Very simple but great in flavor, my family love it.
6805	861	Instead of wine I used orange juice, added garlic and omitted the ginger, baked and served with jasmine rice… soo good. Will definitely make this again!
6806	861	The whole family loved it. Easy to make and I love the sauce. We have to double the recipe to make enough for the family because we add extra chops for leftovers.
6807	861	Simple & easy and delicious!
6808	861	Very tasty and quick to fix. I did substitute the fruity wine with a chardonnay.
6809	861	No changes, I will make it again
6810	861	Made this recipe as us, no changes. It’s a keeper! It was delicious and easy. My husband and I really enjoyed this dish!
6813	861	I used Orange Marmalade because the store did not deliver the Apricot preserves.  The sauce was delicious.
6814	862	Delicious but we also cut the sugar in half.
6815	862	To reduce sugar by half go ahead and substitute flavored liquor in place of lemon juice and omit vanilla. I used peach schnapps. You may add more sugar if fruit was tart but keep it at 4 cups maximum. Then it’s five stars plus.
6816	862	Really good jam!
6817	862	I made this.  I got this huge bag of dried Turkish apricots from Amazon because I got tired of buying my jam fro Walmart.  Was really impressed.  On thing that should be on the recipe is once you start combing the apricots and sugar you have to constantly stir the mixture.  The bottom of mine got burnt twice.  I only had the pot on medium and it says to has to boil.  I will be much more careful on the next batch.
6818	862	I make a lot of fruit jams every year and I LOVE dried apricots and apricot jam so I thought I'd see if there was a recipe for Dried Apricot Jam on the Web.  Sure enough, here it is on All Recipes!!!  This is a delicious jam made exactly as written and I've received rave reviews from everyone I've gifted it to.  I'll be making a large batch in the next couple of days and canning it in a boiling water bath for gifts at Christmas and all year round!  Oh yes, and a few for my husband and me as well!!! ; )  Can't wait for this and some strawberry-rhubarb jam, too!
6819	862	I followed the recipe exactly. It tastes just like dried apricots, so if you like dried apricots, you'll love the jam, too. Like Jessica Paige, I made it solely to use up some unappetizing looking dried apricots. I've used up all he jam now, and I like it so much that I went out and bought dried apricots so I could make another batch!
6820	862	Thank goodness I found this recipe as I don't know what I would have done with the organic, unsulfured dried apricots my husband brought home one day. They sounded wonderful, but they tasted terrible...so I made apricots into jam! I didn't have any pectin, so I grated in an apple and used a bit of tapioca flour to help it congeal. I also used almond extract as I had more of that on hand than vanilla. Finally I  only had enough apricots to make about a cup of jam, so I just popped it in the fridge when I finished making it and we enjoyed it for the next week. All in all, a lifesaver...thank you Cookin4Six! for sharing this recipe!
6821	862	Way too much sugar. I only added 1/2 cup of Stevie. No pectin so added a 1/2 teaspoon of agar. Simmering under low heat for 15 minutes or until the jam thickens up. Good recipe. We used 500 grams of dried apricots and 2 large cans of apricots in heavy syrup. We discarded the syrup. Good recipe. No bwb bath. Just put in Ball pint jars and into the fridge.
6822	862	MMMMMM Love this.  I used 6 Tbls of my homade citrus pectin I canned yesterday and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  This will be great holiday food.
6823	863	I made this for my book club following the recipe except didn’t shred the chicken. This dish was amazing!! Will make again for dinner parties.
6824	863	I halved the onion, and it was still too much onion for my husband.  With only one onion in the dish, I found it onion-y but I liked the overall taste.  My husband found it so onion-y he had trouble finishing his serving.  But it is a great mix of spices and dried fruit!
6825	863	Awesome and delicious. Used fresh grated ginger instead of ground and added a can of chickpeas. Thank you!
6826	863	Only 4 reviews? What the heck?! This was delicious.
6827	863	Really good. I didn’t have quite enough chicken so I added some rinsed canned chickpeas during the last half hour of cooking.  Also served with fresh cilantro garnish.
6828	863	.so much flavour. I used cranberries instead of raisins
6829	863	Great flavor
6830	863	We were in Morocco in November and bought a tangine so I was looking for a recipe to take us back to Morocco.....this was delicious and like a dish we had. I halved the recipe and cooked it in my tangine. Delicious!!
6831	864	It’s a very nice recipe. My son love it
6832	864	I made this apricot chutney to go over some salmon that we made, and it turned out really good. Great recipe, and will definitely make again!
6833	864	I thought it was too thin so I cooked it longer.  It never seemed to thicken, so I hoped as it cooled it would thicken.  Of course then it was VERY thick!  The taste was very good, but I wasn't sure how to use it.  I made it for a book club dinner as we were reading a book about South Africa.  I hope to use it with some pork chops soon.
6834	864	No changes !!!  Great
6835	864	I made the basic apricot preserves recipe also found on Allrecipes, but used 4 instead of 6 cups of sugar and added one pint of blueberries. I then followed this recipe to the letter and it is delicious!
6836	864	I used homemade peach freezer jam instead of apricot, because it's what I had. I doubled the roasted garlic, because yum. And once it was all mixed together I threw it in the crockpot on high for 4 hours over some nice porkchops. Turned out really good. A little on the sweet side but very flavorful.
6837	864	great recipe, but I substituted ready made roasted squeeze garlic. saved a lot of time and still gave it great flavor. Also used fresh ginger, minced in a robot coupe. Much better than dried ginger. this chutney is great with coconut shrimp or bacon wrapped scallops.
6838	864	Perfect chutney !
6839	865	Great flavor easy to make
6840	865	great
6841	865	Loved it.  I was a touch more generous with lemon zest.  And I refrigerated overnight. Made the next day.  So good.  Will be adding to my Christmas baking this year
6842	865	I made these today and they turned out bland and boring. The thumbprint does not hold during baking and I have made a few thumbprint recipes. The cookie itself has zero taste.
6843	865	This is a great recipe. I used homemade cranberry orange sauce in place of jam on half my cookies & they were delightful?! I did not add any powdered sugar?. I think next time I’ll add a dash of salt to bring out the flavors. I couldn’t taste the lemon.? I did not add any powdered sugar, I didn’t it needed it. I use a small ice cream scoop to form the cookies and a wine~cork works perfectly for the intention and gets a nice deep well for the jam.?? I definitely will be making these again.?
6844	865	Delious, soft and buttery cookies perfect to compliment my homemade preserves. I will be making them again for sure.
6845	865	Yup, follow the recipe.  Plowed snow half-way through so refrigerated dough overnight.  Parchment paper makes life a lot easier.
6846	865	I followed this recipe and I am amazed at how simple this was to make. I didn’t change anything.
6847	865	These were absolutely wonderful!  Everyone loved these!  Bravo!
6848	866	I did the recipe but made pork loin instead of beef. Delicious!
6849	866	Really, really good if you like lentils.  I've made it twice rhis week.  Lots of protein per serving.  Be sure an add the spices.  (I even add a little more than called for.)  Make a big batch as it can be served with other side dishes or a meal in itself.
6850	866	I don't measure anything, but if is the best stew I have ever made. I did cook the meat for several hours in the crock pot to save on propane. It turned out beautiful.
6851	866	Pro tip from an amateur: serve with some freshly toasted almond slivers/chutes on top.
6852	866	I've made it twice now.  Delicious mix of flavors! I did have to add water & cook longer to get the lentils tender, otherwise prepared as directed. So good I added it to my  meal rotation.
6853	866	Very tasty!   The flavor was nicely complex.  Adding 10 different spices to a dish gets you to that point.  I was generous with the carrot and celery (doubled the amt).  The final product was a bit thicker than I expected, but not TOO thick. Still, maybe another 8 oz of beef broth would have been just fine.  It was good for dinner, served with some corn muffins.  I'll certainly add this to my 'cook again' list.
6854	866	Delicious!!! A hint of sweetness and such depth of flavor. I served it over roasted broccoli, which soaked up the juices. Highly recommend this. Also very easy to prepare.
6855	867	Good easy pie recipe. I didn’t have orange liqueur, so I substituted 1 tsp of orange extract and added a bit more water to the filling. Topped with whipped cream, it was a hit for dessert.
6856	867	Waaaay too much sugar!!! Thank goodness I realized that before I put all that sugar in.  I used 1/2C sugar and it was ample.  Also, cooked the apricots beforehand for 15 minutes.  Used an eggwash to seal the pastry and brushed with eggwash.  Sprinkled sugar on top.  Covered with foil when it was golden brown.  Excellent!
6857	867	I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup but next time I will only use 1/2 cup. Very sweet but we did enjoy the pie.
6858	867	Way too sweet...
6859	867	I made this for Thanksgiving potluck and everyone loved it (especially me).  It's slightly tart with a deep apricot flavor.  Wonderful.  The only downside was that there were no leftovers.
6860	867	A delicious pie, but a bit too sweet. Next time I'll add less sugar. I put in some grated lemon rind for balance.
6861	867	A good use of a big bag of dried apricots. One piece is very filling!
6862	867	I made this recipe pretty much as is except I cut the sugar in half because I like my pies to be sweet/tart. The apricot flavor of the pie was very intense - unfortunately - the sulfur taste had intensified also. I love apricot pie so I put the pie down the disposal and tried again using unsulfured apricots. I had to adjust the amount of water and simmering time because unsulfured apricots are hard and dry as well as being dark. The filling was charcoal grey, which I could have lived with, but it was also bitterly intense.  I wish I could have made it work but I won't try this recipe again unless another reviewer has a suggestion which might help.
6863	867	I added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and used slab apricots which are already cut.  I only had to bake for 30 minutes, otherwise the crust would have burned.  It also may be a little too sweet.  The last touches I made was some sliced almonds on the top of the pie for decoration.
6864	868	Very good hearty dish. Agree with other suggestions - doubled the spices and added in the chicken broth earlier to deglaze spices. Threw in 1 cup  red potatoes  and 1/2 cup carrots chopped large because I could:) (it's that kind of flexible dish). I added chickpeas before cooking (rather than at end). Used 2 chicken thighs frozen  and set instant pot for 10 minutes and did great. NPR for about 10 minutes.    Shredded the chicken into the dish. Yummy.
6865	868	Family loved it.  Kids enjoyed trying something new.  Great combination of flavors.  I did not use Instant Pot, but did this in the oven -- is there any way you can add oven cooking instructions to some of the Instant Pot recipes.
6866	868	This was very easy and delicious. I used chicken breasts for dietary reasons and it still turned out great - though I suspect thighs would have been even better. I added fresh ginger because I had it. I used crushed tomatoes because it's what I had in the cupboard. And I chopped a large sweet potato and threw it in because, why not? Totally great! Will make it again.
6867	868	Made this recipe almost exactly as written and it's a great start. The only differences I made was to add the tomatoes and chicken broth to the onions and spices to deglaze the pot so I wouldn't get a burn warning and add a handful of golden raisins since I had them. When I make this again, I think I will double the spices and I will use chicken thigh filets since the skin just got slimy being pressure cooked.
6868	868	I followed it with the ingredients and just upped the spices by half.  Delicious.  Thank you Diana
6869	868	Delish!
6870	868	It’s a keeper
6871	869	Liked it.  I tweeked it a bit:for more flavor, I used stock (either chicken or vegetable) instead of wateralso, in a  couple tablespoons of ghee, I warmed some curry spice, then added diced onion and cooked until transparent. I then added dried fruit to cook for a minute or two.  I added this to the already cooked couscous.I substituted pistachios for the almonds and sprinkled chopped parsley before serving
6872	869	Cooked the couscous in a combination of the craisin water used to "cook" the craisins and the remaining part OJ. Used pecans instead of almonds, about a  1/4 tsp of cumin, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and skipped the scallions. Almost a dessert!
6873	869	I used quinoa instead couscous.
6874	869	Toasted the almonds and cooked the couscous in orange San Pellegrino. Fast and delish!
6875	869	Wonderful, I used orange juice instead of water and cooked couscous as per directions on container. Make sure you put the water from your raisins or craisins in with all the other ingredients .  This should be noted on the directions other wise your finished product is too dry.  I used  half the cumin and added cinnamon as others suggested.  I have made this twice since finding the recipe.
6876	869	The cumin was too strong.  I would add a little cinnamon.
6877	869	This was the best side dish I have ever made! The only problem I had was I could not stop eating it!  I did cook the couscous with the orange juice and used a half a tsp. of cumin and a half a tsp. of cinnamon. When the dish was finished I poured a quarter cup of orange juice over it. Yummy!!!!
6878	869	A good start, but the cumin did not work with this recipe. I put only half a teaspoon and it overpowered everything else. I left out the apricots and scallions but added two shredded carrots.
6915	873	in a dessicator for 10 hours and you end up with a crunchy fruit crisp - very addictive!
6972	880	I added dates, as well, but what really made the muffin was diced candied ginger - that added the flavor that others said may have been missing because of the lack of spices.
6879	869	Simply delicious! Definitely prepare it using orange juice vs. water for more flavor. Like others, I cut the amount of cumin down to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of curry powder.  Instead of dried apricots I added an 11 oz. can of mandarin oranges. I did find it to be a bit dry so I did add a little more orange juice.  What a quick and easy side dish that tastes like you spent hours! Tastes great room temp. or chilled - Thanks for a great recipe!
6880	870	This is a really tasty dish but the recipe only calls for 1/2 Cup of the spice mix you've created meaning that you're left with allot left over. I used breasts but otherwise followed recipe exactly. The family enjoyed it. There is no spiciness at all so might add a little next time. Also, will try using a whole chicken next time putting the spice under the skin and in the cavity to use it all up. And maybe the insta pot.
6881	870	SO GOOD. I adapted the recipe for the Instant Pot/pressure cooker. I used chicken thigh filets - 6 pieces, because even though I adjusted the spice section to 2 servings rather than 6, I had a ton of spice leftover. I added the oil and seared the chicken in the IP, removed it, and added the onions and garlic. When they were ready, I added the apricot, chicken broth, etc (didn't have mint or cilantro so skipped it) - BUT then I also added a cup of basmati rice, stirred, then added the chicken on top. Cooked for 10 minutes, then let rest for 18 minutes. I probably could have added another half cup of rice, but as-is was AMAZING. And I didn't have to stand over my stove for 2 hours in this summer heat!
6882	870	Very delicious
6883	870	cool
6884	870	Love this dish! I use a whole chicken instead of just thighs and it works really well, and it gives us more meals for weeknight dinners!
6885	870	Flavor was good, but a little too strong. It seems like a lot of seasoning for just 4 pieces of chicken. I would try 6 or even 8  pieces next time. Probably will cute down the honey by 1/3 as well. I don't have sliced almonds so used cashew pieces instead and it was a great combination
6886	870	Excellent!  We had a similar recipe at a restaurant and this is better!  Planning to make it again!
6887	870	Outstanding dis!  I was not told it would be addictive!
6888	870	Absolutely delicious! Family loved it! Made it twice. I didn’t have cilantro. It was the only ingredient missing. Will make it again!
6889	871	Great twist on a favorite that actually made it better. Everyone loved itl.
6890	871	Great!
6891	871	This recipe is a real treat and I loved being able to surprise my family with the unexpected flavors. I’ve made this about five times so far. It’s an absolute hit every single time! If we have any leftovers they get eaten for lunch the next day. It’s great with green beans or roasted Brussels sprouts as a side. Thank you for sharing your mother’s recipe!
6892	871	This is a amazing!!!
6893	871	This recipe is fantastic, it it easy to make and full of flavor. I used 90\\10 ground sirloin and a little more onion. Will definitely make it again!!!
6894	871	A big hit!  Meatloaf was good but not that unusual.
6895	871	Made this as written.  The glaze was extremely sweet, even with the inclusion of the hot sauce, and the recipe made far too much of it. I wound up discarding quite a bit, but it still overwhelmed the meat instead of accenting it.
6896	871	This is the BOMB! I’ve made it twice just as the recipe is written and everyone Loves it! This last time I have a  native Londoner that has lived in the states for 20 years and never ate meatloaf, raving about this recipe. He even wanted to take home a doggy bag so he could make a meatloaf sandwich the next day! Super easy, very quit preparing , and the glaze is nice and thick so it stays when you pour it over the meat.
6897	871	Very tasty! I omitted the hot sauce and used a pinch if cayenne in the glaze due to preferences. Will definitely use the recipe again.
6898	872	Love this recipe and have made it for a number of special dinners.  it is always a hit!
6899	872	I'll definitely make this one again!  Great flavor without fancy, specialty ingredients. I had everything on hand except the dried apricots.  I didn't even miss them!  Everyone in my family liked it - even my 13yo son who would just as soon live on cold cereal.  Great recipe!
6900	872	Wow! So delicious!  Made this according to the recipe (little bit less red pepper since my husband’s not into spicy hot) and it was perfect.  Served it over some brown rice.  It will be part of our dinner rotation
6901	872	Made this for dinner but ommited the dried apricot since I didnt have any on hand.  it came out really tender and flavorful. My picky husband loved it! He even  requested it for dinner the very next day.
6902	872	Great for gourmet lovers
6903	872	I didn't have any apricot juice, so I used orange juice, and the chicken was boneless breasts, and this was still delicious!  I can't wait to try it with apricot juice!  I also cut way back on the curry, since we are a wimpy family as far as spice goes.  Thank you, Katherine!
6904	872	really good i added it some cumin and cayenne pepper .
6905	872	This is wonderful.  It is a little hot, so the next time I make it I'll use less red pepper flakes.  My wife and I love curry so I increased the curry.  I used whole chicken breasts but the next time I will cut them into bite size pieces.  This is a recipe fit for company.
6906	872	Great recipe, it was easy and our friends were extremely impressed. Made it twice and held back a bit on the curry.
6907	873	Very good. I want to try with other fruit.
6908	873	Very nice when finally dehydrated.  It took 12 hours at 200 F.  Very tasty!
6909	873	It turned out terrible. The sugar caramelised leaving it with a burnt flavour. In wondering whether drying it at 150 in a fan oven was the right thing to do. I clearly did something wrong.
6910	873	I don't know what I did wrong,  but after 1 hour in the opened oven it was completely burnt to a crisp.
6911	873	not sure yet,I goofed and pureed so many batches I was tired.I forgot you have to cook it first but it has been in the oven 8 hrs. now and getting dryer so I still have hope.Especially after reading the post from one who set up a tent and let hers dry and took 2-3 days.Have my fingers crossed.......
6912	873	not sure yet,I goofed and pureed so many batches I was tired.I forgot you have to cook it first but it has been in the oven 8 hrs. now and getting dryer so I still have hope.Especially after reading the post from one who set up a tent and let hers dry and took 2-3 days.Have my fingers crossed.......
6913	873	Kids love it! I have to do things differently, so I sprinkled coconut flakes on top before drying in our dehydrator. We also used agave, but the original recipe is still very good.
6914	873	I blended the apricots first , they started turning brown pretty fast added the lemon juice and sugar and brought to a slow boil .  Removed from heat .
6916	874	The recipe is easy to make, totally not enough sugar or topping for the crumble. Will need to add more topping and for sure more sugar next time and I never knew apricots were so juicy!! Will try again with some adjustments.
6917	874	Yummy!  I used a 8x8 pan as my more than 4 cups of apricots left a lot if gaps in my 9x13 pan.  Probably contributed to it coming out very juicy and not as crisp.  Next time I would add the 1 T flour to the apricots as others suggested.  Will use again!
6918	874	This crumble was a hit!  I didn't add all the sugar to my cut fruit because I had tasted them and they weren't terribly bitter.  The end result was tart and sweet but next time I will add more than 1/8 c sugar.  I had 7cups of apricots but I didn't need to double the topping recipe - it was sufficient to spread all over. Would be great with berries as well.
6919	874	Tasted good.  Added 1Tb flour to apricots, but it still was soupy and the crisp sank so overall kinda of a waste of fresh apricots.  Would not make again.
6920	874	I liked this and will make it again.  However, BEWARE THE  AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR. The MAJOR  change I made is the amount of sugar.  This recipe calls for 3/4 c. of brown sugar in the topping. That seemed incredibly high so I checked a recipe I have for  a cranberry apple crisp which I make often.  That  recipe calls for only TWO tablespoons  packed brown sugar.  I can't imagine what this crisp would  taste like with 3/4 c.  of brown sugar.  I assume it would overpower the apricots and be way to sweet for my taste.  In terms of butter, I used the microwave to melt it rather than than cut it in.   Faster and easier.   I also followed the suggestions of others and added the almond extract and the flour and doubled the topping.
6921	874	Amazing although I used Honey-Nut granola instead of the rolled oats and it turned out delish! I put the brown sugar, flour, and butter in the food processor and then added the granola afterward to top the quartered apricots, then added more granola over the top. I baked in an 8x8 Pyrex for 30 min and it was perfect! Topped it with French Vanilla ice cream and it was an absolute hit!
6922	874	I made it exactly as written and it tasted great, but had too much liquid.  I read other reviews later and wish I’d added the flour for thickening.  I’ll do that next time and am sure it will be a better consistency.  I served it warm with a little scoop of vanilla-Carmel ice cream.  Perfect together!
6923	874	Wet gloppy mess. I even tossed the fruit in extra flour to absorb moisture. This did not get crispy, just a mushy dish of mush.
6924	874	It turned out thick and glopy. . Might have been better with different fruit
6925	875	One of our favorites.  I used green lentils, but I think red is better.  I also add a bit more cumin and thyme.  Don't forget the lemon juice.
6926	875	This was delicious! I made half a recipe, for just me and my husband. I used a beefsteak tomato instead of Roma and added a bit more chicken stock than called for, as it was a bit thick for us otherwise. I added a drizzle of fresh olive oil that my husband brought back from Italy, that was made from the olives of his mother's olive tree! Buonissimo!
6927	875	I make this almost weekly. It’s delicious! I use a can of diced tomatoes to make it easier and double the apricots. Enjoy!
6928	875	This is my new favorite soup! There is so much flavor, texture and depth to it. Each bite had a little something different. It was tangy, a little sweet, earthy and very fragrant.
6929	875	Outstanding taste!
6930	875	I used vegetable stock, added a cubed sweet pototoe, 1/2 cup of quinoa and doubled the cumin and garlic.  I did not have fresh tomato so I used a large can of cubed tomato.
6931	875	sautéed onions til almost carmelized, tripled spices as used water in place of broth to make it vegetarian, added both aleppo pepper and cayenne,  used can diced tomatoes
6932	875	I've been making this soup for over 20 years, after finding the recipe in a newspaper cooking section as 'Armenian Lentil and Apricot Soup'.  Even people who dislike the sludginess of lentils rave about this.  It's a breeze for the cook.  You can whip this up in less than an hour.
6933	875	Yummmm. This is delicious. I love apricot anything, so I had to give this a try. Flavors were great. I doubled the spices and added a little curry, like others before me. I also put in some sweet potatoes and used green lentils since I had them on hand. Will definitely make again. Very hearty!
6934	876	Taste (5 stars) was wonderful.  My bars were so runny that I had to eat them in bowl with a spoon.  Runny is (1 star) I have tried this recipe twice so next time I will reduce liquids by a lot.  I have drained about 1/4 C of liquid from this batch.
6935	876	5 stars for taste!  I deviated by using cashews, walnuts and chopped raisins.  You can do a lot with this basic recipe. I will use only one cup of coconut oil, and 1/4 cup honey next time though. Before I froze the concoction, wrapped up in parchment paper, I was worried it was too runny, but after freezing it hardened into a pleasant "candy bar" texture. Once frozen and cut into squares, it was amazing, very rich, sweet and nutty.
6936	876	Delicious frozen treat! I wasn't sure about the taste at first but once they were completely frozen, I became addicted! These are great when you are craving something sweet but want a to stick with a clean and healthy snack.
6937	876	I have an oat sensitivity so I was excited to find these! Im trying to stay away from refined sugars (including honey) so I replaced the honey by taking a cup of chopped dates and a cup of water & simmering until it was a paste (used an emersion blender to help it along).  I also added a dash of cardamom and used raw pumpkin seeds in place of sunflower seeds.  These basically taste like a really healthy dessert and I keep them in my freezer!  So excited to find these and will continue to change up the recipe :)
6938	876	I like the idea of an oat-free granola, seeing that I'm allergic to oats. This recipe won't let you down as far as taste goes. There is a bit too much oil and cinnamon for us, so next time I will certainly reduce those amounts. It makes a very large batch, keep that in mind. After two hours on the counter it had hardened into a loose granola. I ate that with a banana and some milk, like a cereal, and loved the taste. and crunch. After freezing it, I was able to cut it into bars, but they melt quickly. It is summer, so it is ok. A nice cool, healthy treat is not a problem. I don't know how well this will travel; but on top of cereal, ice cream, yogurt, etc., this is very good. Read the notes first for some good tips. I used dried cranberries instead of apricots. Thank you for the recipe.
6939	877	Super easy. The apricots and honey balance out the pork chops well.
6940	877	We really loved this! Don’t let the paper plate fool you — this is a classy dish! I used fresh apricots but first put the sauce ingredients on a saucepan  on low for about 15 min to get the fruit with the honey and garlic to blend together. I then sautéed the chops 4 min on one side and 3 on the other, added the warmed sauce to the pan and removed from heat and covered for 10 min. Chops were perfect!
6945	877	I didn’t have fresh apricots either so I used canned, drained but saved the juice and added a little of it to the end to make more juices for the rice to soak up.  I also added a little cayenne to one side of each chop to give it some kick...sweet and spicy over rice and served with asparagus.  This a keeper for sure.  It’s easy, pretty quick to fix and delicious.  My guys loved it.
6946	877	I used thick pork chops and it took a bit longer.  The recipe did not specify what size.  I loved it when I cut them thin and soaked them in the juice.  I would add more honey and didn't have fresh apricots so I used canned.  Pat dry them & used the whole can & glad I did.
6947	877	Wonderful and so easy.  I spent 6 hours painting our deck with my wife. While she showered, I prepared dinner!   She was amazed at a dinner that took 35 minutes to prepare but was so delicious!
6948	878	No I did not make any changes to the recipe. They're very good myself and my kids enjoy them.
6949	878	Recipe does not really work. The dough is too dry and impossible to fold. The recipe yields really ugly cookies with a mess with crumbs and sticky leaked jam on the tray and the plate. Will not make it again. Taste was ok but nothing special.
6950	878	Add 1/2 cup of milk just before mixing the dough.
6951	878	First horrible recipe from this site.  I’m so sad!  Not good!  Dry dough that wouldn’t hold together even after adding oil and water.  Not a good recipe!
6952	878	Yes, as other reviewers said - the dough is too dry.  Here's the thing.  My HOUSE is really dry right now.  I bet if I made them in the spring when all the windows are open, the dough would not be too dry.  If I make these again in the winter, I will reduce the flour to 2 1/2 cups, and see how that works.  I used a fork to seal the edges like my Italian sister-in-law did when making ravioli.
6953	878	I tried making these like half moon style and they weren't pretty but they tasted delicioys. the base dough for this is going to be my go to cookie dough, it's so yummy. but second time tried them thumb print style..delicious just takes a little longer to bake this way
6954	878	This is a great one!  I am just pulling them out of the oven. That's right on Christmas Eve a dared to make a new cookie!  I made a few a little on the big side.  Thought they would make a nice brunch item for tomorrow.  Merry Christmas!
6955	878	Cookies taste great.  For a smaller cookie and less prep time, I just rolled dough into small balls, pressed down and inserted the jam in a middle indent.  In my oven the bake time was 13 to 14 minutes
6956	878	Love these cookies.  I have been making these for years.
6957	879	I added brown sugar and more flour plus cinnamon to the reserved cake mix to make the crumb topping. I also added vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. I also used the juice from the fruit (I used peaches) to make the glaze.
6958	879	This is delicious! Easy to make, but impressive looking. Will be making this again.
6959	879	Followed recipe exactly. Thought it was very bland and unappealing looking. Did not care for the taste either.
6960	879	amazing.  I changed apricot to a jar of raspberry jam.
6961	879	Very moist and flavorful, but just a little too sweet for our taste.
6962	879	Such a creative recipe! I wouldn’t expect traditional danish or coffee cake texture from this recipe but as a breakfast cake in general or a pleasant dessert it’s a treat! The apricots aren’t very sweet and the cream cheese mixture could possibly use some pizzazz- the glaze is really essential to make the flavors come together. I used the apricot juice with the confectionery sugar instead of water and more than doubled the amount of liquid fir the glaze. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg to the box mix. Would love to make it again without using a packaged cake mix somehow. Will definitely make it again either way! & try some of the variations!! Thank you!!
6963	879	The big chunks of cream cheese were gross.  The cake mix tasted like birthday cupcakes.
6964	879	Did not come out anything like the picture. I followed all the directions exactly. Was a dissapointment.
6965	879	Great easy coffee cake! My modifications were: adding 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese mixture, and using Solo canned apricot filling. I also made my own style of icing (melted butter, powdered sugar, Carnation  milk, vanilla, pinch of salt). I’m thinking of trying a swirl technique next time to achieve a more even distribution of cheese & apricot. Looking forward to making other variations of this. Raspberry anyone?!
6966	880	The muffins had nice texture, the recipe wasn’t difficult, but I could not really taste the apricots.   I will try it again with a different brand of dried apricots.   I can see why people have added all sorts of things besides or in addition to the apricots.  There just wasn’t much taste beyond sweet.
6967	880	So good and very different from the standard muffins out there. No spices either, which can be a nice change. I could not wait and had one that was still warm with some butter spread. I did make this in six jumbo muffins and one mini loaf pan. For the buttermilk, I used a dry cultured buttermilk blend. I needed to bake a few minutes more. The bottoms were getting brown, so I'm thinking maybe lower the temp and cook longer? Thanks for this great recipe!
6968	880	Delicious! A moist and flavorful muffin recipe. I added zest from half an orange and a 1/2 cup of flaked coconut for a tropical tasting muffin. I topped the muffins off with raw sugar. I also made this into a loaf; it took 35 minutes. Will definitely make again.
6969	880	A cake apricot muffin, yum. I used a combo of Solo apricot filling and chopped dried apricots- it’s what I have right now with our Shelter in Place restrictions right now with the Coronavirus. I added turbinado sugar to the top and a tsp of baking powder. I baked them at 425 degrees for 5 min. then 375 degrees for about 12 min. I do that to get my muffins high and crusty on top. Next time I think I’ll add a little less sugar and maybe soak the apricots in orange juice or add the zest of a lemon because I’d like a little bit of a kick.
6970	880	I made this yesterday and kept the recipe exactly the same except used 1/2 of a 14oz can of apricots, drained them well and cut in smaller pieces (they came cut in half). I gently mixed them in to the batter at the end and then added the crumb topping from the blueberry buttermilk coffee cake ( 3/4 sugar and 3/4 flour and 6 tsp of butter mixed to crumble consistency) and put plenty on top. I used a tin for 6 large muffins and baked for 25 minutes in my oven, but need to check often.  They came out great, loved the little moist pieces of apricot with the texture of the crunchy crumb topping.
6971	880	Delicious recipie, did not change a thing other than I added 1 tsp. Of baking powder by accident, as it goes in most other muffin recipies.  They were delicious, make sure you use buttermilk as recommended.  If you take them out after 15 minutes, they will be raw inside.  I actually had to bake mine for an extra 8 minutes.  15 min. Is not enough.
6973	880	I made this recipe using 1 cup chopped fresh apricots instead of dried apricots soaked in boiling water.  Everything else was the same. The muffins turned out perfectly.
6974	880	I doubled ingredients to make 24 muffins for our church group - ended up with 36!  baked in convection oven for 18 minutes, dusted top of each muffin with cinnamon sugar before baking (I'm a cinnamon freak). YUMMY
6975	881	Delish! I've been using this recipe for years - if you can't find Russian dressing, you can sub in Catalina dressing instead.
6976	881	Sauce was incredible.  Pork chops were dry as they don't need cooking near an hour.
6977	881	I made it as is & served it  with Baked Diced Sweet Potatoes & Baked Zucchini.  TOTAL OUT OF THE PARK HOMERUN!!  It's already been added to our rotation...
6978	881	Our favorite  recipe for pork chops.
6979	881	Excellent!  I used Apricot pineapple preserves and found a recipe and made the Russian dressing from scratch and it was very good.  My husband even said he loved it.  Definitely something that will be made again.  ??
6980	881	I followed the directions exactly and it was delicious! Pork chops were tender and sauce was delicious- not too sweet.  Served with broccoli and veggie rice.... yum!
6981	881	I love the taste of it..I used Catalina dressing since I couldn’t find Russian dressing..it tastes almost like sweet and sour..my 13yr old who’s picky asked what the sauce was and said it’s different..he gave it 2 thumbs up..I didn’t do anything different to the recipe and followed as is..it’s delicious
6982	881	These pork chops are so good. Another go to recipe.  AllRecipes you are making me look good with my dinner guests.
6983	881	kinda sweet. I feel like the sauce could have used something more. The cook time was a little long and the meat was a bit tough. I'd go a shorter next time, maybe 35 minutes.
6984	882	I used this glaze for Easter and everyone raved about it.  The sweet orange/apricot flavor tasted great with the ham!
6985	882	My husband asked me to use this everytime I make a ham now.  It stuck to the ham even when it was hot so the glaze really set in.  Very good.
6986	882	It was sooo good. Not too sweet and there was extra to put on the side or especially great with the left over ham.
6987	882	I followed the recipe and it was good but not amazing.
6988	882	Good stuff! I didn’t have any orange juice, so I used lemonade and it worked fine. lol
6989	882	This glaze turned out great! The flavor wasn’t too sweet or too spicy, but a really good mixture of both. 5/5 liked this in our family so I’m sure we’ll make this again sometime. The only bad part was I had to cook the ham a lot longer than originally thought, so some of the glaze just ended up being kind of burned and hardened. I will have to work on a better method to get the texture right.
6990	882	I improvised this basic recipe since I did not have anything except the honey.  I used the zest of one clementine and some of the pulp with agave nectar for the marmalade.  I used duck sauce for the apricot/peach jam.  It still was marvelous.  I gave it only 4 stars because I don't know what it would have been like if I used the right ingredients.
6991	882	very different , loved it.
6992	882	I made wh peach jam
6993	883	The Apricot Brandy Pound Cake was a big hit!
6994	883	I made it, delicious
6995	883	I have the exact recipe from a Georgia church cookbook.  I have been making it for years.  It is my favorite pound cake.  It is always moist and with all the extracts, it has so much flavor, they all blend together to make it great!  It also freezes very well.
6996	883	Excellent cake and indeed did freeze well as it spent 5 days well-wrapped in the freezer before being defrosted and decorated.   I baked it as one layer in a Wilton "lamb" pan.  It was somewhat heavy (unbleached all purpose flour) but moist and delicious.  The recipe is versatile as well.  Since I did not have apricot brandy on hand, I soaked a few dried apricots in rum then pureed them in my food processor.   Worked beautifully!
6997	883	Excellent pound cake!  I doubled up on most of the extracts as suggested by some.  Made it for my nephews 28th birthday.  my sister called and asked what mojo had I put in the batter...lol.  It's definitely a keeper.
6998	883	Wonderful recipe.  I made it for an office party, and it got rave reviews.  It was a real crowd-pleaser.  I made mine with apricot nectar rather than brandy, but added in a couple of big spoonfuls of apricot preserves.  I also used an apricot almond glaze, made with 1/4 cup apricot nector, 1-1/2 cups powdered sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  I loved the texture and the flavor.
6999	883	Love, love this recipe!!  I have the exact recipe given to me by my great-grandmother!!  You can not go wrong with this recipe--it is absolutely Delicious!! At the bottom of my recipe, my great-grandmother wrote--"Keeps well-If you hide it!!"
7000	883	Love this cake it is so moist and favorful
7001	883	My family has made this cake for decades; the recipe from my grandmother is exactly the same except for 1/2 tsp. almond extract and baking 80 minutes instead of 60.
7002	884	This recipe is AMAZING.  My family loves it as much as I do.  It has a very unusual flavor.  Unique maybe because we don't have Moroccan cousins? (IDK).  But the multitude of spices, oy vey!  I had to buy $30 worth of spices I did not have - much  to my wife's chagrin.   I like lamb, but the lamby taste is replaced by piquancy of the spices and apricot.  It's wonderful.
7003	884	Really fabulous. I added carrots and chickpeas. It was a hit
7004	884	The recipe is fantastic. I made it a couple times with addition to adding veggies.. At the last 30 minutes I  put in 1 bunch of  cut up kale, zucchini, can gabonzo beans, red bell pepper and diced sweet potato. It was more filling of a stew.
7005	884	I made this tonight for my 84 yr old Mom and brother as well as myself.
7006	885	Easy enough. My grandmother made this cake and we all loved it. This recpie is not quite her recipe.  For a box cake base, it's good.
7007	885	Added lemon juice & apricot nectar to glaze. Next time, I want to try the lemon cake mix with apricot jello- just because I like apricot. As is, recipe works great. Nice tangy lemony flavor. Agree that poppy seeds would be a nice add in.
7008	885	This was one of my dad's favorites. Suggestions: 1)Eliminate the water and jello step altogether.  Perhaps, that will correct the extra moisture issue that some reported.
7033	889	Complete yes!  I did reduce the apricot jam to about 1/3 of a cup and I wouldn't have wanted it sweeter than that.  I loved the taste and texture of the dried apricots and they really added something to the dish.  There was probably too much chicken broth because it was still swimming in sauce, so maybe I'd only use 1/2 cup next time.  It would still cook the chicken but be less "soupy".
7009	885	I've been making this cake for over 30 years. It wouldn't be Easter in our family without it. It is heavenly! Some suggestions for those who have had issues with the recipe. Cut the oil in half and it will turn out fine. Use the cooking spray with flour in it to lessen sticking. I cut the glaze recipe by a third and I poke the still-warm cake all over with a fork and slowly pour the glaze on. You don't want to use a cool cake as the crust hardens and won't absorb the glaze as easily. I also put the cake on a cake stand with a lip on it and glaze the cake with parchment strips under it until glazing is done. However, this is meant to have a drippy look anyway.
7010	885	I HAVE MADE A VERSION OF THIS CAKE FOR YEARS; IT WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE,AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE CAKES IN GENERAL, LOVE IT. FOR THE PAST 3 1/2 YEARS, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND KERN'S APRICOT NECTAR HERE IN LOUISIANA;  YESTERDAY I FOUND IT IN A LOCAL STORE, AND TODAY I'M BAKING THIS CAKE AS A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR MY 96 YR. OLD AUNT.  I WILL MAKE ANOTHER ONE AS SOON AS I FINISH, BECAUSE I NEED MY "FIX" AFTER 3 1/2 YRS. OF NOT BEING ABLE TO BAKE IT!~IT IS SO MOIST AND IMPROVES WITH AGE. I USE LEMON SUPREME CAKE MIX, AND A BOX OF APRICOT JELLO MIX; I MIX THE JELLO (DRY) WITH MY CAKE MIX, BEFORE ADDING THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. I ALSO USE ONE CUP OF WESSON OIL AND ONE CUP OF APRICOT NECTAR. I MIX MY GLAZE WITH APRICOT NECTAR AND LEMON JUICE; I POKE HOLES IN THE CAKE WHILE STILL IN THE PAN, AND POUR HALF THE GLAZE ON THE CAKE WHILE STILL WARM;  THEN, I USE THE LAST HALF OF THE GLAZE TO DRIZZLE OVER THE CAKE AFTER IT IS REMOVED FROM THE PAN AND COOLED. TOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED IN THIS VERSION!
7011	885	moist, sweet, pound perfect lemony-heaven!  Added poppyseeds was a complete hit.  My son shoveled the last 3 pieces into his mouth the next day as he shot out the door to be left unseen.  Thank you!
7012	885	Great recipe used mango nectar, orange jell-o followed instructions let bake for 60min. icing a little to lemoney for me but really moist and fluffy great taste!right in the recipe box.Great again!
7013	885	This cake totally fell apart on me!  It was such a waste of time...almost 2 hours spent and I have no dessert to bring for easter dinner!  I am going to attempt to make frosting and frost it back together...
7014	885	Easy and Tasty. No-stick spray worked fine.  I used canola oil and reduced it to 1/2 cup since it's thinner than vegetable oil.  It's my Dad's favorite, so I made him one for father's day.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up.
7015	886	Easy to follow.
7016	887	This is absolutley delicious, the best I have made in awhile! Tried adding a little Hawaiian Chili Pepper water for that extra zing! Ono
7017	887	We didn't have time to marinate over night.  So, cook it in the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  Turned out GREAT!!!  Thank you for the recipe.
7018	887	Delicious! Everybody loved it
7019	887	Made exactly as described and it was perfect!
7020	888	I've made these a number of times and now I improvise on the ingredients.  So great for a grab and go for after my run.
7021	888	I added a half teaspoon salt. I didn't have any of the dried fruits so just subbed dried cherries. I made a few other substitutions and these turned out fine. This recipe is an easily adaptable one.
7022	888	Mine turned out a bit "bready", not sure why.  I used an 8"x8" pan instead of the 9"x13" so it was thicker and I baked it for a total of 40 minutes (20 minutes in, rest for 10, then another 20 minutes in the oven).   I added 1/8-1/4 cup of chia seeds in lieu of some of the other items.  I see pictures others posted that look similar and others that actually look like a "bar" which is what I was after.  Still, very tasty and easy to substitute items for personal flavors/wants.
7023	888	I added 1/4 tsp salt and 2 Tbsp molasses as another reader suggested. I substituted prunes for dates and pecans for the walnuts. I felt this could still use a bit of sweetness. Might add some cinnamon and more fruit next time. Dried mango perhaps. 4 stars because of it's versatility. With a bit of tweeking, anyone can make this recipe to suit their personal taste!
7024	888	We liked these a lot, following the recipe exactly. I am especially intrigued with how versatile this recipe is just by swapping out some ingredients. I agree with some other reviews that it would be even better with a little salt.
7025	888	What I love about this recipe is its versatility and "forgiveability" :)  We are a gluten-free and caesin-free family so finding and developing recipes everyone can not only eat but love is hard. This recipe fits the bill perfectly.  Even though there are supposed GF oats available my family can not tolerate them so I just substituted various nuts for the weight value and used our GF all-purpose flour blend. I also read the other reviews and added 1/4 tsp of salt, peanut butter and vanilla.  Wow - a huge hit in our family.  Never buying "Lara" bars again :)
7026	888	This is a very easy recipe with great results. So far I have made it twice. I agree with other reviewers that a little salt (1/4 teaspoon) improves the flavor.  Very flexible recipe.
7027	888	Very Good! My mixture was a little "loose", so I thought it wasn't going to bake well, but it did. Instead of maple syrup, I used Agave nectar. Also, I added some coconut and a few chocolate chips. This recipe is very versatile! Delicious!
7028	888	These were awesome!  My kids devoured them.  Moist, sweet and packed with good things.  I made minor substitutions: regular rolled oats, more apricots instead of dates, unsweetened coconut instead of walnuts, honey instead of maple syrup.  I love that they have no refined sugar.   No peanut butter means they can be sent as a school snack.
7029	889	Very good, its a keeper. Family loved it.
7030	889	I read the reviews and added 10 apricots and 1/4 cup preserves   I also added a little Dijon mustard.   This was a good recipe.   My family liked it but did not rave about it.   I may make again in the future   Thank you for the recipe
7031	889	This recipe was not very good in my humble opinion.  I thought it was too sweet even though I cut the jam in half and used jam for diabetics (no added sugar).  I also felt something was missing from the recipe.  The chicken cut into pieces was also a bit much.  I think if the chicken breasts were left whole, browned, and then braised in the sauce, it might be better both flavor and presentation-wise.  I wonder if it would be better with added sliced carrots and/or red bell pepper, while cutting down on the amount of dried apricots.  I also wonder if adding some cumin, cayenne, and maybe a small amount of cinnamon might give the sauce a warmer, more complex profile to balance the sweetness.
7032	889	Love this and so does the boyfriend, so its a win for us! I do add an extra splash of balsalmic, but make it as written otherwise. Served over rice with the sauce is heavenly. Definitely a quick, straightforward staple.
7034	889	Used peaches instead of apricots
7035	889	Love this recipe.  Will definitely make it again.
7036	889	This was delicious. I used apricot preserves instead of fresh apricot .
7037	889	Very tasty but had way too much liquid at the end of the cooking time.  Added a Tbs of corn starch to thicken a bit
7038	890	This recipe was amazing. I followed it to a T except I added a bit more amaretto to the pulp and made stabilized whipped cream to decorate it! Everyone loved it, as did I!
7039	890	Making it again right now!!
7040	890	Linda makes the best cakes I have ever had. You will never go wrong with here receipe.
7041	891	This recipe is very close to Mother In Law’s, so I can’t wait to see what she thinks 🙏🏻? At 92, she gotten a bit more critical, but i really think she’ll love. My husband put her handwritten recipe away somewhere, never to be seen again. I’ll update soon. I’ve made many variations of the standard sweet (though we prefer ours a bit less sweet), of traditional kugel/noodle pudding.⚠️Tip: Apricot & other nectars in the single 12 oz. (?) can is often easily found in most grocery stores, in the juice aisle or often in the aisle with Latin/Hispanic foods, with juices. You can also easily substitute peach, pineapple, apple or even jams or preserves of again, your flavor preference.I recommend slightly warming your jams/preserves first to loosen them up, so they’ll easily mix in with the rest of your ingredients. Don’t let them become too hot though, just warm enough to loosen them. Remember, this dish is easily adaptable to whatever flavor profile you prefer. But keep it fairly simple.Enjoy!
7042	891	Funny thing is that I was at the Ventura County Fair in 01' with my cousins from the Garmon Ranch. I followed the recipe except for the apricot nectar (yep, try finding that) so I used spreadable apricot fruit in place of it. This turned out addictingly good. Thank you Diane for a great recipe.
7043	891	I've been making this for years, it's a fabulous recipe that I share regularly with colleagues, friends, family, really anyone who mentions kugel, or anything that reminds me of kugel, or if they say apricot. Or noodle. You get the idea!!
7044	891	This had way too much apricot-it overpowered the dish. I may try it again with less and see how it goes.
7045	891	This was good but a little tto sweet for my taste. I would cut the sugar in half next time.
7046	891	I'm not a big fan of sweet kugel, but my guests liked this a lot. I added chopped dried apricots and omitted the topping - it was totally fine without, and the edges of the noodles sticking out on top got nice and crispy. This is definitely a dessert - quite sweet and pretty rich. Next time I'd probably cut down the white sugar by half, since the nectar adds a lot of sweetness. Also, the middle never set, so I might add an extra egg?
7047	891	This is one of the best kugal receipes I've ever made.  It was a hugh hit with my family!  I plan on making this often.
7048	891	Unbelievable - so delish. I cut down on the butter though - it was just too much - and next time I might cut even more. I didn't have white sugar, so I used brown and it was fantastic.
7049	891	I didn't follow this exactly - but I used the basic amounts for a quick kugel with the ingredients I had on hand.  I used a 12-oz box of tri-color twist pasta. I left out the apricot nectar and raisins - and even with a reduced amt of sugar it was plenty sweet for us. The rest was like the recipe but with a bit more cream cheese and 4 eggs instead of 3.  I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar for a topping. Came out great!
7050	892	I've been experimenting with different hamantaschen recipes. They all taste pretty much the same but the difference is in how easy the dough rolls out. This worked well for me and will be my go-to recipe.I added a little water and also some vanilla. I used my stand mixer to blend the dough. I also used prune lekvar that I had previously made, but I'm sure this recipe  would have been delicious.I refrigerated the dough overnight because I didn't have time to finish putting the hamantaschen together.
7051	892	These were GREAT! The best part was the lemon and orange zest!. I also agree to not use more than 1tsp of filling. DELICIOUS!
7052	892	Great! Having said that I changed it like completely mostly out of necessity of what I had. I used canola oil, only a half rind of lemon, and a splash of orange juice instead of orange rind. I wouldn't necessarily vouch for any of these except to say it still worked so don't worry if you need to sub.
7053	892	Great recipe but made a few changes. Didn't have an orange or walnuts so left them out. Lemon juice & rind worked well with a filling of Allrecipes "sauteed apples" (finely chopped with extra spices.)
7054	892	I struggled mightily with this dough, and I acknowledge that my poor baking skills may have had everything to do with it. I also had a TON of filling leftover, I think perhaps you could do half as much? Overall these still turned out pretty decent despite my user troubles, so it seems this is a pretty good recipe.
7055	892	The traditional Hamantaschen I have had are a softer. I  cut down on the baking powder as suggested however the dough did spread significantly. Be sure to brush corners with water & pinch tightly. Although it is a good recipe, I wonder if a Rx with butter would yield a softer mouth feel.
7056	892	rolled out to 1/4" and it was a little bready.  Lots of leftover filling.  Used double the amount of walnuts.  Dough was alittle dry, had to add water.  Baked for 30 min
7057	892	These turned out great. I used a gluten free flour, adding only  xanthan gum, and refrigerated the dough for two hours before working with it.  The only change I would make next time is there is too way too much filling for dough if you roll to a 1/4 inch...I would try 1/8 inch next time.
7058	892	This is a fantastic recipe which yielded my best tasting and looking Hamentaschen, ever. I did not have a lemon, so I used the zest of two oranges; plus I substituted fig jam, Nutella and chocolate chips as fillings. I exactly followed the directions and these turned out beautifully, with no leaks or overbakes.  Happy Purim and thank you for the recipe.
7059	893	Moist and flavorful 2 lb roast. Nice presentation on slicing. I opted to try Meyer lemon jelly instead of apple, as I had canned quite a lot of it. The sauce was on the sweet side, as I imagine it is intended to be, but not lemony. I did baste every 20 minutes, and add a tiny bit of broth, as others suggested to keep the drippings from scorching. A keeper. Thank you.
7060	893	We made this for Thanksgiving dinner in lieu of ham or turkey and it was AHHHHHHHMAZING!  it seems so fancy but was easy to put together .  I was afraid a pork loin would be just so dry but this cooking method makes sure it doesn't dry out at all.  The only changes I made were the omission of all salt and I left out the apple jelly from the port wine sauce since I didn't want it too sweet.  It was all just perfect and will definitely be a do again recipe!
7061	893	This recipe is great. Leaving a comment not only because it was awesome, but also it was impossible to find Apple jelly for the glaze that goes on the pork just before it heads into the oven. I used peach preserves.  Any preserve that goes with rosemary would work. Think that through before you get too creative. ;-)
7062	893	Great flavourful pork recipe! Be sure to monitor the temperature closely because overdone lean pork will be very dry. The port sauce is a real winner!
7063	893	I used two pork tenderloins for a dinner party of four. I was able to do all ahead that morning except for sauce at the end. It was, without doubt, the best pork I’ve ever eaten... gourmet, totally gourmet. All three guests raved
7064	893	This recipe was amazing! I served a 5 lb pork loin for New Years Day dinner for 12.  I roasted the garlic before using it in this recipe, substituted peach pepper jelly for the apple jelly, and left out the cranberries. I fileted the roast, spread the filling over it, then rolled it like a pinwheel. For the sauce, I used a full cup of port but let it simmer and reduce while the roast was cooking.  Everyone loved it!
7065	893	Will be making this many timescale in the feature.
7066	893	Made using 2 pounds pork tenderloin and scaling back ingredients.  Having temps to check was do helpful in decreasing cooking time.  Made double sauce recipe. LOVED it.
7067	893	This was absolutely stunning. I made it as a special meal for my husband on father's day. Instead of one huge pork loin I used 2 small ones, totaling 4 pounds. I used the same amount of stuffing and based on the reviews doubled the sauce. I was not disappointed! The sauce was a hit, and the pork was cooked perfectly. As long as you use an actual meat thermometer and cook to the right temperatures this will turn out properly, juicy, and perfectly cooked.
7068	894	Mine was a little on the tart side ( apricots less sweet?) so I added a tablespoon of honey.   It came out great!!  I used it on everything from toast to tacos to hot dogs!
7069	894	Yummy!  I thought it would be spicier, but still good!
7070	894	Pretty good! I had gotten a bunch of apricots in a food share and wanted to use them. Not really an apricot fan, but gave this a shot and I am glad I did! Easy to make, and I’m thinking it will be better after sitting overnight. All real food. Served over chicken for dinner tonight, and may use as an actual salsa with chips at lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a nice fresh recipe!
7071	894	Very tasty! I took it to a BBQ and everybody loved it!
7072	894	This was a refreshing change, but I have to say make sure your apricots are not too ripe or the salsa will become too mooshy/saucy. Also it tends to discolor a tiny bit overnight. I ended up increasing the pineapple and adding some chopped fresh jalapeno instead of habanero. The rest of the ingredients I added to taste.
7073	894	My tree had an over abundance of apricots this year.  I have a party to go to and thought this sounded tasty so I doubled the recipe.  My husband couldn't get over the flavor and even later came in and said what a great taste it left in his mouth.  I make lots of salsas and let's just say, half of the salsa I made for the party is staying home, I am not sharing.  Can't wait to try on a pork tenderloin tomorrow for dinner.
7074	894	Excellent! Pairs extremely well with the "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" recipe on this site.
7075	894	This was my first attempt at any sort of salsa and I am REALLY pleased with how it came out. It's an amazing blend of sweet and spicy. I added a second Habanero pepper and a little bit more cilantro and pineapple and it was a MAJOR success!
7076	895	It's Delicious!!!  one problem, I can never get my dough to fill the pan no matter how thin i try to roll out the dough.
7077	895	This recipe is too sweet!!!
7078	895	Tastes amazing and impressive looking!  My Grandmother used to make this recipe, I had bits and pieces of her old recipe but not the entire thing.  So I tried this and it was just as amazing as I remember her cookies years ago!  I used more apricot preserves, 2 - 12 oz cans.  It’s  a fancy cookie that tastes as good as they look!  It’s worth the time to make these!
7079	895	Fam favorite for many years. You can use jam for both layers if nuts are not an option.
7080	895	Sorry for being the minority here but we did not want seconds of these.   Although, it was very beautifully layered and presentable.
7081	895	I hve been making this recipe since I was 13. It's a favorite of my fathers. I use either two jars of apricot preserves or 1 jar apricot and 1 jar pineapple preserves. The pineapple helps with the tartness of the apricot. I tried blueberry as well as a strawberry version but we like the apricot/ pineapple best.
7082	895	Big hit with my history  class. It got me a A+! My family also thought it was amazing. Easy, simple, delicious.
7083	895	This Torte was absolutely delicious.  I found that it tasted better several days after I baked it.  This Torte keeps wonderfully without going too dry.  Will definitely bake again and again and again.
7084	895	Absolutely incredible!!  By far one of the best desserts. My husband made it for my birthday, and it was perfectly not too sweet and the layers were delicious!!!
7085	897	I made this exactly as written except I garlic salted and peppered the chicken before frying.   It was delicious.   If you fry the chicken brown, your sauce gets to be a deep garnet color because when you add the broth the brown bits on the bottom loosen up and blend into the broth.  Just stack your chicken on top of each other, add the broth, soy sauce  , then the preserves and whisk away until most of the jam is incorporated.  Put your chicken back in the simmering broth and then,  after 10 minutes or so, add the cornstarch mixture and as soon as it thickens turn it to low until it’s nice and thick.  Suprsingly tasty!!
7086	897	delicious
7087	897	It was tasty, and will keep for another day. It wasn't too difficult to make.
7088	897	Based on the recipe it is basic recipe and a bit bland and a bit sweet for me....I added 1/8 ginger 1/8 cardamom 1/2 lemon, chopped 12 dried apricots. soaked in water. Next time use 1/2 cups of preserves.....Thanks and Happy Cooking!!!
7089	897	Easy to make. Good flavor - not overly sweet. Made great leftovers. Served one riced cauliflower.
7090	897	I liked it, but I don't think I'll make it again. It wasn't as good as other things I could have made.
7091	897	I just made it and it was so moist and tender.  It had a great mild flavor
7092	897	Wonder full dinner! Quick and easy dinner will be making this again!
7093	897	Turned out great and had a lot of flavor!
7094	898	Loved this sauce but next time I may add a little ginger.
7095	898	Family loved it... chopped apricots a little larger, measured generously for apricots and raisins. Gelled more overnight, better the second day
7096	898	This is a fantastic recipe! I made it just as is with no substitutions it was awesome!
7097	898	Family favorite. Can taste all the flavors and not to sweet.
7098	898	I love pecans with all this sweetness, so I added 1 cup. Delicious!
7099	898	So easy to bake and so delicious. I added dried cranberries instead or apricots.
7100	898	Our daughter in law makes this and we love it. Gonna miss them this year and making this will make us smile anyway. Happy Thanksgiving to Gunny Carol
7101	898	I substituted clementines for the orange juice and zest, and I replaced some of the water for cooking with the apple cider I had on hand.  Sorry to say I didn't measure everything exactly. I had a 12 oz. bag of cranberries, so I may have used a little less sugar than what the recipe called for.
7102	898	It is a good receipe.  I used orange liqueur in place of orange juice.  The taste was amazing.
7103	899	5.6.21 Made exactly as written and was quite happy with the way this recipe turned out.  That little bit of nutmeg adds some interest, and the only additional thing that I added was a little salt.  Next time, I might try melting the butter and apricot preserves together to make the mixture easier to mix.  We love carrots, and this one’s a keeper.
7104	899	This is delicious!!  Made it using baby carrots because that is what I had on hand.  Will definitely make again.
7105	899	I followed the recipe and it was quite good!
7106	899	This is a really unique and tasty recipe. I was worried it would too sweet for my tastes, which is the reason I don't like traditional glazed carrots, but the lemon juice and orange zest really balanced it out perfectly. I used baby carrots, which ended up taking 20 minutes to boil. There actually ends up being more sauce than needed for the carrots, and we didn't want to waste it once the carrots were eaten. We used the leftover sauce for fish and rice, and I can imagine it might go well on chicken too. I made this recipe because I'm trying to eat more vegetables despite not liking them, and this was a definitive win, I will be making it again.
7107	899	Very good, simple and tasty.
7108	899	We did not like this recipe at all.  I think it would be better to make the preserves into a glaze instead of a sort of watery dressing that didn't really flavor the carrots.
7109	899	We had this with our Easter dinner and it's great!  Husband likes it so much he's taking the recipe to work so he can make it for his coworkers (fire dept so they eat meals together)!  We substituted the orange zest with orange juice, other than that, just followed the recipe.
7110	899	Wonderful to spring on the dinner table!  Even those who snub carrots will enjoy this dish.  And, easy to make.  I par-cooked the carrots the night before so all I had to do on Thanksgiving was to "finish it up".
7111	899	These were yummy. I will make again, but will either omit or lessen the orange zest. It turned out very citrusy. A little citrusy would have been good.
7112	492	Because it was just for the two of us,  i used a very thick boneless pork chop cutting a space dwon the center. Didn't have apricots so used yellow raisins.  Very tasty.
7113	492	I have provided this roast a few times now. I always get great reviews.
7114	492	This roast turned out very good. I followed directions except that I used orange marmalade and cranberries from freezer for the stuffing . May have been a little overdone as it was hard to position the meat thermometer with the filling in the middle. Would definitely try again
7115	492	Nothing special.
7116	492	Very good.  Might use less cinnamon
7117	492	Not a bad recipe.  The flavors just didn't go over well in my family at all.  I should have listened when a lot of the reviews talked about using this dish for Christmas dinner.  That's about the only time I could see making this again.  Just not an everyday kind of dish.
7118	492	I've been making this dish, (or some variation) for 30 years. It's a wonderful main dish for any occasion. I'm making it for Christmas this year.
7119	492	I did alter the recipe.  I only had fresh figs and apples.  So, that is what I used.  I omitted the  cumin.  It was excellent!
7120	492	made this a few months ago,  the spices were too much,  and the fruit could have been better.  since then over made a bunch of changed and made a completely different recipe for a stuffed loin.
7121	901	I omitted the orange peel and used 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I also chopped up 1/4 cup dried apricots and set them in 3/4 cup boiling water while the potatoes were boiling.  When I made the sauce, I added the apricots (with the water they were reconstituted in) after the sauce thickened. I found Jumex apricot nectar in the soft drink section of the grocery store. It comes in a 12-oz. can. I used the entire can and omitted the 1/2 cup water listed in the recipe. This makes a lot of sauce, so sometimes when I take it somewhere I use 6 pounds of potatoes for the same amount of sauce. And every time I take it somewhere, I get multiple requests for the recipe.
7122	901	I have made this every Thanksgiving for many years.  I cut the potatoes into strips and arrange in  the casserole with drained apricot halves and whole pecans (see other photos).  I cut the brown sugar a bit and use one recipe of the sauce for 4 to 5 large potatoes.  This method keeps the sweetness and calories down a bit.  I now also use the drained syrup from the apricots instead of the nectar to make a clearer, shiny glaze.
7123	901	I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, it was delicious!  I will be making this again.
7124	901	My husband loved it, he said it tastes like deserty pumpkin dishes. I liked it less, expecting a little more crisp to it. I used only half the brown sugar and it was sweat enough.
7125	901	Instead of the traditional Sweet Potato Casserole, I prepared this dish on Christmas Day.  Everyone thought it was fantastic.  Needless to say, this will be the dish I prepare on holidays from now on.
7126	901	These are the best sweet potatoes ever! I made them for Christmas dinner and loved them. I forgot to add the pecans and they were still so goood!
7127	901	I made this the other night and my husband, Rick & I liked them. They are very sweet. The next I make them I’m going to use less brown sugar and use the juice from the orange and cut the apricot juice by the same amount..  We are planning on taking these to our family Thanksgiving get together this week.
7128	901	This is sooooo good!!!  My 9 year old daughter took one bite and said "Mom, this sauce would be great on carrots!"  I am excited for leftovers tomorrow, I bet they will be even better!
7129	901	This review is long over due.  I love sweet potatoes any way they're cooked.  I've eaten & baked sweet potato casseroles most of my adult life, but nothing touches this.  I'm not a fan of marshmellows so decided to give this recipe a try.  I Took it to a pot luck for our square dance club's Christmas dinner.  Wow!  They loved it.  Dish was empty by the time I got to it.  This will be my sweet potato casserole recipe from now on.
7130	902	I am curious who posted this recipe and it’s history. I have made this every year since 2002. The family won’t let me get by without making it. Always excellent reviews from everyone. My kids have grown up on it, and now my grandkids. A big thank you to whoever posted it over 20 years ago. All I can say is try it, you won’t be disappointed!
7131	902	FABULOUS! For the past few years I had been using the Maple Glazed Turkey recipe from this site (which is wonderful), but this year I wanted to try something new. I followed the directions exactly, except I adjusted for my smaller turkey. The results were incredible! Hands down the best gravy (if you take the time to follow that portion of the recipe) I have ever tasted. My family agreed.
7132	902	I have been making this recipe for the last 15 years, since everybody loves it.  I did make a few changes, albeit minor ones.
7133	902	This is a keeper. I've done other recipes but keep coming back to this. The gravy is outstanding. I have read that some folks think it's extra effort but I say "nay nay" .... If you like to cook, this is simple. I LOVE to cook and it's effortless. You get what you put into it, right? Thanks for sharing the recipe (no matter where it originated, as stated by a previous reviewer).  It's awesome.....period.
7134	902	Turned out awesome. We even added some habonaro to the apricot glaze.
7135	902	Delicious. I did cook it breast down so the breat would be juicy. My family was really impressed and loved the taste. It seemed to be a lot of work. It’s was worth it and definitely will make again. Thanks for the recipe!
7136	902	Overall I'm really glad I made this.  The glaze wasn't overly sweet and although the rub kept the meat moist it didn't really get flavor into the meat.  The gravy had definate onion/shallot flavor and was very good over mashed potatoes.
7137	902	I have been making this for 13 years and my family loves it! I’ve never thought to use any other recipe. Thanks!!
7138	902	I make this every year for Thanskgiving and it makes a beautiful looking and amazing tasting bird.  I always have tons of leftover glaze and freeze it for next time.  I go light so it's not over powering the turkey and gravy flavor.  We absolutely LOVE the gravy.  My kids won't eat it but they won't eat any type of gravy.  If you purchase a 22 pound bird the times listed are spot on.  Can't wait to make it again this year!
7139	903	I added two tablespoons of bourbon to the apricot preserves which gave the glaze a delightful taste.
7140	903	Yes, I would make it again.  I just mixed the apricot  and honey mustard together and smeared it on a slow cooked ham and put it under the broiler for 5 min.  Easy.
7141	903	I made this glaze with a small pinch of ground clove. It was perfect, everyone ate, even my picky little one.
7142	903	I've made this twice - no cloves.  Very good, not too sweet.
7143	903	We made this with the full amount of glaze for a 4 lb. Ham. We also studded the ham with whole cloves before baking. It was delicious with the cloves adding a wonderful complement to the sweetness of the glaze.
7144	903	I thought this turned out very good.  I didn't use the cloves because I was out.     I did add about one tbs. of plum sauce.
7145	904	I have  made this cake twice since Thanksgiving. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter. It was tasty, everyone like it, and it was completely gone in 4 days. The second time, I tweaked the recipe to my liking and made a raspberry/orange glaze of my own invention and within 2 days it was gone!
7146	904	The cake was very moist and it was a huge hit.
7147	904	What a very yummy cake this is!  I halved this, cooking it in a mini Bundt pan (an 8 cup size).  I can't imagine making the whole thing unless you have a super-sized crowd to sample it.  I skipped step 6 (which isn't even listed in the ingredients anyway), and I chose to include the zest IN the final glaze while leaving off the almonds on top.  I did use twice the amount of zest for each of the three segments.  I consider those changes to be minor ones.  If making the smaller cake, check for doneness at about 50 minutes (the touch test--if the top springs back lightly at touch, it's done).  I used a chop stick to make the holes to let the syrup seep in.  I thought this was a very good cake!  Thanks for this recipe!  EDIT:  I made a reduction of apricot nectar mixed with a little limoncello.  I served the cake with a little vanilla ice cream on top with the reduction drizzled down over it.  There wasn't a drop left on anyone's plate!
7148	904	Amazing cake! Super yummy, and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again. I might make a 1/2 recipe since this cake was too huge for my gatherings. Make sure you have a proper angel food cake pan or it may not come out in one piece. I used a bundt cake pan with a pattern on it, and some of it got stuck in the patterned  top. Still, delicious!
7149	904	It does take a while to make but well worth it.  Great recipe!  Thanks!
7150	904	Moist and delicious. Well worth the time and effort.
7151	904	This cake provided a decadent outstandingly delicious presentation to my Easter table. Everyone raved about how moist and flavorful it was. Two ladies went home with the recipe. I omitted step 6. Thanks for a keeper Judy!
7152	905	Great punch, don't like the fizz with the pineapple juice though, much better taste the next day when the soda went flat.
7153	905	I served this punch at my daughters wedding shower yesterday. It was huge hit!!! I loved it! The reviews are correct, it's not overly sweet like so many punch recipes are! It was just perfect! Thank you for this great recipe!
7154	905	Love this recipe and the ease of ingredients.  I also like the way to change the calculator for servings.  I substituted the lemon-lime pop with Fresca
7155	905	I've made this for dozens of relatives and friends and it's always been a hit! I've been asked about it every time and despite wanting to claim it for my own, I can't help but give credit to the mysterious Aileen. Just a well-balanced drink with just the right amount of fruity sweet, lightly carbonated tang that holds up well, even when it's been mixed with ice for a few hours.
7156	905	Was looking for a punch that had a lot of juice in it for my daughter's birthday party. She absolutely loves juice and this was a big hit with her. We couldn't find apricot nectar so I used 46oz of V8 Peach Mango juice instead. We added a little sugar to make it less bitter but other than that we all loved this. The peach mango was perfect with this and I'd recommend it for a supplement if you can't find the apricot.
7157	905	Very good punch that was well received at my party by adults and kids alike.  Instead of apricot nectar, I pureed lite canned apricots (only apricots, water and sugar in the ingredients list) in the blender before the party.  I reserved the puree in the fridge until it was time to make the punch, which kept the preparation quick.  I also provided a bottle of vodka and a bottle of cherry amaretto on the side, and the adults enjoyed spiking their drinks.
7158	905	Scaled this down for 4 people and it Was a huge hit. Guests kept going back for more. Couldn't find apricot though so I had to use peach.
7159	905	I have made this punch for both my daughter's and daughter-in-law's showers.  Huge success.  Apricot nectar gives it a different, smooth flavor.  Mixes well with champagne.
7160	905	I thought the punch was on the bitter side.  I altered it by adding some orange juice, less apricot nectar, and using lemonade instead of the limeade concentrate.  This made for a smoother punch.
7161	906	This was awesome.  I used 2 legs and 2 thighs with the skin on and it was great.  And there was lots of sauce left over.    I can't wait to eat the leftovers.
7162	906	I like that this recipe didn't require excessive amounts of sugar and salt like so many apricot chicken dishes that call for russian dressing and onion soup. The sour cream provides a nice creamy texture and the mustard a pleasant zip. But while I liked the idea of a dish that required no extra cooking vessels, I decided to brown the chicken in a skillet before baking. That allowed me (1) to lock in more of the moisture and (2) to increase the time the chicken spent baking in the sauce, infusing more flavor. I really enjoyed the result and plan to make it again.
7163	906	I altered the recipe based on my family's tastes and the other reviews. I cut 4 chicken breast halves into cubes and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. I put 1 tbsp of olive oil and 2 tbsp of butter in a skillet and melted. I browned the chicken in the skillet along with 1/2 of a chopped white onion. Once the chicken was cooked I added in the sauce. I doubled the recipe for the sauce because my family loves sauce and we always eat rice with our chicken. I cooked the chicken an additional 10 minutes in the sauce then tasted. After tasting I felt like it needed something so I added a tbsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I served over rice with veggies. It was amazing!! I didn't think the sauce was too rich and the flavor was great! I won't be making it all the time because we have other recipes we like more but it's definitely something I will make again!
7164	906	WOW !!!  If my husband can say "This isn't bad honey", this is a 10 in my books.  Before I added the chicken to the casserole dish I did think about browning it in a pan then letting everything simmer, BUT, instead I added olive oil to the dish before I put the chicken in.  Put a healthy addition of sea salt, pepper and seasoning to the chicken and just pressed on it.  The flavor just POPPED !!!  I am adding this recipe to my "to do again list".  Thank You so much for putting this in all recipes !!!!!
7165	906	Great, easy recipe! Even though I followed the instructions to the letter I thought the finished product looked really bland so I drained a can of sugar-free apricots and sprinkled over the top then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. Also we served it with whole wheat couscous and drizzled some of the sauce over it, making for a healthy, tasty, healthy and attractive dinner. Will definitely make this again with the changes noted.
7166	906	I actually get requests for this dinner. It's so delicious! My husband gets excited when he sees me pull out the apricot preserves. I like to cut up the chicken into bite-size chunks, cook it on the stove, then add the sauce and let it simmer till warm. Then, I serve it over egg noodles. Yum!
7167	906	I did like this recipe... Easy and Delicious..
7168	906	my family liked it!
7169	906	Great flavor blend, really easy to prepare!   Followed recipe exactly-- Next time, might add extra preserves for more fruity taste.
7170	907	Very delicious recipe. Full disclosure I altered the recipe because I don't own an air fryer. I did brine the chops, then rubbed them and pan seared them and baked at 325° for 30 minutes. So tender and delicious ??
7171	908	let it cool down some before adding the booze or the alcohol will just burn off
7172	909	The biscotti were very good.  I had to add water and another egg to make it mold together like dough. I added chopped prunes instead of apricots. I didn’t have choc chips so skipped them.  Still very tasty. Would make again.
7173	909	The recipe seems a bit dry to me. However I am making it for the second time today, and I triple the espresso powder because I really couldn’t taste it in the first batch. I don’t know what to do about making the batter a little moist or maybe a little more butter I thought a quarter of a cup was kind of small amount for the 3 1/2 cups of flour. The biscotti itself is very tasty and satisfying and I have relatives that want me to send it for Christmas.
7174	909	Yum!  My first-time ever making Biscotti cookies.  Advise using the largest cookie sheet you have -- it makes a lot.  I'm freezing 2/3 of the cookies.  And head's up, biscotti dough needs some muscle for stirring.  Here are the changes I made because of things I didn't have on hand (no matter -- it's a forgiving recipe).  I omitted  apricots (didn't have); also I didn't have enough orange peel rind so I used lemon and lime rinds for zest.  I used all-purpose flour instead of pastry flour; and I only had freeze-dried instant coffee.  Apparently these are fool-proof cookies because with all my changes, they are perfect!  Didn't notice any coffee hint-flavor but probably because of my using freeze dried instant coffee instead of espresso instant.  Might be worth purchasing for the future.   And the crumbly bits make a perfect topping for yogurt (or ice cream or cereal).
7175	909	I've never made biscotti before so I didn't know what to expect when mixing the dough but 3-1/4 cups flour is way too much!  I could barely mix it in the bowl and it came out of the oven dry and crumbly after the minimum baking time.
7176	909	Made it exactly as written.  Found it to be somewhat bland, amazingly enough.  Not all that thrilled with it and likely will not make it again.
7177	909	This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review about anything, But felt it needful to share my  experience.  Followed this recipe exactly.  Espresso flavor is good.  Orange undetectable.  Product is extremely dry and very crumbly when cut.  Would strongly advise just following your own favorite biscotti recipe adding expresso flavoring.
7178	909	Turned out great though doubling the batch gave my mixer a tough time. Omitted nuts due to allergies used mini chips and some extra cranberries
7179	909	I doubled the espresso as suggested, but still don't really taste it. That being said these are very good. I also left out the apricots and chocolate chips and dipped in chocolate instead. The dough is pretty stiff and difficult to mix all the goodies into so I just dumped it on the counter and kneaded them in. Also, I wish I would have flattened the logs even more so they would be long thin slices. I thought I went to about an inch, but I was a little over and it does rise.
7208	267	I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   The family was asking for more, but I did not make enough.   Especially good during this hot season.  This dish will definitely be in the family meals rotation in the future.
7209	267	You select your favorite fruits. the flavor is really brought together by the syrup. I used watermelon, pineapple, strawberries, and blackberries. I mixed residual watermelon juice  with the syrup and it gave a wonderful flavor. Super refreshing. It was a hit at the dinner party.
7180	909	I thought this was a good recipe. I used it in some mailed cookie boxes for Christmas. I like how there is so much going on flavor wise. The orange zest flavor is pretty dominant and I liked that. The colors arent so vibrant like on the marichino cherry ones. I actually labeled what was in them, on the gift packages, because its hard to tell. Only change I made was halving the fruit and chopping it up. I also just chopped whole almonds. For the coffee I used starbucks instant Christmas blend grind. Lastly, I used cake flour and salted butter. The 2" width, on the shaping, seemed small. I went with approximately 2.5." I suggest that, because they dont puff up much larger after the first bake. They still are a smaller biscotti. I had no issues with cutting them which was nice. I hope the food gift is liked.
7181	910	I really liked these and so did my guests!I read past reviews for recipe.  Could they have used the wrong product? Evaporated milk isn’t the same as sweetened condensed milk!
7182	910	Delicious. BUT! These are a sticky, gooey mess that's impossible to roll into balls if the recipe is followed. I wish I had read the reviews, but I printed the recipe years ago and was working from it. Entirely too much condensed milk! I had to double the coconut, and still had to refrigerate before making into very soft balls. I am disappointed in this recipe for these reasons, but the flavor is great. I added 1/4 tsp almond extract to enhance the apricot flavor. This is not enough liquid to make these as gooey as they are. Just add 1/2 the amount of condensed milk then add the rest only as needed.
7183	910	Very yummy and easy! I chopped apricots,  california figs, and sliced almonds in a blender, and mixed it all with some of the coconut and just enough condensed milk to make it stick. Then I rolled it in chopped almonds/coconut for a slightly crunchy exterior - they're super sweet so I didn't add any sugar. And they definitely taste better cold :)
7184	910	Love all the thing separately, but apparently not together.  Sorry!
7185	910	I love these! I took them to work & everyone asked for the recipe.
7186	910	I served these at a holiday party at my home and guests were telling me that they don't even like apricot..but LOVED these!
7187	910	So easy and a welcomed addition to my annual array of Christmas goodies!  I made the recipe exactly as shown, but added some graham cracker crumbs (about 1/4 cup) to the mixture to make it a bit more workable, and I have to say it was delicious cut the sweetness a bit.  I rolled them very small (1/3 inch)and then rolled half in coconut, and the other half in graham cracker crumbs to add a bit of variety.
7188	910	These were delicious!! i was a bit unsure about the amount of condensed milk, so just added a bit at a time until the mixture seemed right - i'm so glad i didn't pour the whole can in!!
7189	910	Good buy almost cloyingly sweet.
7190	911	I haven’t tasted the jam yet, and this may be my fault for misinterpreting the recipe,  but I prefer to cook by weight whenever weight is indicated so I used 4lbs of prepared nectarines (vs. 4lbs whole) as opposed to the 4.5 cups mentioned in the instructions. My Jam did not set. Now I’m in a “jam”! I will need to reprocess - wish me luck!
7191	911	This is a quick and easy receiepe. The only change I made was to have 2 cups of sugar. It was plenty sweet. The almond is a nice touch
7192	911	Hard to find a recipe for Nectarine jam. Setting up nicely, and used cinnamon. Ez to follow despite part of recipe being wiped out by invasive ads. Always like your recipes!
7193	912	With the exception of slicing unpeeled nectarines and adding a few blueberries and a bit more spice to the mix, I made this as written and it turned out to be more like fruit soup than a pie.  It came out of the oven bubbling and I let it sit until it was completely cool but the inside was all liquid and the nectarines were still uncooked.  I put it back in the oven at 300 for an hour hoping it would come out less soupy which seemed to slightly.  The flavor was very good so I'd like to try it again but, as written, something is off a bit.  Maybe cook it longer at a lower temp?
7194	912	Awesome
7195	912	Delicious and easy!
7196	912	Tasty but runny.  My husband picked up nectarines instead of peaches so I decide to make this pie.  I followed the recipe but would do a few things different.  The pie shell should be pre baked to keep it from being soggy.  The mixture needs to be thickened, maybe some arrowroot would keep it from being so runny.  All in all it tasted quite good.
7197	912	I made this pie following the recommendations if several users - adding extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla as the flavors/spices (no almond flavoring).  I also added the crumb topping.  It turned out perfectly and not too runny, even though my nectarines were quote juicy.  Yum!
7198	912	I followed some of the other suggestions, and increased the cinnamon, quartered the nectarines with the peels on, and added a crumb topping. This wasn't my favorite recipe - the flavor was still a bit bland, which probably had to do with the quality of the fruit. If I make again, I'd try adding nutmeg and ginger, and slice the nectarines into thinner slices than quartered.
7199	912	This was absolutely wonderful! So tasty! It tasted almost like french toast. I am sharing this recipe with everyone I know!
7200	912	I was so excited to find this recipe. I am an accomplished baker and chef. Very disappointed in the out come. The filling was quite runny. Next time I make it I will throw in a couple of eggs and make it a custard and bake as such.
7201	912	I melted  a little butter and sugar to a glaze and spread it on the pie crust then added a little brown sugar and extra cream to the recipe and used vanilla instead of almond extract
7202	267	I liked the simplicity in making it. Just cut up the my favorite fruit that I had in the refrigerator. I used the suggested amount of each fruit. I think the honey and lemon juice topped it off.
7203	267	Didn’t have all of the fruits, so substituted several things.  I did have the watermelon, blackberries, strawberries.  What makes this work is the dressing and the mint.  It was wonderful.  If you don’t have all of the fruits, no worries - put what you have in there.  Keep the dressing and mint the same.  I loved it and will definitely make again.
7204	267	The mint was nice for a change from the traditional fruit salad.  Not a replacement of the traditional recipe but adds a tasty option.
7205	267	A great, colorful fruit salad.  I used Honeydew instead of Watermelon.  I left out the peaches since the white peaches i bought we too hard.  I added 2 Kiwi and used a full lemon's zest.  Finally I added a champagne mango.  The whole salad was enjoyed at a brunch today with 13 people.  Will do this again!
7206	267	Oh no! This was perfect ! My family loved it. Definitely will make it more often & for other occasions.
7207	267	I changed up the fruit (used watermelon, blueberries, honeydew melon, strawberries and white peaches), made the dressing as written using mint from our garden, and this was a hit at dinner! Delicious
7210	267	I didn't use the same combination of fruits. I had watermellow, strawberries, blueberries and pineapple. It was fine, we took it to a summer block party and it vanished. Everyone liked the honey lemon and mint dressing.
7211	914	This was a hit at our party with chips. We also substituted the nectarine with mango and used it as a side for our salmon.
7212	914	So flavourful, fresh & delicious. Thank you, as always, Chef John!
7213	914	Delicious on salmon, chicken and pork! The nectarine salsa got rave reviews from everyone who tried it!
7214	914	Great, fresh addition to fish, chicken or as a change up with tortilla chips. Added a mango and peach for more flavor, touch of honey (tsp.), half the oil and extra jalapeno for a nice zing. Cayenne pepper is a must as well.  Will make again!
7215	914	I added a plumcot to it and it was absolutely delicious .will definitely make this alot more!
7216	914	Excellent salsa very tasty.  This paired with the Moist Pork Chop recipe was the best.
7217	914	Rave reviews from guests at a recent party. Only problem we had? Everyone overloaded their scoop chips and we ran out of salsa
7218	914	We have tons of peppers this year. I used one of every color. Excellent presentation. My Father in Law wants me to make a ton and can it. I don't know how, yet. I want to keep the texture and the super fresh taste.
7219	914	I used pineapple instead of nectarines. Yummy.
7220	915	tastes great grilled
7221	915	What a delightful, light ending to a meal! I served the nectarine with vanilla Greek yogurt, and it was delicious!
7222	916	The Lemon yogurt is unbelievable with the fresh fruit-celery.
7223	916	I didn't really like this fruit salad.  It was very bland.
7224	916	I loved it! Brilliant recipe! I would make it again and again.
7225	916	I adore this! My go to fruit salad that everyone thinks is fancy. Guess again! Now when I couldn’t get a nectarine, I threw in blueberries and sliced strawberries. Judge on color for the completed salad.. and use really good yogurt..
7226	916	I’ve made three times now. So easy AND delicious. I use Cuties mandarins instead of nectarines. Use full-fat lemon or lime yogurt so it’s not runny. Big hit.
7227	916	Instead of regular yogurt, I used Silk yogurt alternative (family member can't have dairy). Even added a little wheat germ and a little honey.
7228	916	This is a hit at potlucks!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 key lime and 1 vanilla yogurt, instead of vanilla.  Also subbed 1 cup halved red grapes instead of celery and a 15 oz can of mandarin oranges instead of nectarines.  Also toasted the nuts.  Everyone loved it!
7229	916	This is good if you eat it right away, but I had it in the fridge for 2 hours and by the time we ate it the yogurt was all watery.
7230	916	I added a can of pineapple chunks & it was delicious.
7231	917	The raspberry liqueur is subtle in both the dressing and the whipped topping.  I would think some raspberry extract would work well in this if you don't have the Chambord.  Didn't have any raspberries, so I substituted some green grapes, and I literally forgot the almonds (think they'd be a nice addition).  This was a great dessert on a smokin' hot  Florida day!  The summer fruits are starting to come in season, so bring on the fruit salads!!
7232	918	Loved this!!  I used peaches since I had some already and sautéed them because I can't eat raw stone fruit. I omitted the red onion because, well, yuck! and I added chicken breast marinated in a black pepper marinade.(my husband has to have a real protein if the salad is the meal)  It was outstanding!  It took me awhile to find the cheese but I eventually found it at Safeway, believe it or not.  Not even Whole Foods had it.  This will become a summer salad staple.
7233	918	We really enjoyed this salad. The dressing was very refreshing and we loved the combination of nectarines and spinach. I am new to cooking with haloumi and the detailed cooking directions in this recipe really helpful. I didn’t make any changes.
7234	918	I love this recipe. Nectarines can be hard to cut when very ripe. Cube the fruit around the pit is a good strategy. I couldn't find Haloumi at my local market so I used Bread Cheese, which has a similar consistency and heats just as well on the grill.
7235	918	The recipe in the magazine is slightly different than the one online.  The salad was very good. I also added some fried Tofu to up the protein since I was making it for dinner.  The honey mustard vinaigrette seemed a little strange on it.  I might try a light poppy seed dressing on it the next time.  I might also try experimenting with some different fruits, maybe some berries.
7236	919	This was awesome! The flavors blended really nice. The salsa was yummy. I substituted peaches for the nectarines and it was fantastic! Really liked that salsa!
7237	919	My son and I loved it!  I cooked the pork chops on an indoor grill and they were tender and juicy.  The salsa is great and will be used for many other meats also.  We will make it again!!!
7238	919	When the family says “YUMM!” It’s a hit!
7239	919	I used a peach as well as nectarines.
7240	919	Had to use peaches instead of nectarines and pan fry the pork instead of grilling. Also I used harissa paste instead of red pepper flakes and chili powder, which I will do again, it added a great flavor dynamic. Regardless, it was delicious! I think it would be great with just about any meat or fish. Can’t wait to make it again with nectarines and I’ll add extra cilantro. To pan fry, I brushed on grape seed oil (both sides), salt & peppered and coated lightly with blend of cumin, coriander, onion powder & garlic powder, coated bottom of cast iron pan with grape seed oil and fried on med-high for about 4 mins on each side. Perfectly tender and great color.
7241	919	Beautiful and easy dish, but I was disappointed with the lack of flavor in the pork itself. I followed the recipe exactly, and I really wish I would have doubled the rub as some others mentioned. The salsa was delicious, however, and is the only reason I may try this one again.
7242	919	I loved this salsa. I used more onion because I wanted more of the crunchy texture, and I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. To tone down the heat, I omitted the black pepper and substituted Trader Joe's Chile Lime Seasoning Blend for the chili powder. The reason I toned down the heat is because I served it over Chipotle Crusted Pork Tenderloin from All Recipes, which has a good kick (even though I reduce the 3 Tbsp Chipotle Chile Powder to 1 Tbsp). I think this salsa would be great over pork, chicken, fish, pretty much anything. Very fresh tasting!
7243	919	It was a fairly quick and easy recipe. Tastes  really good.
7244	919	I used peaches - was delicious!
7245	920	yes I will make it again..I added peachess
7246	920	Loved it.  Will make again and again even if not exact to the recipe, you can put what you have on hand in a pitcher and enjoy! Very easy.
7247	920	I have tried other flavored waters before most of them usually included mint, grapefruit, orange, cucumber, etc., I really enjoyed how beautiful this flavored water was, and it was quite refreshing!
7248	920	Really refreshing and healthy!!!...It makes me think of summer!!!
7249	921	Excellent basic recipe. We have a peach tree so I used all peaches, no nectarines. Like some of the others, I used a 9 x 13 pan and used about 1.5x  the ingredients. I also used 1/2 cup of rolled oats and less flour and added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Loved the texture and taste.  I may add more pecans next time.
7250	921	I didn't have nectarines but did have a ton of peaches so I just used those. I did one and a half times the recipe to put it in a 9x13. Outside of that I left it just as it was and it turned out fantastic. My family loves it and using 9 cups of peaches was awesome!
7251	921	Skip Dinner.  Seriously.
7252	921	It smells awesome.  Peeling and coring the fruits took me the most time to do. Everything else was simple.
7253	922	Easy!
7254	922	This was really a different and fun way to have a healthy dessert.  I didn't use as much sugar as called for and I did dust with a little cinnamon.  I used greek yogurt so it would hod up and not be so runny.
7255	922	Simply and straight forward and down right delicious. I do think vanilla yogurt would have paired nicely with the nectarine without overpowering and I plan to try that next time.
7256	923	Fantastic recipe - easy, nutritious and tasty.  Definitely will be making it again.
7257	923	Christian Bordres
7258	924	I used a box yellow cake mix and mixed it as the box directed.  Used a 9 by 13 inch pan sprayed with pam.  peeled and cut up 4 nectarines and used on the bottom of the pan with the 3 tbsp butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Cooked for 28 minutes.  It turned out delicious.  I didn't have the issues with the batter being too thick or too dry.  Sorry my picture wouldn't upload.
7259	924	Batter too cookie like. Used 11 tablespoons of crisco and 1 cup of heavy/Whipping cream to the cake part of the recipe. Came out perfect.  Can also use monkfruit/ erythrytol for the sweetener measure for measure for sweetner.
7260	924	The cake portion of this recipe was dry.  Won't make it again.
7261	924	Pretty good over all. A little bit dry though.
7262	924	There is no doubt -- it IS delicious!  The dough is very thick and must be spooned on top of the fruit mixture but -- my dough did not spread as it baked and so it was more like a cobbler than a cake -- it would have come completely apart if I had tried to flip it over -- so I just served it directly out of the pan as a cobbler.  Everyone loved it with vanilla ice cream over top.  I will make it again calling it what I think it more resembles!
7263	924	The  cake  batter is missing a liquid.  Maybe milk?  My cake batter came out like cookie dough.  I plopped it on the nectarine brown sugar butter  layer and baked it.    This  cakes fell on it's face.    I was disappointed.  It's  not sweet.
7264	924	I only changed the pan and added extra fruit!  Bundt pan was beautiful! Will taste great with vanilla ice cream!
7265	924	I made this without tweaking it and it was wonderful!!! My Great-Nephew's loved it and they are both very picky!
7266	924	I made this without tweaking it and it was wonderful!!! My Great-Nephew's loved it and they are both very picky!
7267	925	I followed recipe precisely and was disappointed. No tang. I think what was missing ,as a I had a dud red onion. Just the right amount of balsamic, Had no onion flavor. Will try again with another red onion, hopefully sharper..
7268	925	This is really awesome!  I left out the cilantro cuz we don't like it, but we didn't miss it!  I did not cook it, left it fresh. Really good with the balsamic vinegar, more like a relish, but my son added hot taco sauce to his when we put it on steak tacos with freshly fried corn shells, and it was just SO good!  I think it would be good with any type of meat, grilled food, fish, Mexican, whatever!  Now I know what to do with those nectarines that aren't ripe and sweet when I bring them home from the store...
7269	925	I followed the directions exactly but my finished product looks nothing like the photo.  How do you tell if your nectarines are lightly browned when they are covered in dark brown vinegar? This salsa was better before I cooked it.  If I make this again I will cut way down on the balsamic vinegar.  It was still tasty.
7270	925	Absolutely FANTASTIC! Honestly, I liked it enough that I ate it straight up with a spoon. The tang of the balsamic with the sweet of the fruit plus the sharp onoins really is an incredible mix!
7271	925	I doubled the recipe  for all ingredients except balsamic vinegar. I used a pear infused balsamic, fresh cilantro and dried cranberries after it cooled. The salt and pepper really balanced the sweetness of the nectarines. I served it with poached salmon. Delish!
7272	925	Love this! I never use the sugar or cilantro and would agree that about 1/2 of the balsamic is all that's needed. Also great over fish using other fruit such as apples!
7273	925	Looking over this recipe, the amount of balsamic vinegar didn't make sense. So I cut the amount in half--and it was STILL too much vinegar...plus, it lacked complexity--the cilantro and balsamic don't play well together, ime, and it was missing some heat. (Maybe some pepper flakes?) It wasn't awful, but wouldn't make this again.
7274	925	I liked this quite a bit, but my boyfriend wasn't a big fan.  We served it over rice as an accompaniment to the Oaxacan Tacos you can find on this site.  The vinegar taste is a little strong, I think.  Since we have some left over, though, it might be good on top of bruschetta.
7275	926	This is such an odd combination of flavors, but it is wonderful.  Thanks!
7276	926	These flavors work really well.  Only changes from recipe were to sub 1t mango juice with a shake of hot sauce, cut back to just a shake of salt, and to bake our large chicken breasts for an hour. Chicken came out juice with nice texture and great flavor.
7277	926	The only reason I gave this recipe 1 star is because they don't allow you to give it none.  There are so many things wrong with this recipe, i'm not even going to bother to give suggestions to fix it...the breadcrumbs end up like oatmeal, the flavors just don't work together, the only good thing about this recipe was the baked nectarines - just make yourself a cobbler w/that beautiful fruit!  We ended up literally scraping everything off of the chicken and eating it that way just to keep from having to go out.
7297	931	I made Sticky NECTARINE Chicken instead. I have some very ripe nectarines that I pitted and boiled in enough water to cover them. I added some non-sugar sugar. Puréed the nectarines and skin with an immersion blender. Then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. We are not folks who like it really hot so I halved the pepper sauce. It was still more heat than we wanted. I added some more nectarine juice which helped.
7278	926	I made this recipe and all I tasted on the chicken was tomato, which is amazing since it has the kitchen sink.  I think the grapefruit juice brought out the acid in the marinara and just made it taste like licking tomato sauce.  The thing that made it better was taking a bit with the nectarine, but there were not enough of them to really eat it with the chicken.  Neither my husband or I could finish it.  (And my husband will eat anything since his mom is one of the worst cooks out there!) :)
7279	926	Wonderful mix of flavors
7280	926	Yummy Chicken
7281	926	VERY GOOD  This is a great summer recipe!  Will definatly make again!
7282	926	Very good! Followed the recipe pretty closely although it is hard to find hot mango sauce so we used hot Thai hot chili sauce instead. The only thing I suggest is less marinara sauce. It added an interesting taste but was over powering.
7283	926	So moist!  I actually marinated the chicken in a duck sauce (no marinara, so I subbed more duck) and pineapple (no grapefruit either!) juice mixture, then baked the entire thing without using the bread crumbs due to other commenters' posts about mushiness.  I mixed the spices and sprinkled them on top, then used mango (no nectarines!) around the sides.  Definitely moist and scrumptious!  Only thing I'll change is to halve the pepper next time, but otherwise, totally FIVE STARS!  Made with a steamed cauliflower/broccoli mix and some cheesy broccoli rice for something bland-ish to go with the spicy chicken.  Amazing!
7284	927	I made this for my lunch with a peach instead of a nectarine. It was so good that I ate both servings! I’m already looking forward to lunch tomorrow!
7285	928	Wow! I have made pies for years so when I read through this one and saw the jiffy corn mix poured into the bottom I was skeptical as I’d never made a pie that way. It made a lovely base for the fruit, so thumbs up for that step. I needed to use up some apples and nectarines; came across this by doing a search with those ingredients. So glad I did!! I used a Pillsbury pie crust and had to make my own jiffy corn mix(found it online). Followed the recipe as written. The only hiccup I had was the baking of the lower crust with the muffin mix for 5 to 8 minutes. Go for the 5, I over baked it a little and it wouldn’t press into the top crust so next time I’ll lessen that a little but it didn’t affect the taste or appearance of the pie. I also loved the flavor that the apple peels gave to the sugar mixture that was poured over the fruit. We did not find it to be too sweet. I used my food processor to slice the apples and nectarines thin, that’s the way we like our apples in pies Served with vanilla ice cream. I had to go back for a second little piece it was so good! Five stars!
7286	928	Very delicious ??. Next time I will cut back the sugar a bit.
7287	929	We had picked up 5lbs of Nectarines and we needed to use them quickly. This recipe is surprisingly great. I thought the buttermilk would make it taste sour, however, the sweetness of the fruit with buttermilk made this taste outstanding.  I use an extra nectarine and some extra ice and this was something I will make next summer as well
7288	929	I tried this because my daughter had her wisdom teeth removed and needed a smoothie, I had all of the ingredients so I decided to try this one. I always make my own "buttermilk" by using regular milk and lemon juice (1-1 1/2 tsp lemon juice then fill to the 1 C line) so that was the only slight change I made. This prevented the overly strong buttermilk flavor many people observed. I used white nectarines that I had allowed to ripen until soft, then had them refrigerated...perfection.
7289	929	Used a peach and nectarine plus ice. Really tasty. Will make again.
7290	929	Hubs walked into the kitchen as I was making this - uh-oh!  The buttermilk carton was on the counter, so I quickly hid it under the sink before he could see it. I knew if he knew there was buttermilk in it, this smoothie would be doomed. I watched as he quickly drank the first glassful and I asked him to comment while I poured him a refill (this was about 30 seconds later).  He said it was "peachy," (of course he MEANT "nectarine-y"), and that there was "something odd about it - but in a good way." Only after he finished the last of this 2-serving recipe did I reveal there was buttermilk in the drink, to which he quickly scrunched up his nose. And then he rated it four stars.  I never saw him drink a smoothie that fast. I made this exactly as the submitter directed and threw a few ice cubes into the blender as well.  Hubs said he appreciated that this wasn't so cold that it gave him an ice cream headache.  Maybe that's why it went down in a New York Minute.
7291	929	Hmm, well, this just did not go over well with me.  About the only reason I could give is that it was "too much."  I did peel and freeze the nectarines first, because I already knew it would be almost warm if I didn't.  So if you happen to like this, I definitely would suggest the freezing, and even half-freezing the buttermilk.
7292	929	Very good, and good for you! I did find the buttermilk flavor coming through a tad strong, so I think I'll cut back on that next time and supplement with regular milk or, as other reviewers tried, with orange juice. The nectarine flavor is great and its just so simple to make! Thanks for sharing your recipe!
7293	929	I would give it five stars, but I didn't think that was fair considering that I changed the recipe some. I took CC's advice and chopped the nectarine up, froze it and then used half OJ and half buttermilk. The buttermilk would have been overpowering if I had used the full cup. (and I love buttermilk!) So the recipe, as is, would be good, but not something I make again. With those changes, it is now my all-time favorite smoothie!
7294	929	love buttermilk and this is great - no sugar needed. Does need to be well chilled.  Other fruit can be used, but prefer nectarines.   Thanks.....
7295	929	I do like buttermilk in a smoothie, but it was too dominant here, and though I used sweet ripe nectarines, their flavor did not come through as I was expecting. Because the recipe doesn't use frozen fruit or ice, it was warm, which was not appealing. I added a frozen banana after the fact which helped make it slightly icy and more refreshing. Ice cubes would dilute the flavor even more. I might make this again if I have buttermilk to use up, but I would chop up the nectarines ahead of time and toss them in the freezer overnight, cut the buttermilk in half and make up the difference with orange juice.
7296	930	This was really good!!! I found it a little on the bland side as written, but I added a sprinkle of salt and that made a world of difference. I also ended up adding a drizzle of white balsamic, as suggested in the Cook's Notes.  This is best eaten right away, as the goat cheese ends up "melting" into the salad and turning the liquid whitish. Definitely doesn't affect the flavor though! I will be making this again!  Also note that this makes way more than 4 side servings.
7298	932	I always feel bad rating things that I changed, but since there was only one rating I thought I would give my two cents.
7349	942	What a delicious German chocolate frosting. I added two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste and it made it so creamy and yummy.
7299	932	The crumble topping is amazing and I would give five stars to the crumble alone!  The filling is where I had some problems.   The raspberries and nectarines are slightly tart, so, only using 2 tbsp. of sugar left for a more tart filling that I would have preferred.  There is also no thickener in the filling other than the natural pectin in the fruit.  The filling was very runny.  I would have preferred a thicker sauce with the fruit. 7/7/18 My review above was based on when we ate the dessert the same day we made it. Today I upped it from 3 to 4 stars.  The flavors melded together and wasn’t nearly as tart as it was yesterday.  I do still think the sauce is a little thin for us and I would add a little thickner.
7300	933	These bars were a fantastic way to use some very ripe nectarines I had. The bars are really quite easy to make, and taste great. I will give a warning on the bake times though: my crust began to brown in just 20 minutes, and the filling was already set after 15 minutes of baking. If I had baked the filling the 30 minutes as stated, the bars would've been way overdone--and maybe burnt. So just keep a close watch on baking times. Also, for the crust, I used unsalted butter, so I added 1/3 tsp of salt to dough, plus 1 tsp vanilla extract for flavor. I added the flour to the butter/sugar mixture just until it formed crumbs (only needed 1 2/3 cups flour). For the filling, I only used a 1/2 cup sugar since my nectarines were super super ripe, and took the submitter's advice to add some lemon juice to it (only 1 tbsp). I also lined my baking pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides; thus making it super easy to get the bars out of the pan. Overall, we really enjoyed these bars, and I will make them again--and maybe try them with other fruit as well. Thank you for the recipe.
7301	934	I suggest reducing the white wine vinegar otherwise it’s too bitey.  It overwhelms all the other wonderful flavors.  Also, my nectarines seemed under ripe. They were very tough and lacked sweetness. I will definitely make this again regularly, but will use peaches instead.
7302	935	amazingly delicious!  my grandfather's new favorite.  very easily made, i cheated and used frozen pie shells, but was delicious!
7303	935	My only additional comment would be to make the dough first and let it rest in the refrigerator for an hour. That let's the dough become more pliable, it keeps it from snapping back and makes it easier to handle.
7304	935	I used fresh sour cherries, plums and apricots. Everyone looooved it!!!
7305	935	What a pie! Everything about it works - the flavors of the fruits together with a tiny bit of cinnamon. Some people might want it sweeter - but if you want a pie that puts wonderful fruit flavors first make this as is. If I were to make any changes, I might add 2 Tbsp of cornstarch to the fruit, because it was a little on the liquidy side. I will make this again, and I will make it again often. This is a new favorite - thanks!
7306	935	Very good recipe, I too added more cornstarch to allow for the extra juicy fruit. I have used variations of this recipe with any of our orchard fruit, including huckleberries which pair up nicely with apricots or peaches
7307	935	I used my mom's crust recipe and a crumb topping, but the fruit flavor was terrific.  I think I will call the pie by a different name, though, since "Drupey" sounds so unappealing.
7308	935	This recipe is a great base. For the fruit I used fresh nectarines and fresh blueberries. For the crust I used already made crust. I used another review and doubled the cornstarch. Then as the topping I combined 1 cup oats, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 6 T. flour, 1/2 cup butter in a bowl and blended the ingredients with my fingers until it was crumbly. I baked it as directed and my husband and I were in hog heaven!! It reminded me of the crisp desserts you find at Claim Jumper. Mmmmm! Thank you for the great recipe.
7309	935	This was good, I didn't have any cherries on me so added extra apricot.  My only problem was even though I strained the fruit, when they cooked they became quite juicy, so I think a little more flour/cornstarch is needed in the fruit mix, but apart from that this was great.
7310	936	Delicious flavor, but very very sweet to me.  Since I don't have much of a sweet tooth,  I would probably reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar on top to about 1 tablespoon and use a little less jelly next time.  Amazingly enough, the white pepper really did set off the sweetness of the fruit without being easily identifiable as pepper.   Mine turned out a tad bit too soupy, but I wouldn't fault the recipe for that. The fruit I used was at peak season and fairly juicy, so next time I'll compensate with a bit more cornstarch.  Aside from the time it took to slice the fruit, this was quick to put together and bake.
7311	936	I made this for a good friend's birthday instead of the traditional birthday cake and it turned out just beautiful!  And she loved it!
7312	937	I love how fresh this is for summer.  The coconut gives it the perfect amount of sweetness.
7313	937	Wow! Nothing screams summer like a delicious fruit salad. This is definitely bursting with vibrant colors and flavors! I toasted my cococut and topped with a dollop of fat free greek vanilla vs. non-dairy whipped topping. Very nice presentation and oh so refreshing!
7314	937	Very yummy. I doubled the whipped topping, only because we REALLY like whipped topping. I also toasted my coconut and sprinkled it over each bowl of salad. We loved this. Quite refreshing.
7315	937	Thank you for posting this recipe.  It was the inspiration I needed to make my fruit salad.  It did have a little too much cinnamon for my taste, but that is easily fixed next time - just taste as you go.
7316	937	i love the addition of the coconut! great!!
7317	937	I am making this salad for the second time in one week.  It is SO delicious that I am taking it to a Birthday Breakfast this morning.  Try this recipe.  You'll be glad you did.
7318	938	So mine didn’t come out as expected but it was good. It’s been outrageously hot so the topping turned into more of a mushy texture even when browned, and the flavor of the topping was too strong. I think I’d definitely do a different kind of topping and add the cinnamon and ginger to the fruit which I’ll precook on the stove to make a more cohesive filling. The flavors are amazing, I think next time I’ll try it with plums, more raspberries, cherries, and maybe blackberries or another tart fruit. I also sprinkled the fruit with a little cornstarch to thicken the juices into a sauce, which I definitely recommend if you don’t want to wait an extra 30 min of cooking for it to thicken on its own.
7319	938	A great recipe! I change up the fruits to whatever I have on hand. Peaches, nectarines, blackberries! So good. Easy!
7320	938	The store didn't have plums so I used peaches and raspberries. It was pretty good although the peach did stand out a tad. Crust was awesome.
7321	938	Yum
7347	942	I made it and it turned out fabulous!! Tastes so much better then the store bought frosting! Spreads nicely and tastes GREAT! Highly recommended!
7348	942	delicious
7611	972	The chocolate icing is so unnecessarily sweet. Ridiculously so.  Almost uneatable.
7322	938	This has great fruit flavor, but the topping was too much, in my opinion. A good portion of it sank and mixed into the fruit juices, which gave everything a weird texture. I think halving the amount of topping might help that part. I also had to bake mine at least an extra 25-30 minutes to get the fruit cooked down and not be soupy, and to get the top browned. Part of that was my fault, as I realized too late that I used a Pyrex baking dish, which is not broiler safe. So make sure you use a broiler safe pan so you can properly brown the topping. I also felt it could use less sugar, and more raspberries, but that's personal preference.  I would make again, as I really enjoy the plum/nectarine/raspberry flavor combination, but I would definitely make a few adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!
7323	938	I had never made a cobbler before and was looking for something universally appealing to make good use of our abundance of garden fruit... I used strawberries, peaches and pluots.  The neighborhood and my family want MORE.  Making it again now.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!
7324	938	Liked it a lot. I used nectarines, strawberries, and black berries and grated one fresh ginger (but less of it). I may have put too much butter in the flour mixture but it still turned out. This is a keeper for me.
7325	938	Fantastic!
7326	938	Delicious! I added nutmeg & used turbinado sugar instead of the other sugars.
7327	940	Instead of graham crackers, I crushed up some leftover snickerdoodles with some Club crackers so these wouldn't be so sweet.  Worked really well.  And like most, mixed the butter in with the crumbs and lined the pan.  Didn't have any butterscotch chips, so used more chocolate chips and added some real peanut butter not chips) to the SC milk.  Yum!!  This also helped to cut the sweetness.  Thanks for the recipe.
7328	940	Everyone loved this dessert! I used peanut butter chips to replace the butterscotch and warmed the condensed milk in warm water before pouring it on top of the coconut. Next time I'm going to use some spicy almonds to contrast all the sweet.
7329	940	This is a great recipe, I use salted peanuts though because the addition of the little bit of salt is delicious in this dessert. Also I have made it for years and I prefer the condensed milk poured over the crust then the toppings pressed into it, they come out chewier like this, just refrigerate before cutting.
7330	940	I have made these cookies for years and saw this recipe was layered differently so I decided to see if it made a difference. Sorry I did because they didn’t bake the same. When the condensed milk goes on top of the coconut it forms a better top layer. The way this is under the coconut it didn’t bake right and I ended up having to put it back in the oven after they cooled. They were so gooey I couldn’t cut them and they were falling apart. Didn’t think it would make such a difference.
7331	940	😋 they Smell Delicious!! I can't wait to try, I made the Glutenfree version 😋
7332	940	I make these with coconut milk Bc my family is lactose intolerant   I also add the Kraft carmel balls & dark choco chips instead of milk choco & pecans instead of walnuts…Family fav. Sometimes I substitute coffee flavored chips or white choco ones  holidays use red & green…crushed peppermint .. such a fun recipe and super easy to take to work as a special treat to share w co-workers…
7333	940	add 1/4 tsp of lemon jiuce
7334	940	LOVE IT...LOVE IT...LOVE IT.  This will be my new favorite, especially for a church-covered dish and/or Christmas morning treat.  Tried it three ways: as presented, then another with just chocolate chips and nuts, and another with choc chips, butterscotch chips, and nuts.  And, one with walnuts and another with pecans.  Delicious.  Could eat the whole plate, but better not.
7335	940	One of my favorite bars, which I have been making for over 50 years. I make exactly as written, except I brown my butter before adding to the graham crackers. Brown butter and graham crackers compliment each other perfectly. Yummy recipe!
7336	941	Omg best ever!!!!
7337	941	It was delicious! The only change I made was to double the chocolate topping (I also used semi-sweet mini chips). It was wonderful!
7338	941	Super easy to follow recipe. I used 9x9" pan and omitted almonds from the bottom layer. After pressing in graham cracker crust I added 1/2 cup quartered pecans. I used custard powder from flan pudding box and spread it on top, then cooled it. For the chocolate top I used 16 Hershey's hot cocoa kisses. Melted them as directed and poured on top of custard. Outrageously delicious! Thanks!
7339	941	Followed the recipe as written - using Bird's Custard powder and lined the 8x8 pan with parchment - and they turned out amazing. I used a paring knife to score the chocolate before it was completely hard, and then they were super easy to cut neatly afterwords. My first thought was why have I assumed these were difficult to make? A definite keeper!
7340	941	I love these, but I like something with a stronger cocoa punch, so...I used special dark cocoa power and added 1/2 tbsp of espresso powder to the crust layer.I also made a ganache with bitter sweet chocolate for the top layer. 4-5oz is plenty for this layer if using a 8x8 or 9x9 inch square pan for either topping method.
7341	941	This was surprisingly easy to make! I followed the recipe using some suggestions found in the comments. One thing I tried differently was replace the graham crackers with more nuts. I love the extra crunch it gives! This replacement made the dish gluten free, so guests with gluten allergies can enjoy them guilt free too!
7342	941	Super easy to follow!  My husband can't have dairy so I replaced the custard powder with the cornstarch method and used full-fat coconut milk in place of the cream.Only minor problem I had was spreading the top layer of chocolate on top.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and dairy-free butter.  Definitely wasn't as liquidy as it was in the video.  It started slightly melting the middle layer.  Did anyone else have this issue or did I just get the measurements all wrong with my substitutions for the chocolate?
7343	941	I've made this recipe several times, best nanaimo bars ever. I follow the tpis in the comments, omit the almond, & double the chocolate top. If you want to make it gluten free, crushed Schär Honeygrams are a great substitute for graham cracker crumbs.
7344	941	These were too sweet for me. Also, after making the middle layer, I thought it would have tasted better to just use vanilla rather than vanilla pudding. I didn't think the vanilla pudding added enough flavor to make a difference. The color was pretty though. And of course custard powder may make a greater impact in flavor than the pudding did. I won't make these again.
7345	942	Easy to make and the taste is exquisite.
7346	942	This recipe is exceptional! I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  I stirred it on stove until thickened and stirring left small indents from my whisk passing through, then off stove and added pecans and coconut.  Next time I am going to toast nuts and coconut as some other bakers suggested as I do believe that will enhance it and make it a 5 star.
7612	972	LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM!
7350	942	This frosting is amazing! Just like my mom used to make for me. She doubled the recipe and I will too so that there is plenty of frosting for a double layer cake inside and out❤️
7351	942	Excellent recipe!!
7352	942	great frosting
7353	942	The taste is good...but it never did really get thick..yes I followed the recipe to the letter...will look for another recipe
7354	309	I’ve been making frog eyed salad for a long time now, I agree w above user it’s fun to see all the different renditions. Reading this, I am blown away how one can use an entire 16oz of acini de pepe 40oz of cannned pineapple, 33 oz of mandarin oranges, all the other ingredients & serve 10!? I had to take out one heaping cup of noodles & it was still over powering on the noodles. I also add strawberry, fresh pineapple, maraschino, cherries, & I only ever use the white marshmallows because I want the fruit & noodles to be the star of the show. Came here for measurement recommendations- regretted it lol. Well now I have some in the freezer hoping to thaw out for next time.
7355	309	I could eat this every day!
7356	309	I've made this several times. I made as directed and also used vanilla pudding in place of the other ingredients. Both ways are good. Just for fun I add some halved grapes making it look a little more like " frog eyes.
7357	309	I've always loved frog eye salad. It makes a lot and is  real crowd pleaser. I refrigerate the fruit ahead of time, make the pasta and custard and refrigerate together over night. Then I combine with the fruit and marshmallows (colored ones are fun), and I also add green grapes!
7358	309	Family favorite.  I used less sugar, only pineapple chunks or tidbits, fruit cocktail, and tropical fruit.  I change it up every time.
7359	309	I used strawberrys
7360	309	Love this recipe.  Seemed like an ordeal when I first read the recipe, but it is really not bad!  You can even cook the pasta ahead and rinse it very well with cold water and store in frig, then loosen it up with a fork so it is not clumped and make the lemon sauce when you are ready!  Be sure to add the marshmallows last minute and it keeps a few days in the frig!
7361	309	I made it exactly as the recipe is written, and it seems too heavy on the pasta, acini de pepe. I doubled the amount of Cool Whip and added more marshmallows. This was a little closer to the frog eye salad I remember from years ago. If I made it again, I would cut the pasta almost in half.
7362	309	I make this salad for holidays and it is enjoyed by my family.  I leave out the marshmallows and sprinkle the coconut on top of individual servings to accommodate personal tastes.
7363	944	2/5 This recipe produced these wonders. I know. :D Beauties. (100%)!However:1. Runny stuff for sure though. (Had to more than double the icing sugar volume and then leave it out half a day to harden).2. Arguably not particularly pipe-able.3. Gingerbread cookie decorating brought a lot of laughs.  Highly recommend with fun, good crafty creative peoples for the holidays. :-)
7364	944	So runny
7365	944	Great recipe! However, I'd you want a good gingerbread face piping consistency, DO NOT USE 1/4 cup of milk. I added it in gradually, so I would stop once it was at the right consistency, and I barely used 1/8th cup.
7366	944	I would give this zero stars if I could. Ruined my day with how god awful this recipe is. Just terrible. Everyone saying that following the directions yields good frosting is wrong. This is NOT frosting. Even if you add a whole pound of sugar, it is a glaze at best. Not only that, it doesn't taste good at all. Allison's mother clearly did not know how to bake.
7367	944	Ok, so I see a lot of the same stuff; "IT'S TOO RUNNY" or "I HAD TO ADD FIVE CUPS OF SUGAR TO THICKEN IT" and "IT WOULDN'T THICKEN". Please, please, please just read the directions, and carefully. Don't add all the milk.  Do it teaspoon by teaspoon or tablespoon by tablespoon. You're eventually going to find your perfect thickness. If it's still too runny, try the refrigerator, and if you really need yo, add a bit of extra sugar, but not the whole bag. Also, add a bit of flavor if you feel like it.  :)
7368	944	I wouldnt use this recipe i tried making icing for my cookies and the icing wouldt firm up at the listed quatitys its runny and doesnt harden i added extra sugar after and it still doesnt harden and is still runny
7369	944	It was so thin and really runny. Don’t even try this.
7370	944	Worked really well. We divided and made several colors. (Got ahead of the directions regarding the milk, but that was my fault. I knew better...)
7371	944	Went perfectly with my gingerbread cookies but was a little too funny and sweet.
7372	945	Used a little less of the sweetened condensed milk, added 1.5 teaspoons coconut extract to vanilla cake mix and made lightly sweetened whipped cream as the topping.  It was fabulous!
7373	945	I've made this cake for years and it's AWAYS a hit!! So good and easy.
7374	945	Simply Delicious!!
7375	945	This is the absolute best coconut cake I've ever made! I threw coconut extract in everything! I put it in the cake mix, the cream mixture, and the whipped topping. I toasted the coconut before topping the cake with it. I make different variations with it. Sometimes I'll add pineapple to the cake or the whipped topping (draining it before adding) and sometimes I'll add the pineapple and top with maraschino cherries. Delicious!
7376	945	We absolutely loved it. I did a little revision to the recipe because my daughter cannot have dairy or eggs.  I also made them into cupcakes (lol) My daughter had my 9x13 baking dish and I didn't feel like getting it.  The batter made enough for 24 cupcakes.1. Used coconut-sweetened condensed milk instead of the regular brand.2. I also toasted the coconut.Baked the cupcakes, and added the condensed milk/coconut cream mixture. The cupcakes were then moved from the cupcake pan into a new long pan with clean cupcake liners. (still had the old liners on) Half of them were with cool whip and the other half were using the coconut brand ready whip. Topped with toasted coconut and they were great.
7377	945	I have made this cake a million times. It is so delicious and does not last long unless you hide a piece!!
7378	945	This recipe is legit! It's a poke cake folks it is sweet and rich. ALL poke cakes are pretty sweet. If you do not want sweet and rich don't make poke cakes. I made as directed with the exception of the tub whipped topping. I whipped my own if you do that you must stabilize the cream so it doesn't fall and get watery. I use a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla jello pudding to 1 cup. heavy cream works everytime doesn't change the cream flavor. Also I LOVE toasted coconut so I toasted mine. Easy peasy you would never know this is a box cake recipe. The other review about tasting preservatives not sure what they used but it does not taste like preservatives I'm not even sure what that even tastes like 🤣
7379	945	If you love coconut, this cake is the one. Made exactly as recipe states and everyone loved it.  Reminded me of a Tres leche style cake, but with COCONUT goodness..
7380	945	I made this cake for my friend's birthday. Everyone said how delicious it was.  I used real whip cream slightly sweetened with sugar and vanilla instead of using the whipped topping.I would make this cake again and again.  The 2  kinds of milk were perfect;   the cake was lightly moist and delicious.
7381	946	My boyfriend and I don't drink, so I used Ginger Ale instead of beer and added some ginger and Jane's seasoning to the flour.For the sauce, I used peach jam instead of the orange marmalade.Definitely delicious, will make again.
7382	946	Homerun Touchdown Goal!!! Follow this exactly, it is perfect! My only advice is if you are doing big shrimp (12/16) use a 5" skewer for each shrimp to keep it from curling. Also, I make a dipping sauce with 1/2 part Franks Sweet Thai chili sauce and 1/2 part Apricot preserve. Delicious and restaurant quality!
7383	946	These shrimps were delicious.  I did add seasoning to the flour as another person suggested  plus I put the coconut flakes in the processor for a few seconds and kept them in the fridge for several hours.  I also made the orange marmalade with mustard and horse radish dipping sauce as someone suggested.  They were excellent.  Will now have to make them again for my kids.  Thank you for sharing.
7384	946	Easy, quick and delicious. I am a big condiment fan, so just tasting the fresh shrimp was good for me. Refrigeration to allow the batter to set up certainly helps hold it all together.
7385	946	Good coconut batter.  It stuck pretty well to the shrimp.  This is a go to if you like coconut shrimp.
7386	946	Delicious. I used sweetened coconut.  Tonnes of flavor.  I used Bud Light.  Next time I'll try a craft beer.
7387	946	Very sweet, really great as an appetizer or main dish. Some coconut fell off, we strained it out with a fork after each batch but not a big deal. I didn't let it chill very long so maybe that's why. Added in seasonings to my flour: garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Delicious!
7388	946	Delicious! My husband loved it.
7389	946	I followed a tip from other reviewers and chopped the coconut.
7390	947	this is my "go to" for easy chia pudding. I use Aroy D coconut milk, which I really like (the larger sized box is richer - my preference), maple syrup, and it is perfect!  The trick, I have found, is gently whisking after 15-20 minutes, then pouring this into the individual dishes, and letting it sit for all day, or overnight. Perfect and a great source of fiber
7391	947	Yummy!
7392	947	I used 500 ml of Kosa coconut milk. I added 1 tbsp vanilla and honey. Added 1/2 cup shredded coconut.  Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon.
7393	947	easy go to snack. it can be topped with any fruit, like blueberries or blackberries.
7394	947	What a great use of chia!  Top with your favorite fruit.  Thickens nicely and lasts 2-3 days in fridge.
7395	947	I made this with all unsweetened coconut milk and a few tablespoons of finely chopped sweetened shredded coconut.   Easy & delicious!!
7396	947	Used greek yogurt instead of unsweetened coconut milk. Mixed with hemp hearts, ground flax walnuts and blueberries for breakfast. Excellent
7397	947	Deliciously wholesome delight.
7398	947	I made this and followed the directions. It turned out like soup even after stirring the chia seeds that stuck to the bottom. Not much flavor either. Definitely needs help!
7399	948	I have been making this recipe for quire sometime during christmas time. The tembleque always comes out perfect! 🎄🌲🎄🌲 Thanks fir sharing!
7400	948	Simple and delicious! If you have a sweet tooth maybe add just an extra tablespoon of sugar.
7401	948	No changes just kept the recipe going thanks again
7402	948	I make maizena frequently  in my household. I've learned by trial and error the best way to make maizena is to leave the slurry mix of  milk with the maizena on the side and wait for the milk to come to an almost full boil then pour it in and using a whisk, stir vigorously to break up any lumps. When you mix it all together, you run a chance of creating lumps bc the heat won't be distributed all throughout the milk. Before anyone says it's different than making tembleque, it's really not. Tembleque is firmer bc more of the maizena is used. Use less, it creates a creamy custard made for like breakfast.
7403	948	Was easy to make and I love my tembleque warm or cold. So Mom and I had a little bit of it while it was warm and now waiting for it to chill and eat away on the chilled part. My Mom who is 83 was born in Puerto Rico and grew up eating tembleque and really enjoyed a taste of the island.
7404	948	This literally brought tears to my eyes with the first taste (still hot) because it reminded me of my childhood so much! This is a perfect recipe as far as I can tell. Thanks for sharing!
7405	948	This is by far the best Tembleque I've had. As a proud Puerto Rican woman who enjoys and appreciates the foods of our culture, there is absolutely no room for negative reviews for this recipe. Thank you for sharing.
7406	948	Next time, I will tweak it and maybe use coconut cream too. The coconut milk doesn’t have much flavor. Plus I used the unsweetened one, so I am sure that made a difference in flavor. I might throw in some vanilla too.
7407	948	I've made this many times. It's perfect for last-minute gatherings. It's inexpensive, GF (though not corn-free), and easy to adjust the recipe for the expected crowd. I have made this many times and will make it again.
7408	949	I have made these for half a century, most are complaining they are too runny. Here is the reason. The ingredients you boil must be done so until you achieve a rolling boil, reduce heat to medium,  stirring constantly, and only when this mixture is at the 'hard ball' stage (drop a couple of drops into a glass of cold water, if the ball does not disintegrate and remains intact, it is ready) is it ready to be mixed with the dry ingredients. I usually use a pot big enough to take the entire recipe and mix the dry stuff quickly and start dropping by teaspoonful onto waxed paper. If you dawdle, they will harden in the  pot. So the hard ball stage must be met before you finish these cookies. I have tried removing them before they are ready and it is a soft runny mess. Hope this helps, because it is a great little snack, done right.
7409	949	Way way way too much sugar in recipe.Cut the sugar in half (or more),  and it's like my mom used to make.  Yummy.
7410	949	When I made these, they turned out just fine. I love them gooey when they’re warm. You have to put them in the fridge overnight to get the hard texture I think others are looking for. And I let my sugar and cocoa powder mixture boil for a few minutes. I have been using this recipe for years! Love them!
7411	949	I followed this recipe as written with one exception, i withheld a 1/4 cup of the sugar/butter/milk mixture. It just looks like too much liquid to solid ratio, they turned out perfect! Always a favorite treat with Hubs 😊
7613	972	I made these today! They are delicious! I come from Greece so I am not familiar to them.
7412	949	Great flavor, but seemed a bit runny after I mixed it. I let it cool for a bit before I spooned them out.
7413	949	This recipe was delicious but sweet.I expected that obviously because it called fit a lot of sugar lolI have not made any changes.  With most deserts I try to lessen the amount of sugar.
7414	949	Very dense macaroon, won’t make it again.
7415	949	Way too watery!
7416	949	Fabulous,a bite sweet for me. I will adjust sugar next time,but they are  wonderful.
7417	950	I agree with several other reviewers; there is a large amount of oats here for the amount of syrup produced.  I will make these again (with the addition of 1 cup of chopped nuts) with the syrup amounts doubled.
7418	950	My husband’s mother made these for him when he was a kid. He loves them!! I used butter but that’s all I changed.
7419	950	THE BOILING TIME IS WRONG!!  2 mins is NOT enough time to dissolve the sugar.5MINS BOILING TIME REQUIRED!  Mom would also say "don't touch it!", if we went to stir.  She said this recipe is similar to candymaking in that you have to melt the sugar or we would have a grainy loose (but still delicious) mess instead of cookies.  I use butter instead of margarine, as well.  Another tip I use:  Press the mixture into a pan and refrigerate, then cut into bars.  Saves alot of time.  I also use this recipe as a "crust" for ice cream cakes.
7420	950	did not harden
7421	950	I doubled the marg/sugar/cocoa mixture on the second batch I made and they were much better. The first batch were crumply and really dry.
7422	950	I read all the reviews before I tried the recipe. I decided to try it exactly as it's written. I had extra coconut on hand in case it looked like it needed a little more and I probably added one handful more of coconut. I give this to five because it turned out very well and The taste is excellent. I did add the teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture on the stove and it really gave it good flavor. Enjoy
7423	950	This recipe has far too much oat meal.  They were dry and crumbly.  A waste of the ingredints.
7424	950	Following other suggestions to add 2 cups of coconut it was a dry mess. So not the recipes fault but mine but just a warning to try it as is
7425	950	This recipe was GREAT! I did adjust with Earth Balance butter replacement and oat milk to make it dairy-free. It was delicious!!
7426	951	I used 8oz of cream cheese, quarter stick of butter 3.5 cups of powdered sugar , 2tsp vanilla and 2.5 cups of sweetened shredded coconut and they came out great!  Not too sweet and not gooey. I did refrigerate the mixture for about an hour and it was easy to roll.
7427	951	So good!!! 😋 Followed the suggestion of another reader and rolled them in a mixture of cinnamon, cocoa and powdered sugar—it was perfect! Will absolutely use this recipe at Easter for little ‘egg treats’.
7428	951	Excellent recipe! Super simple. They taste great and it only took 30mins total. Not sure how people are having trouble. Definitely need to use powdered/confectioners sugar and butter and cream cheese can not be real soft. Soft but cool to the touch and there shouldn’t be any wetness, and I have never found a need to chill between steps. You MUST use cream cheese in the brick, not the cream cheese spread in the plastic containers. There is a difference. They will be sticky but thats normal. I have made these for years around St. Pat’s day.
7429	951	Worked quite well for me. Makes a lot. Taste great
7430	951	Everytime I try this recipe my mixture is extremely runny and when I try to roll them into ball they just stick to my hands. I am following the recipe exactly how do I stop this! I always try putting them in the freezer or the fridge before I roll but it only helps so much.
7431	951	Awesome, Next time I think I want to pulse the coconut in the food processor before adding it so they are not so stringy from the long strands of coconut
7432	951	These were so easy to make and so good. I made them with my kids and they had a ball making potatoes and rolling them in cinnamon. If you refrigerate the mixture for a bit before rolling them they’re easier to manipulate. I also dipped the mixture in melted chocolate and made Easter eggs!  Delicious!
7433	951	Used half a jar cinnamon.  Made double recipe with half without coconut.  = 2 cups total coconut.
7434	951	This recipe was super delicious! It tasted like potato candy.
7435	952	I typically don’t give bad reviews but this cake was very bland and I really like an Italian cream cake.
7436	952	I found this recipe over 15 years ago. It's my favorite Italian cream cake recipe. I'm a GA girl, so I prefer pecans to walnuts.
7437	952	This recipe is five stars, BUT only with the absolute must do part of separating the eggs. Thus, 4 stars as the result will be greatly affected by the technical aspect. This cake in order to be springy and light needs that extra lifting done by the egg whites. The air incorporated during the beating of the butter an sugar won't be enough and also the leavening agents alone without the beaten egg whites won't do it either. You need to do that step and be mindful of incorporating the whites in thirds without under or over mixing. If the whites are not mixed enough, you might end up with little pieces of egg white in the cake. Also, the buttercream/cream cheese frosting might need to be doubled. I made half of the recipe for testing it. I could have added a third 6" round mold but decided to keep the two and slice both. My cake was in the end a 4 tier cake and it was BEAUTIFUL!!  Since I went this route,  the frosting was not enough to cover the 4 tier cake. I increased the frosting amount using an extra cup of powdered sugar, an extra tbsp of butter, 2 TBSP of heavy cream, and a splash of extra vanilla. The result was FANTASTIC after those appropriate technical and ingredient adjustments for the frosting. For a more decadent flavor, I toasted the coconut flakes to intensify the coconut flavor and make the cake even better!  Overall, it tasted better than any frosted cake I can buy at the grocery store's pastry shop. My grocery store's got good cakes but not like this one.
7438	952	I made this--it was very dry--I think the recipe is right--I feel it was my fault--I let it cook too long.  I have the same recipe--but it tells you to separate the eggs--like the lady said--whip them and fold them into the batter--I suggesst using 2 teaspoons of vanilla and I also added 1/2 cup of pecans chopped to the batter--If you dont make these changes--your cake can be very dry --especially about the time of cooking--that was my main error-
7439	952	I followed this recipe exactly. Although I read the comments about it not releasing from the pan, so I greased AND floured my pans. This cake tested done with a toothpick, but would not release from the pan, it literally TORE IN HALF when it came out. The cake is very dense and greasy, not like a true Italian Cream Cake. This seems more like a greasy, floppy, failure. A vanilla yellow brownie with coconut. I won't be making this one again. Very disappointed, don't even want to bother frosting it.
7654	977	My family loved it. My mom said it was the best she had ever eaten.
7440	952	Made it according to the recipe but did divide the eggs and add the whites to the batter later as suggested.  Did not care for the cake flavor at all.  It was very heavy and lacked taste.  Blah...but the frosting was good so I guess that saved it from one star.
7441	952	Great flavor, I did follow HJONES999 suggestions, plenty of batter.
7442	952	excellent flavor
7443	952	I give this recipe a 10! So good! I read the reviews and opted to make a 2-layer cake. It did rise up to the rim of the pans and fortunately it didn’t overflow. I baked it on 300 for about an hour. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts because I prefer them. I added almond extract to the cake batter and the frosting. I used 3 cups of confectionary sugar instead of 4 in the frosting. I lightly toasted the almonds and coconut. I think untoasted coconut is too chewy. I separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites and then folded them into the batter. I loved this cake and everyone else loved it too!
7444	953	Very easy as well as nice looking follow the recipe to the letter
7445	953	Really glad I found this recipe. I will definitely make again and again. I read others' reviews and used a few of their pointers. I used 3 eggs instead of 2. I only used 1 cup of sugar (we like desserts that are a little less sweet AND my husband is borderline diabetic. I used coconut milk instead of whole milk - but when I make it again, I probably will use half and half.  I also used unsweetened coconut in the filling but sweetened on the top (probably more like 1/4 Cup.
7446	953	Mine turned out great. Yummy 😋
7447	953	Recipe was quick and easy. I followed the modified recipe with the reduced sugarand used evaporated milk and 1 extea egg. It was so easy and delicious, I made 3. It's my new dessert. I gave it a 4 because of the modifications.
7448	953	I made as others recommended. Less sugar, 3/4 cups and used half and half instead of milk. Added a dash of nutmeg at the end. Best Coconut custard pie ever!!
7449	953	My wife never wanted to try this, now it's one of her favorite deserts! Like others I cut the sugar to 1 cup, and it's still plenty sweet. I also substitute half and half for the milk, and use 3 TBS of flour. Simple to make and delicious.
7450	953	My husband loved the pie, the recipe called for 1 1/2 cups of sugar I only used 3/4 cup of sugar came out delicious
7451	953	I followed Foodnut's rendition......Looks great, I added the foil rim at around 30 minutes,
7452	953	Followed recipe to the T and was disappointed with the consistency and texture.  Too greasy and soggy.  ☹️
7453	954	Used egg whites instead real eggs. Make sure you put a good coating cooking spray. Mine stuck a bit. The dip surprised me that it was this good. When I do them next time, I will remove the tails and just pour the sauce of them.
7454	954	I am fairly new to the air-fryer and to be honest was a bit afraid if it. I tried this recipe and didn’t deviate 1 bit! They were perfect-YUM! Thank you for the recipe! I lived the sauce although I had to use a jalapeño as that is all I had!
7455	954	Love this recipe! Only addition was cayenne to the flour and sriracha to the egg wash. Also, I did not see a need to flip the shrimp over when heated air is circulating around them. This one is a keeper.
7456	954	simple easy fun
7457	954	tastes great, but didn't crisp up very much
7458	954	Good, but I missed the step/instruction that says “Coat shrimp well with cooking spray.” Darn! Figured out halfway through air fry time. Was this good? Yes.  Amazing? No but!! Factored my “miss” into the score. The honey lime sauce IS tasty. Thanks Susumiller! I would try this again!
7459	954	Amazing recipe!Word of caution- use gloves when cutting the Serrano Chile or your skin will pay the price!Just saying!!
7460	954	Great recipe!  My husband and I both liked it. Made the dipping sauce as well but left out the peppers and it was great too. Definitely will be making it again.
7461	954	I also had to cook the shrimp a little longer (8 min) from the frozen state but they turned out great.  I appreciated the ease of this recipe and loved making my own coconut shrimp!
7462	955	After reading what everyone said about them being more flat I  just added 1/4 C. more flour and they turned out great! My husband really likes the taste of these cookies with the coconut.
7463	955	I don’t think it’s fair to lower the rating when it might have been Me who screwed up but taking away 1 star because I did follow the recipe exactly only I cut it in half and Im glad I did, it was a waste of ingredients. They spread WAY too much. Was there suppose to be cornstarch??
7464	955	I thought these were delicious and it’s a good cookie base whatever you add. I overcooked them about a minute or so- they were a little too brown- but honestly still moist and delicious. I got about 50 cookies out of the full recipe of what I would consider a medium size cookie. This is a winner! Thank you!
7465	955	Love!
7466	955	Omg these are SO good.
7467	955	Amazing! These were easy to make, delicious, and turned out perfect!
7468	955	This is my 1st review I have ever bothered to write and  WOW !
7469	955	Awesome
7470	955	With this recipe my cookies kept coming out flat so I took another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 stick of butter and it helped a lot. I'm sharing and eating these cookies!
7471	956	I would emphasize to be sure you like the scent of the extracts you use. In any pound cake, the flavoring is really highlighted, and that's especially so for this one which relies on less butter than typical.
7472	956	Very great cake I forgot to do the final step with adding the water sugar and 5 flavors however did everything else as directed and everyone raved about it including the kids wanted to know what to do with the crumbs as they literally enjoyed the crumbs as well
7473	956	This is my absolute favorite dessert! I am not a baker, except for my delicious cheesecakes,  and I’ve always wanted to learn how to make a delicious 5 flavor pound cake that had the crunchy delicious edges.  WELL THIS IS IT!!!♥️♥️♥️I bookmarked this Allrecipes recipe a few years ago, and EVERYTIME I bake this pound cake it turns out delicious and perfect each time!  I baked this one last night and forgot to take a pic of it before my husband and I both ate two big slices each, and gave our granddaughter a small slice. Well, here’s a pic of it anyway, LOL.  It is sooooooooooooooo delicious!FYI, I greased my cake pan well with butter, NO FLOUR.  It came out of the pan perfectly. I ALWAYS follow the recipe to a ‘T’ and there no overflow problems and no problems with flavoring like other reviewers mentioned, JUST A PERFECT CAKE EVERYTIME!I have two very nice Bundt cake pans, so I think it’s a great idea to make sure you get a really good pan for better results if you’ve been experiencing some issues with this recipe.
7474	956	Too artificial flavored
7475	956	I made this cake recently. OMG. It was so good. Took to a small party and didn’t bring much home. The only thing I did differently was I left the cake in the pan out of the oven. Mixed the glaze. Punched holes in the cake and drizzled glaze over it. It makes part of the cake crunchy. The cake was dense
7476	956	I agree with the assessment that five flavors is too much.  The cake has great crumb. texture, and a wonderful sugary crust. But the inside tastes of too many artificial flavors.
7477	956	It turned out well. I wish the glaze had a thicker consistency
7478	956	The cake was delicious!  I will definitely make it again!
7479	956	Best pound cake ever!!!!!! Two thumbs up.
7480	957	My partner is loves carrot cake but is very fussy about it.  He is also sensitive to gluten and very allergic to dairy, so I decided on a whim to give this cake a try using gluten-free flour.  I had low expectations, but we both loved it even without the cream cheese frosting.  So moist and flavorful.   The silver lining of a covid winter with time to try recipes you're not sure will work out.
7481	957	We loved it!Actually sifted all of the dry ingredients together and then tossed the shredded carrots and coconut in with the dry before adding it to the wet which seemed to help with consistent distribution of the goodies!
7482	957	Too wet and oily. Reduce applesauce to 1/2 cup and oil to 1/2 or 1/3. Temperature top Low: change to 180degC for 40mins.The pineapple sauce has not enough acid to react with baking soda. Leaving a metal taste.  Don’t use soda and use more baking powder if need. Acid from fruits are too uncertain to completely neutralise baking soda perfectly.
7483	957	I Increased the carrots to 4 cups.Did not add walnuts or coconut
7484	957	Very moist cake. I added 1/2 cup of soaked raisins and a pinch of Nutmeg. My family loved it and told me it's a keeper for sure.
7485	957	I baked it twice as long as was called for,  it never baked in the middle.   Fell apart.   I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
7486	957	Great base recipe. Here's the changes I made for the best carrot cake ever. Flour: add 1 cup for a total of 3 cups. Baking powder and soda: 1 teaspoon and 3/4 teaspoon. Pineapple: drain well and add 3/4 cups. Add 1 cup of Almond meal. Walnuts: crush before adding. Sugar: substitute with brown sugar and reduce to 3/4 cups. Flavouring: add 1 teaspoon vanilla, reduce cinnamon to 3/4 teaspoons, add 1/2 teaspoon cloves, 3/4 teaspoons nutmeg. Coconut: reduce to 1/2 cup. Oil: reduce to 3/4 cups.
7487	957	This was the moistest carrot cake I’ve ever eaten.   I reduced the oil to 1 cup based on reviews.  But I would use 3/4 cup if I make it again.
7488	957	Excellent recipe!  Love the coconut!
7489	958	This is a good custard pie. The only thing “coconut” about it is the optional cup of coconut flakes. I was a professional baker when I was in my early twenties. I baked at a cafeteria. A very expensive and very good cafeteria. Which is kind of an oxymoron, I know.  Custard pie was one of the pies that was served every day. Custard pie is easy to mess up. Since it has a crust, if there was a flaw in the uncooked crust (like air under the crust), it would rise to the top of the pie and ruin it. It wasn’t served. The only thing that it was good for was for adding to Bread Pudding. That’s why I love this “custard” pie recipe. You can also ruin custard pie if you over beat the eggs.  When you cut the pie into slices, the custard will break apart. It cannot be served. By putting the biscuit mix into the filling, you avoid that, too.
7490	958	For years I have made my children their favorite dessert for their birthday.  Coconut custard pie is my youngest son's favorite, and this is the recipe I have used for years.  It's DELICIOUS and easy to make.
7491	958	What a mess, there is waaay too much liquid, it wouldn't set. I tried lowering the temp and cooking it longer but after an additional 15min it sloped out of the pie pan while simply removing it from the oven. Absolutely would not recommend.
7492	958	I made this YEARS ago but lost my recipe so was happy to find it!  It is not only easy with just a blender to was--it's also scrumptious!  I make it several times a month!  Thank you!
7493	958	Great!  Easy!  Tasty!
7494	958	I added some blueberries to the batter!!!  It's nice, chilled!!
7495	958	I've had this recipe since when Bisquick first came out with it.  love it - easy to make. even without a blender.
7496	958	So yummy and so easy!  Only thing I did differently was pulse in a little over  1/2 cup of coconut into the mixture after the 3 minutes.  I still added the coconut to the top also. I think it would have been bland without the coconut in the mixture.
7497	958	I'm a pretty darn good cook.  I made this pie... and it just didn't "set up" .  It was "soup".  Then I went back and re-read the recipe.   I FORGOT THE EGGS!!!  Oh well.. it TASTES good.  I'll put the "soup" over vanilla ice cream.  I DO want to make this again... WITH eggs!!!!
7498	959	It's such a good recipe that I've made it 3 times in one week. I used skinless thighs, and fresh ginger (a lot!) and garlic. I didn't have spinach so I sauteed fresh mushrooms and added a nice handful of  spring onions. The taste is amazing. Thank you for the recipe.
7499	959	Very nice. I added fresh garlic, shallot and fresh green chilli. Even my fussy 10yr old ate it.
7500	959	Tasteful! I sautéd garlic, ginger initially. Removed it from the pan. Cooked the chicken (cut and rubbed with all the spices below). Added potatoes, red bell peppers, baby corn/chestnuts. Sprinkled onion powder, garlic salt, ginger powder, salt & pepper. Sautéd it a bit more before I added the 2 cans of coconut milk. I simmered on the stove for 20 mins before I added the spinach. And I sprinkled the above spices again and let it cook for another 5mins. Family liked it.
7501	959	I just made this Chicken Recipe and I like it, but it may be too spicy. Thanks for the Article. it helps me a lot. and I have seen Another Recipe it was so good at making and It too Delicious Here you look at up https://www.wahrecipes.com/chicken-curry-with-homemade-coconut-milk/
7502	959	This is sooooO good! I added a teaspoon of paprika powder for smoky flavour. I din't have spinach so I used potato and carrots instead. #foodgasm
7503	959	Great flavor. Don't skip the second can of coconut milk! I made the mistake of following others by only using one can. I ended up having to make a second batch of sauce to serve leftovers. You can add as much ginger as you like (fresh or powdered) I will make this again with TWO cans of coconut milk and some patis (fish sauce)- for authentic Filipino ginataang taste.
7504	959	This recipes packs a big ginger kick!  For my family's palate, we needed onion to help bring out the sweetness here--as written, the recipe doesn't call for any onions.  We didn't use chicken, and instead used chickpeas.  I also agree with the author, daplo, that cooks should liberally salt this dish!  It needs the flavor punch.
7505	959	Simple. Easy. Good. Will make it again. We love ginger in our house.
7506	959	I followed all instruction and tasted it.  It was okay.  The flavors blended well, I added garlic salt, curry powder, brown sugar and cayenne.  Yummers!!!!
7507	960	I am a Puerto Ricn Chef who specializes in Comida Criolla.  Coquito does not have egg in the traditional recioe is actually made with real coconuts the real nuts are who put egg into it.  Taste a whole alot better without also mix it by hand not in a blender.
7508	960	Best Recipe I've used to make it in a long time. Remind me of my abuelo's recip. We'll definitely keep this one in my recipe book to do over and over again.
7509	960	Great recipe. I use coconut milk in the can instead of coconut cream, this way you can skip the water and add more booze. If you temper your egg yolks properly it's WAY more tasty.  Edge your serving glass with shaved coconut flakes! Use bacon fat on the rim if your doing small portions
7510	960	I loved it. The rum is there to dilute the sweetness of the drink so if you make it virgin remember to add something that won't add too much more sugar to the drink like coconut water or it will be too sweet. I use coconut flavored rum (Don Q) and coconut water so as to not diminish the coconut flavor.  I wouldn't recommend any spiced rums unless you are into that. It would take away from the subtle taste of the coconut. If you are a traditionalist then go through the extra work of squeezing the milk from ground coconut so it tastes like your grandmother's, otherwise save yourself time and the extra labor by getting good quality coconut milk. I am parcial to the Goya brand. Buen provecho.
7511	960	I use this coquito recipe every year because I love it so much. Since I don't like eggs in my coquito, I omit the eggs and water and add an extra can of evaporated milk instead. Since eggs don't have to be cooked I just throw everything directly in the blender, except for the 2nd can of evaporated milk (because it doesn't fit), pour it into a pitcher, and stir in the 2nd can. Usually gone within hours in my family.
7512	960	This is my favorite Coquito recipe. It comes out great every year! I make 3-4 bottles each Christmas and it goes fast!
7513	960	Awesome, easy and delicious!
7514	960	OMG....my new holiday favorite hands down.! Thank You. I just doubled recipe (and extra rum!) It was DELICIOUS!! I think next time I will double and add a extra can of cream of coconut.
7515	960	I’ve made this two years in a row and it’s so delicious. Only thing I did different was add a cup of rum. It’s not too strong not too sweet it’s just perfect. It’s so easy to make also my go to!
7516	961	yummmmmm
7517	962	Absolutely delicious! Just used raw sugar instead of white sugar. Love the finished cookie!!
7518	962	These are so good!
7519	962	These are fantastic.  I served them at a book club and everyone was raving. My new 'go to' chocolate chip cookie recipe.
7520	962	Use chocolate chunks instead of chips.
7521	962	These Cookes are terrific.  Easy to make and enough to share with friends and family at the Holidays. I didn't have enough chocolate chips, so added semi sweet chopped chocolate.
7522	962	Love this recipe! The coconut flakes really add to the chewy goodness!
7523	962	I let my butter get too warm so they spread out. Tried it again and made sure my butter was cold enough and they were fantastic!
7524	962	Substituted monkfruit for granulated sugar, used macadamia nuts, and toasted the coconut. Delish.
7525	962	They’re good, not great.  Aside swapping pecans for walnuts - I stuck to the recipe.
7526	963	East to make. My mom made these for us as kids. They are popular with everyone that I gift them to!
7527	963	I have made these for years but never added sugar
7528	963	These have always been one of my favs. I didn’t realize I was outta chocolate chips so I used white chocolate instead and drizzled with chocolate syrup. Tasty!
7529	963	This didn't turn out like bars at all. Followed the recipe exactly. Have to eat it in a bowl with a spoon.
7530	963	I’m giving this a high five bc it’s a great cookie.  This time I made them I didn’t have graham crackers.  So, I crushed up Ritz crackers and used them in place of the graham crackers.  My family says they score a 5+ and want to name the cookies with my substitution Hello Cindy’s.
7531	963	I did not make any changes, I make them every Christmas and they are scruptious
7532	963	It had a very yummy taste with all those ingredients together(i didnt include the pecan, but it was ok). The only thing that bothered me was that I couldn`t do the cracker crust. I removed the sugar(as a user recommended) and put just the crackers and the melted butter together but the crumbs didn`t really stick together no matter what I did.  Should i use the flaked coconut to stick the crumbs too? Also, I had to put more than 2 cups of crumbs because my pan was really big
7533	963	Easy to do and delicious!
7534	963	The recipe specifies the wrong size pan. This should be a 9x13 or 11 x 8. As written, the recipe results in a sticky, greasy, gooey mess. I tried to fix it by additional cooking time at a slightly higher temp. If there is a next time, I would skip the sugar in the crust and reduce the amount of butter. I like the idea of putting the coconut on top for texture. I just prefer shredded coconut, no toasted.
7535	964	A great receipe to share when teaching your grandkids how to use stove and measurement
7536	964	I have made these many times, just not with this recipe. The ratios of wet to dry seemed off, they ended up very crumbly.
7537	964	underwhelming
7538	964	They seemed pretty good swapped peanuts for slivered almonds
7539	964	So easy and so tasty. I always add a little kosher salt from my salt grinder after I set them to cool.
7540	964	I add 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Instead of nuts.
7541	964	Yummy
7542	964	they are realy good
7543	964	I made it with out the peanuts and everyone who's had them think they are amazing my husband says it reminds him of the haystacks he had as a child (Grandma used to make)
7544	965	Other than substituting my own favorite fruits, I wanted to share a BEAUTIFUL serving method our mother used: fill the hollowed-out half of an ORANGE peel, then freeze them
7545	965	Wonderful!! I used a pkg of instant pudding instead of sugar with the cream cheese and whipped topping, mmm yummy! And also I had on hand marshmallows instead of coconut and red and green grapes, chunky pineapple instead of crushed and a apple. loved it, thank you for the recipe, the possibilities are endless
7546	965	So so good. Everyone in my home loved it and it was super easy and affordable to make! I made a double batch and still paid less than $15 for all the ingredients!
7547	965	Awesomeness on a plate!  I skipped all the sugar as fruit, coconut and whipped cream was sweet aplenty!
7548	965	I use this recipe at Thanksgiving every year and have for the past 6 years. Everyone loves it. I do change up the fruit in it from year to year though.
7549	965	I could not find any Jonagold apples so I used a Fuji apple, I do not like raisins so I left them out and I forgot the pineapple but hey it turned out really good anyway.
7550	965	The salad is delicious! I added the cherries but not raisins or nuts. Just used what I had. We put small amount of mini marshmallows on top.
7551	965	Doubled the recipe, it was so delicious.
7552	965	I made this salad for Thanksgiving with a few changes on the fruit due to tastes. It was a hit! Now I'm asked to bring it again for Christmas. Thanks for the recipe!!
7553	966	It's the only popcorn recipe that I make.
7554	966	I was the best Popcorn I've ever made, and we eat a lot of popcorn! This will be my go to for popping corn from now on!
7555	966	It took a few times and different pots to get this right. But, it is good and I like how it is without additives.
7556	966	I have made popcorn in coconut oil for years. take it to another level and use baby white popcorn!  it is available online if you do not find it in your area. It is usually found in Amish or farming communities. it has very few hulls and much more flavor!
7557	966	made 1/2 a cup with 3 tbs coconut oil and 1 tbs canola oil.
7558	966	Perfect as is!  My new favorite snack.
7559	966	The best way to make popcorn.
7560	966	This worked great!  I normally vegatable oil, and this came out just the same.
7561	966	Love this!! I wanted a "white cheddar" taste so I decided to add 1tbsp of grated parmeasan cheese and two pinches  of garlic powder along with three turns of pink himalayan sea salt to the whole batch after it was done. So so delicious!! love this recipe.
7562	159	I use 6 foil loaf pans to bake then and I  use toothpick method, about 50 mins. that way you can put them in ziplock bags for freezer after they cool in their pans. They last a while and you don't eat it all at once. Easier to share. At Christmas, for special friends, I just pull 1 or 2 loaves out of the freezer,  thaw. Remove from bag (if you want) and at that time of year you can usually find decorative plastic bags to put it in as a gift. Make sure you use a plastic that has good closures. I usually present it, in its loaf pan, to keep freshness. Suggestion: maybe you can use bottle style bags to fit the pan in. You may want to put it in Dry ziplock or any proper size freezer bags if using liquor store bags made of just heavy paper. You only need to open the foil a little and it will always pop out, if you greased your pans etc.
7563	159	It is the best & moist cake. My mother makes them every Christmas.
7564	159	This cake was super yummy.  Next time I’m not going to add the raisins or the nuts for personal preference only. Will definitely make again!
7565	159	fantastically yummy
7566	159	I got the starter from a friend and although the final cake is good, it cost me $100 from start to finish! Good cake .... NOT worth the cost! If you have to make the starter, add on another $50! Not so much friendship! :(
7567	159	I am giving this 4 only because I haven't baked the cake yet, but the starter looks and tastes great! My 50 days is up tomorrow and I'm confused by the cake recipe. I know I need to freeze the starter if I'm not going to use it within a week. If I am going to use it within a week, do I put it in a jar on the counter or put in the fridge? I know the starter can be used to make another batch of starter, but how much do you use and what do you put in future starter batches? Thanks. I hope I get answers by tomorrow!
7568	159	I remember my mother making this in the 90's. I was so happy to find this recipe. I had to start the starter so this has been 50 days in the making. I was very worried because towards the end of the process my fruit smelled like bad homemade wine, but I stuck it out and the end product was really good moist, tasty fruit cake. This recipe makes 4 cakes. I used loaf pans. I baked the first 2 at 325 as called for but the center didn't rise and kind of sunk. The next 2 I baked st 350 for about 55 minutes and they turned out perfectly. I've got another fruit starter going now I plan on making small loaf pans and giving to neighbors for Christmas. Thanks for this recipe.
7569	159	We love the cake.  It says you can freeze the cakes for later. Does anyone know for how long?  Also, does anyone know if you can freeze the fruit?  One more question:   what can the starter be frozen in?
7570	159	I have been making friendship cakes for over 20 yrs  & everyone loves them! this recipe is a little different than mine,I add 2 & 1/2 cups of sugar to the peaches  & the  pineapple ,but add no sugar to the cherries.This recipe doesn't mention if you drain the juice from the cherries(I do) on the 30th day my cakes (cause I make 3 at a time)consist of only the yellow cake mixes,eggs,vanilla instant pudding,cooking oil & 1 & 1/2 cups of fruit  per cake.I bake them in a tube pan.at 350 oven for 1 hr.  I am looking forward to trying this recipe that adds nuts,coconut & raisons.Thankyou!
7571	968	Tasted great. I subbed the honey for maple like it said you could. I cooked for 8 minutes so they could be chewy. Mine fell almost completely apart. I will try again with honey. Really disappointed because I wanted to take a healthy treat to my pregnant daughter.
7572	968	Great recipe – I make this every Sunday to last us through the week. I cut the honey in half and skip the vanilla (too sweet for us!), and add more peanut butter to make up for it. I also use roughly chopped unsalted mixed nuts and pepitas instead of the coconut to make it more filling. And I bake for 6-7 minutes at the end so they still hold their shape. Thanks for the recipe!
7573	968	These were really easy to make and very tasty! I look forward to trying different variations! I did find that scoring them while still warm did help with cutting them.
7574	968	This recipe is SO easy. I've made it several times and the bars turn out perfect every time!
7575	968	When fully baked these bars are almost identical to a KIND bar.  So, I microwaved mine for 25 seconds to soften a little, a personal preference. I would recommend cutting them straight out of the oven before cooling.  I cut mine after cooling and they were crumbly in spots.  Also, I found the honey a bit overpowering, so I may try maple syrup instead.  Definitely an adaptable recipe in which I can see adding nuts, dried fruit, and/or substituting other nut butters for the peanut butter.
7576	968	I added cashews, walnuts, chia seeds, wheat germ and pumpkin seeds, decreasing the oats accordingly. I also added cinnamon and dried cranberries. It was a bit too sweet, but I liked the granola mixture I made. Perhaps if I had left out the cranberries, it wouldn't have tasted so sweet.
7577	968	Loved this recipe as a base, although I changed it up a lot. Added tahini instead of peanut butter, increased quantities of shredded coconut to 1 c, increased nuts (used cashews) to 1 c., added maple syrup, tahini, date paste, rose water, vanilla, and honey to the liquid heat step.
7578	968	Very easy and delicious!  They’re a little sweet, but held together pretty well.  I baked at 300 with convection for 8 min and cut soon after removing from oven, pressing back down into the pan to cool.  Next time I will reduce the oats a little and add chopped nuts.
7579	968	Great taste. It was a hit with my kids and my co-workers.
7580	969	Wonderful. Best cake I've ever had
7581	969	Very good (VERY sweet), great for at-home dessert. Not attractive enough to serve for others, but that was expected. I made exactly as printed, and had no problems baking it for 30 minutes in a convection oven. I wonder if the butter should have been melted, as the cream cheese frosting was much too thick to pour. Not sure if I will make again - good, but there are many better cake recipes out there.
7582	969	It was well worth the time to bake this.  Just remember to keep the cream cheese mixture 1" back from the edge of the pan (if you do not it overflows in the oven).  Also put a cookie sheet under it in the oven.  Very good!
7583	969	My cream cheese didn’t mix in with the chocolate cake! And one corner was sunken!
7584	969	Excellent cake, my husband loved it. Made as recipe called. Took advice of others and saved some of the cake for top.
7585	969	I’m a baker. I do this all the time. This may taste great but it looks awful. I’m embarrassed to serve it but the birthday dinner is in 3 hours so I guess I don’t have a choice but to serve it! I followed advice here and made it in a Bundt pan to make it “prettier”. I also added time to cooking per recommendations. This is still what I got. I won’t make it again.
7586	969	Delicious
7587	969	it was very easy to do and was a big hit at our Church movie night
7588	969	The sugar in cream cheese can be halved I think it made the cake gooey and everyone thought it was way too sweet overall.
7589	970	I was searching for the ideal sticky jasmine rice to serve with my off the cuff Thai beef stir fry, bingo! After reading all the reviews, I made these adjustments. 1/2 t. salt, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 t. turbinado sugar, 1star anise. Cooked as directed. Perfect for packing into a ramekin for presentation. Everyone enjoyed it. The subtle flavors of the coconut, bay leaf, star anise & slight sweetness was the yin to the yang of the spicy stir fry.
7590	970	I really enjoyed this! Used my Instant Pot! Just a few things to add...1. I made this in my Instant Pot..set on manual high for 5 minutes, natural release 5 minutes, vent rest of steam.2. I just stirred together the milk, water, sugar, and salt in the bottom of the pot...no heat...before adding the rice.2. I used 1 3/4 cup rice.3. Make sure when adding your 1 1/4 cups of water, first swirl the water in the coconut milk can to really rinse out the can and get all of the coconut goodness 😉 before adding to the mixture.4. Make sure you stir the rice to coat it with the milk mixture before closing the lid.5. It has a nice coconut flavor! I made this to go with lemon and butter pan seared scallops. Super easy and yummy! I will definitely make it again.
7591	970	I grew up in Hawaii and I have been trying to recreate a rice dish I had when I was 4 - very long time ago - and never could.  Now I did ... and it was awesomeness!
7592	970	What a great and easy recipe!  The texture to this dish is excellent, cooked for 20 minutes- it thickens slightly, as it sits for a few minutes, after completing.  Be sure to use a fork to fluff it after it is done since the rice tends to stick together when you add coconut milk.  I found it perfect just as written- in addition, you can add a few green onions to it to change it up if you think that would be something you'd enjoy.  Just a few!  I served this with a Lebanese chicken dish but it would go beautifully with a curry-based dish as well.  Thanks Tony!
7593	970	I loved this rice. I made it to go with a spicy meal and it worked out perfectly. I will definitely make it again.
7594	970	SO delicious!!!
7595	970	Excellent I loved it, thanks
7596	970	I guess I’m not a fan of coconut rice. It was more like a dessert. It tasted good but wasn’t what I was looking for as an accompaniment.
7597	970	This dish was too rich and sweet for us. It really overpowered any other main dinner dish, so I ate it for breakfast. I prefer the more savory coconut rice recipes over this one.
7598	971	Lovely. Thank you for sharing.
7599	971	Such a yummy recipe.  This recipe can feed 12 people easily.
7600	971	Yes, definitely it needed more nuts,raisins,coconuts,etc.
7601	971	Tried making this and it turned out great. Love it!
7602	971	made this today, didn't really measured anything and I omitted the coconut,(personal preference)  everyone loved it, BTW I live in the middle east (UAE)and this was as good as the one at my favorite place.
7603	971	Definitely serve with icecream
7604	971	My 14 year old daughter who has never baked or cooked anything more complicated than a grilled cheese sandwich made this, followed the recipe to a tee and it was absolutely delicious!
7605	971	I just came back from a trip to Middle East and was dying to make this myself. The recipe was super easy and it tasted great but it turned out less moist than I remembered it to be - I think the dish I used was too big for the volume of milk in the recipe. Also next time I think I'll put it under the broiler just before eating since it doesn't take long at all. It's best eaten warm and fresh from the oven.
7606	971	Needs a little less milk...not quite sure about that. May reduce it a bit or thicken the milk with some gelatin or cornstarch or use cream instead. As for the flavor, it's good. But the kind I've eaten before had rosewater in it and that does make a huge difference.  A small dash adds a bit of unique flavor.
7607	972	it was messy and nasty
7608	972	they tasted really good but the cake started to fall apart when I dipped it in the icing so I just poured it on top and it worked well!!
7609	972	This recipe was great,  although after leaving it uncovered for the night like one reviewer suggested, I couldn’t put a fork into it (if I had it would’ve crumbled), so instead I used a spoon to spread the icing onto the lamington (which I held in my other hand), which worked great. There was also way more coconut than needed.
7610	972	Lots of lovely variations of Lamingtons gives us that richness of flavour from the colour coated icing on the outside embedded in dessicated coconut. It's a basic recipe, very affordable and easy to make.  I do recommend that if it is your first lamington to keep it simple and natural with flavours. Definitely first baking experience just an original Lamington without fillings to be able to perfect a Lamington before adding your own variations. Delicious for the entire family served with vanilla ice cream simply for great taste. ?? I love Lamingtons and definitely a huge hit for children as well as adults. You can never go wrong with making it IF you make sure to keep it Fresh soft on the inside AND on the outside with the coconut coloured flavoured icing. Thumbs up??
7614	972	This recipe was yummy and fairly easy to make. The only problem was how crumbly the cake was when I was trying to coat it in chocolate. I would suggest, and did use Dixie cups. I put the little piece of cake in, and then poured the icing on top, along with the coconut shreads.
7615	972	The tip to freeze before cutting is key.  I also, surprisingly, needed more frosting then the recipe called for.
7616	973	The flavor of the pecans was amazing! Way better than I ever have tasted with ready made icing!!
7617	973	Made this exactly as written. Took a little longer to reduce than  indicated, but a little patience and a lot of stirring paid off. This went perfectly on my wife's devils food chocolate chip birthday cake.
7618	973	I used the addl instructions provided by Christine James. So I let it go to a 'smack' boil and then 5 minutes more. It's really good. Good color, texture and taste.
7619	973	Since I didn’t have evaporated milk I used Vitamin D instead and reduced it down. Super easy
7620	973	I will never buy another can of this store frosting! So much more flavor fresh. Loved it!
7621	973	I already left previous comments, I forgot to add, it helps to whisk the egg yolk into the evaporated milk before heating, and adding other ingredients, so the egg is mixed well.   This is a tasty recipe.  Ive made it with unsweetened coconut, and sweetened, I like it either way.
7622	973	This is the recipe you will find inside the wrapper of a bar of Baker’s German Chocolate. I have used this recipe for 57 years and have never had a failure.  People rave about the frosting. Thanks for sharing on All Recipes so I don’t have to pull out my cook book any more!!
7623	973	Super easy and scrumptious!!!
7624	973	Omg I can’t believe it’s this easy! And delicious (I did add extra coconut and pecans, just because ??) but this recipe is great, thank you sooo much!
7625	974	husband loved it! we only used strawberry banana red crisp apple and raspberries for the fruits. I think a vanilla yogurt might be worth trying next time. i added more granola and ate the left over crema with some granola. can't wait to make this again ! ill have to use honey next time
7626	974	This was excellent! I used all the fruit listed plus pineapple just because I had some. I could eat the crema mixture all by itself.
7627	974	Great recipe! Love this stuff! I could live on bionicos alone all summer!  I use regular sour Creme and usually vanilla yogurt. This recipe is so forgiving you can make  personal changes without really changing the results. It’s all a matter of taste. Thanks for sharing!
7628	975	For 9x13” pan I would double the frosting recipe.
7629	975	I loved this cake as a child and was so excited to find the recipe and think this is even better than I remember
7630	975	This cake is like a childhood favourite. My mothers family would call it poor man’s cake and this IS the Royal version!
7631	975	I combined the suggestions. (375 g of dates instead of a cup) soaked in boiling tea. I added sliced almonds and almond extract to the topping with a bit extra butter and cream. I also used half white and half brown sugar in the cake. And I cooked in a (bundt) chimney cake pan. 40 minutes cooking time Delicious.
7632	975	It is the best cake I have baked. It is a wonderful cake for a birthday or special occasion. It is also very nutritious.
7633	975	This is a recipe my grandmother used to make for us 60 years ago. I know I have it written in a paper somewhere, but was very happy to find it here. Love it!
7634	975	Super good, moist and flavourful. Only difference from my Grandma’s recipe are the walnuts which i really liked. Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting.
7635	975	Does anyone know how this fabulous cake got its name? A friend brought me a box of dates, and I decided to make this on a whi
7636	975	Such a.. GOOD CAKE!!!! Love this recipe!??
7637	976	Love this.I cooked with a Rice Cooker.   I doubled the Recipe.-  3 rice cooker cups of Basmati.-  2 (14oz) cans of coconut milk-  2 rice cooker cups of water-  2 tsp of sugar-  1 rice cooker cup of shredded coconutI panicked as I thought maybe it might turn out too liquidy.   Once the rice cooker turned off I left the lid closed for 10 mins, then open and stirred.  Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving.  Perfection.  Served with sweet chilli chicken and mango salad.   I will definitely be making this rice again.  Thank you
7638	976	This rice recipe is perfect to accompany Thai peanut sauce chicken!
7639	976	I added a tad bit more water to ensure thorough cooking and crushed red pepper & salt for taste. It went well with my Cajun Shrimp and Edamame
7640	976	Great recipe! This is a wonderful way to add some pizazz to plain old white rice. I did make a slight change to the sugar and added 1 T. I also didn't have any shredded coconut on hand, so I omitted that. My family really liked it!
7641	976	I made it but made a few changes and it was delish! Definite keeper! I doubled the recipe and instead of using two cans of coconut milk, I did one can of coconut milk and one can of coconut cream for a little more sweetness! I also added flakes while cooking and then again on top as a garnish. It came out creamy and smooth and just yummy! It’s a definite keeper! (I also made this to pair with coconut chicken, because I am a Huuuge coconut lover and it was an amazing dinner!).
7642	976	I make this recipe almost weekly and our family loves it.
7643	976	I read reviews suggesting using half coconut milk and half water, so I decided to use one can of sweetened coconut milk, and one 16.9 fluid oz of coconut water with pulp.  I used two cups of short grain white rice.  It came out delicious but may be a bit sweet for some people.  It did total to 54 g of sugar for the whole pot of rice.
7644	976	I put everything in the rice cooker at the same time and it turned out perfectly delicious.
7645	976	My whole family loved this rice, I added 3 tablespoons of sugar and made it sweeter and also shredded coconut it was fantastic!
7646	977	Simple and tasty pie! I used sweetened coconut flakes. I made it as written and it was done at exactly an hour. No changes needed
7647	977	It's more of a custard pie.  I was looking for a good ole fashion coconut pie.  This is good but that is not whated.
7648	977	This was the worst receipe ever! Runny, watery, would not set. Followed instructions to a T but just a mess.
7649	977	This recipe is very similar to the coconut pie my mom used to make. It baked up beautifully and my husband loved it!
7650	977	Delicious!
7651	977	Excellent....came out perfect!  Added extra coconut though, 1/4c....next time I will add meringue, but it is perfect without.
7652	977	Great pie!! It was like a coconut custard pie. We will make this again!
7653	977	Extra coconut, about a 1/4 cup.
7656	978	I made it with the vanilla pudding but I added a little coconut extract as well.  Very easy delicious recipe.
7657	978	I love this recipe.  So easy and the pie came out delicious.  I did toast the coconut.  I also added some can Coco Lopez cream of coconut that I had leftover.  I added this to some milk and mixed to make the 1 1/2 cups.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks.  I Love Allrecipes.
7658	978	Great recipe and so easy
7659	978	This is so quick and easy, and my husband LOVES it.  I used graham cracker crust instead, and it's his favorite dessert!!
7660	978	Great recipe! Super easy and so good! My perfect requirements for a “keeper”. I used Jello coconut cream pudding and French vanilla (small box) instant pudding and added a little coconut flavoring just to pump it up. I put less Cool Whip into the pudding mixture since there was more pudding with the two boxes and also used two cups of milk instead of one and a half as the recipe said. I also used a pre made Graham cracker crust. The rest, just as the recipe said. So tasty and good enough to give as a gift. Thanks for submitting, D.
7661	978	I loved it. My husband loved it too. I was lazy and just used ready made pie crust and it was still delicious.
7662	978	Doubled this recipe for 2 pies, used 4 small boxes of cheesecake flavored instant pudding as store didn't have vanilla or coconut flavor, used 5 cups of milk total, 4 cups of coconut, only half container of cool whip mixed in, 1 cup toasted coconut for tops with a thin layer of cool whip which really let the pudding stand out. It turned out so good with the cheesecake pudding & coconut mixed I was pleasantly surprised & will do again in the future when I can't find coconut cream pudding which is what I usually prefer. This recipe is easy quick & really tasty for no bake
7663	978	Came out delicious!
7664	979	Made this last night - turned out great.  Curry forward for sure- but I would have liked a little more 'kick' and will likely try adding some cayenne or other hot spice next time.  Served over white rice (1 cup rice / 2 cups water was right size).
7665	979	Best curry ever!!!
7666	979	I made the recipe exactly as listed except left out the onions due to an allergy. It was sooo good! The only recommendation is give yourself extra time as it took longer for my InstaPot to pressurize.
7667	979	The image doesn’t reflect my results at all. It should have been called Coconut Curry Chicken Soup. Way too runny. Should have used only paste like was suggested by others. Otherwise, it was tasty.
7668	979	Pro tip: if you don't like how soupy your curry is when making it in the instant pot, add lentils to thicken it up. It makes it more like stew, and it is still healthy and freaking delicious.  I serve it over rice. I've done several variations of curry recipes over the last several months, and they all need a little tweaking. I also omit the broth, but don't drain my tomatoes and use that for the liquid instead.
7669	979	I added about 1.5 C of cauliflower (1/4 head), 1/2 sweet pepper chopped, about 1/2 C of baby carrots, additional 1/2 tsp of curry, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, additional can of chopped petite tomatoes undrained. Added liquid reserved from previous can of chopped tomatoes. More like a soup. Still enjoyed the flavors and consistency. Although next time around, I will drain both cans of tomatoes to see how the consistency turns out.  Four chicken breasts were used. I topped with a dollop of non fat Greek yogurt and chopped cilantro.  Will definitely be going back to this recipe.
7670	979	First time making Thai inspired, I did change a few things after reading other reviews..
7671	979	This tastes perfect.  I believe the next time that I make it, I will use my submersion blender while the chicken is out for shredding.  This will thicken the liquid portion up.  Also, I thought that I had coconut milk in the pantry.  I did not.  So, I went to the liquor cabinet and used a can of Coco Lopez (Lite) and it tastes great!
7672	979	Delicious! This was the best curry dish that I have made thus far. Thank you
7673	980	Easy to prepare and delicious! We served it with jerk chicken at our last dinner party and it was a hit. Even the 18-month old ate a lot of it.
7674	980	I tried this recipe it was easy to follow and amazing.
7675	980	very yummy. perfect recipe just the way it is.
7676	980	I’ve made this several times and it is delicious every time!  Served it with the Firecracker Salmon and it was a huge hit with friends and family!
7677	980	This is really good stuff! We like to enjoy it with lime n coconut shrimp (and veggie) kabobs which we grill on the barbie. They compliment each other very nicely!
7678	980	So good!!  I served this with an asian-inspired grilled chicken with stir fry veggies and it complimented the rice very well.  The only negative I would say is I like my rice a bit more separated and not so stuck together.
7679	980	This recipe is amazing and pretty foolproof. I’ve made it many times and use a rice cooker. Friends ask for it all the time. It’s also gluten free. Great recipe to use with almost any meat or fish!
7680	980	This turned boring plain rice into the star of the meal!  I served it with sauteed fresh veggies and grilled pork tenderloin.  I did use a full teaspoon of salt and because my limes were small I used 3 of them.  Will definitely make this again!
7681	980	Oh yes!!!  I am not a fan of rice, and living in Guatemala, all I can get is white rice.  Sometimes, only pre-cooked rice.  But I soldiered on with this using plain white rice, and had to replace the coconut oil with butter, but otherwise followed this exactly as written.  This was a huge hit among lunch guests.  The flavors were not really strong, but the creaminess from the coconut milk, with the tartness of the fresh limes was refreshing, very different and delicious.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe so I can have  some more for dinner.  Make this.
7682	981	I love this recipe!
7683	981	We liked it!!
7684	981	This turned out gluey and stuck to the bottom of the pan and still was absolutely beautiful! However, instead of Coconut milk, I mistakenly used Evaporated milk! Next time I shall use the correct ingredients!
7685	981	I like this dish, very simple.  Even, I have tried a similar one, please take a look at his too.  https://www.nskwebtv.com/2018/10/coconut-rice-recipe-in-few-easy-simple.html
7686	981	Yes. I altered it with apx. A pinch or quarter tsp of curry and reduced rice amount to 1 1/2 cups of basmati rice and then referred to the liquids in the recipe. I liked it and will make it again.
7687	981	I really liked this.  I made this twice now.  The first time I used regular coconut mike, the second time, I used 3/4 light coconut milk and 1/4 water.  I used 1 part rice to 2 parts liquid.  I cooked it for 25-30 minutes, and had to stir frequently, as this likes to boil over.  I used a whole grain Basmati rice.
7688	981	This is my new go to recipe for basmati rice.  It is simply delicious and came out perfectly!
7689	981	Made one cup of rice with one can of coconut milk (400ml) and it was perfect amount for two to three people. Awesome recipe. So glad I tried it. Definitely on my fav list.
7690	981	it tased weird
7691	982	It was great,I cook this often …honestly I just put all ingredients together and mix and is done …oh the sugar is a bit of a mess ,just make sure u have a good pan
7692	982	Loved this flan, the coconut was such a nice touch!!
7693	982	Perfect flan! I followed the advise to replace 1 can evaporated milk with 1 can coconut milk. The texture was PERFECT.
7694	982	I forgot to add milk but it came out great anyway!
7695	982	I tried it today for the first time and my family loved it !
7696	982	I add it coconut cream and a little vanilla it was perfect
7697	982	I honestly don’t know how but it was delicious I just had issues making the caramel !!!
7698	982	Excellent recipe! Prepared pretty much as described except that I substituted the milk for cream and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup. Great texture and taste. Next time I will add more fresh coconut and reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.
7699	982	Great tasting and very easy to make
7700	983	We loved it. I made it with half and half because that is what I had handy. It was very rich, not an every day oatmeal, but it was delicious.
7701	983	Delicious and easy to make. I used about 2.5 cups of heavy cream and a little over 1 cup to get 3.5 cups in replacement of the coconut milk. I had left over heavy cream from the holidays thst I wanted to get rid of before it went bad. The oatmeal turned out creamy, flavorful and thick. My husband and 2 year old loved it. I doubled the recipe and so instead of using 2 tsp of cinnamon,  I would recommend 1.5 tsp. Thank you for the recipe.
7702	983	Personally, I prefer 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.
7703	983	Made with coconut Silk instead of coconut milk.   Lessened amount of brown sugar and honey added a touch of nutmeg with the cinnamon  along with golden raisins, toasted pecan pieces and coconut flakes.  Poured a little more Silk on the top.  It was really good.  So easy to make!
7704	983	Decadent. Flavorful in an almost rice pudding way but warm and Christmasy. Golden raisins and pecans would take it next level.
7705	983	This was tasty. However light coconut milk will definitely be the replacement next time. Or just half can and half water... This Was a bit too rich and thick.
7706	983	Never could I have imagine oatmeal with coconut. Especially the milk of the coconut. It is wonderfully tasty and I think it may have just been added to my oatmeal week.
7707	983	I made this recipe exactly as listed except, I had no canned coconut milk, so I used Silk Coconut milk. It was tasty, and with the Silk coconut milk it has a lot fewer calories than the canned. I topped it with raw honey, a handful of blueberries and a splash of coconut milk. I would most definitely make it again.
7708	983	This was delicious! I had half a can of coconut milk left over and was scouting Allrecipes for a way to put it to use. I used 2/3 c of coconut milk, about 1 c water, 1 c rolled oats, and 5 generous dashes of cinnamon. I brought the coconut milk and water to a gentle boil (barely looked like boiling) with the lid on the pot - took about 20 minutes. After mixing the oatmeal in, I let it sit for 15 minutes without the lid, then stirred in cinnamon and immediately removed the pot from the stove. The oatmeal was rich and creamy, with a perfect amount of coconut and cinnamon flavor. 10/10 would make again
7709	984	This is the Best Coconut Pie ever.
7710	984	This recipe is delicious but I put everything in the blender and mix it. We love it!!!
7711	984	I haven't made this for a couple of years, I revived it tonight and it turned out as great as always.  I too use a glass pie dish and bake at 350 for 40 minutes.  I am one who doesn't care for coconut, but truly love this pie.
7712	984	I thought it tasted great!  I used organic unsweetened coconut, so the sweetness was just right.  I didn't get a "crust" like I expected.  But, my grandmother would grease/flour her pie plate for her "makes a crust custard pie".  I will do that the next time.  I don't think I let it cook long enough or cool long enough.  As it was a little runny.  BUT still oh so good!  I will try again with this one.
7713	984	Not much flavor and more cooking time was needed.
7714	984	If you’re a coconut and custard pie lover, this one is perfect and easy!  It makes its own crust, but still custard like.  I took someone’s suggestion and used only 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  A nice sprinkle of nutmeg on top before baking made it even more delicious!  I didn’t use a blender, just a hand whisk.  Will definitely make this again.
7715	984	This is wonderful and easy,,,,, but,,,your adjustment for servings is messed up... The first one I made today was for 10 servings and the ingredients were way off,,, eggs were right I think but everything else was off... the pie turned out like corn bread with coconut blah!!! what a waste of time and ingredients
7716	984	I made it!!!
7717	984	This was pretty good. I used 3 eggs, 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1 cup of sugar, and coconut milk. After cooling in the fridge for a few hours, it had a slight eggy taste, but it was a lot better the next day!
7718	985	I love this recipe. I always cut the sugar in half, and use whipped cream rather than any icing, topped with toasted coconut. It's always a hit at the potlucks! It's also my default Easter cake with the addition of pastel colored jelly beans!
7719	985	Delicious, though a little too dense for my taste - but I had only used 1 Tbsp. baking powder. Will try again with 2 Tbsp.
7720	985	A half recipe fit perfectly in my instapot Bundt pan. I added some orange peel to the cake and frosting only because I had some available, otherwise it would be delicious without any.
7721	985	Perfect, moist, sensational springtime cake
7722	985	This recipe made a very delicious cake. I added half a cup more flour as I found it too runny though
7723	985	Wow! This recipe is great. I made a gluten-free version and the cake is really moist and soft. I used Doves farm self-raising flour. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) and 1 tablespoon honey (so the cake will remain moist). I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt and used 35g LESS sugar. (I did not use plain flour and baking powder). I baked in a preheated gas oven, gas mark 4, for 1hr 20mins. I also added some lemon zest and vanilla essence. Next time i’ll add some lemon juice.
7724	985	Super moist recipe. Loved it. Easy to make.
7725	985	easy to make tasty
7753	673	It only made 1 loaf and halfSo I used  2 mini.loaf for remaing batter.Mango bread is delish. Second time making it.
7754	989	My husband and I love this. Sweet and chewy.  Great gluten free treat
7726	985	Wow, this recipe was perfect : it had the exact ingredients I had available at home🤩 I just used half of the quantities, to make it smaller 👍 mine looks a bit uncooked in the middle but the indicated cooking time is perfect; it looks like this because I added pieces of Lindor white Chocolates the last ten minutes and I think the sugar melted! 🙈 Cannot add more photo but you should see it sliced and with the chocolate dripping 🥵😂  the result was amazing. I also added a bit of vanilla flavour. I already selected the next slice I'll have tomorrow after workout 😂 Great job, needed this these Days. thank you 🙏👊
7727	986	I remember my grandma & mom making it & they are both gone now. And I'm sick and wanted some so I made it. Thanks for the recipe & reminding me of such good memories.
7728	986	Yummy reminded me of my momsEveryone ate it up fast n was gone.. lol will make again!!
7729	986	Use whipped cream instead of sour cream
7730	986	Easy to make and can be preparedseveral days in advance. I had unsweetened coconut on hand so I added sugar, only a few spoons. My in-laws like to add chopped walnuts and sometimes vanilla extract. Mix the sour cream and coconut together first and gently mix in the remaining ingredients. So easy to put together and put in the fridge several days before serving just add the marshmallows last, 24 hours before serving.  I will make again. Not everyone will love this recipe but I enjoyed it.
7731	986	What a great find!  Mom use to make this for Thanksgiving and I thought we lost this one with her.  I was thinking about what the 'sauce' was and decided to look it up.  We omit the coconut, but this was right on.  What a great childhood memory!
7732	986	Yummy! Definitely need to make in advance. Much better when you let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. I added pecans (1 cup) and a little less sour cream. So delicious. As stated prior, be sure to drain the fruit well. So good with the pecans added!
7733	986	Simple, nostalgic dish. I tossed in a handful of chopped walnuts.
7734	986	We have been making this salad for as long as I can remember. We add cut up banana pieces, use crushed pineapple instead of chunk pineapple and omit the coconut.  You have to make it 24 hours before you eat it to allow flavors to meld.  So delicious!!  Easy - peasy.
7735	986	Exactly like I always make.  Very good and so easy
7736	987	Wow! This blend of flavors is incredible.  I did not have whole milk, so used almond milk instead.  I also used 2/3 of the recipe, as I only had one can of coconut milk, which was only 2 cups, but ended up adding the full amount of rice (regular long grain rice) in order to absorb all the liquids. I tossed everything except the rice and peaches into a saucepan and stirred until the butter melted, added the peaches and rice, then let it sit for about a half hour.  Finished it off for 2 minutes in the microwave to further absorb the liquid.  It is delicious!
7737	987	I like the idea of this recipe. It should have been really good. But the butter, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar all need to be cut in half for my tastes. It was way too sweet for me. It was very creamy, and the peaches are a nice addition.
7738	987	This is a creamy and delicious pudding. I followed the recipe as stated except for three things: used 3/4 c white sugar (which may be as sweet as 1-1/2 c raw sugar..I don't know), added two handfuls of raisins  when adding the eggs and milk, and finally sprinkled the cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg  to individual servings.  There are many comments about changes other cooks have  done with success. I enjoy this dessert!!  Light, not too rich, and  while warm, I couldn't leave it alone. Yum!
7739	987	Yum! This turned out pretty well, although I did follow the advice of others and cut the sugar by half. Even then it was a touch on the sweet side. Also, I cut back on the spices. To be honest, I think I liked it best just before adding the spices. The next time I make it I will just sprinkle cinnamon on the portions of people who want it. Finally, I found that after 18 minutes, my rice was not yet the right texture. I dumped in some more milk and cooked it for another ten minutes. That was the right amount of time for my rice to become the perfect texture.
7740	987	Cut sugar (white) in half, omitted nutmeg (just a matter of personal taste) and added just diced, drained mango from the can. Came out delicious, my kids couldn't eat it fast enough!!
7741	987	I used half the sugar and half coconut oil/butter to equal the butter.
7742	987	Very tasty, but as others have said, 1.5c of sugar seemed like a lot for 3 cups of rice. Others have said they cut the sugar in half, but I thought maybe that was overkill, so I cut down to 1c, which is cutting by 1/3.  And that was 3/4 cup turbinado sugar with 1/4c white sugar, because I thought I might not care for all turbinado.  It's borderline too sweet, so next time I make it I'll indeed cut back to 3/4c.  Also, a quarter-cup of butter seemed like a lot, so I used only 3T and it tastes fine.
7743	987	Very good flavor, except it didn’t set up like a pudding after chilling it.  The consistency was loose. I agree with others that the sugar could be reduced. Also, for aesthetics, I like my rice pudding to look white and then add cinnamon on top. Adding vanilla, cinnamon makes the pudding turn brown.
7744	987	I made this for my family and  they LOVED IT!!!! I do t even like rice pudding and I like it ALOT!!!!
7745	673	Loved it added more coconut and nuts and let the mango sit to create juice just to give it a better mango flavor. It’s delicious
7746	673	My family loved his bread. I’ve made it multiple times. The second time used extra large eggs and I doubled the coconut and it was perfect. I also melted the butter and then let it cool.  The flavor depends on the quality of the mangoes.
7747	673	Yum!  Our neighbor keeps giving us mangoes, so I keep making this bread!  I doubled it, and used 1 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, and I added two bananas to it.  Maybe next time I'll only add 3/4 cup white sugar; it was pretty sweet!  Very delicious!
7748	673	This was so moist and tasty.I used one 8x4x2 pan and two small ones, the small ones got done 10 minutes sooner than the larger pan. I followed the re pie as is.
7749	673	No leftovers. A good sign as any that says the recipe for this mango bread works. Thanks for sharing.Next time may tweak this recipe with some suggestions by commenters.
7750	673	This is my husband’s and my favorite. My wonderful neighbor would supply the mangos and I made bread for his family as well. Here are some adjustments I have made: Butter - 1/2 cup +1/4 cup coconut oilSugar-2/3 cup brown and 2/3 cup whiteUse unsweetened coconut.
7751	673	I used almond cassava flour blend and organic cane sugar 😍
7752	673	A friend called this the best mango bread she has ever eaten. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out. There are walnut haters in my household so I left the nuts out. The honey mango and coconut alone tasted great. I made these into mango muffins and cooked for about 25 minutes at altitude. Another friend asked me to make this again soon and I just might.
7755	989	Perfect snack or dessert, as mentioned.  I ate chewy rice flour and coconut confections as a child and this recipe fits the bill.Husband also developed a gluten sensitivity to this treat is a welcome addition to what he can enjoy.Instead of baking in a large pan, I halved the recipe and baked in three smaller square pans.  Baked in half the time and enjoyed them sooner!
7756	989	Decent recipe but disappointed after baking on a sheet pan as directed, as the bibingka turned out much too thin. Tried the recipe again in a 13 x 9 pan and it yielded a much better (and albeit more traditional) result.
7757	989	The first time I made this,  I only had one jar of macapuno.  It was good, but it came a tad dry.  For this 2nd attempt, I had 2 jars of macapuno.  It turned our perfect, but is a tad too sweet for my liking.  I will likely reduce the brown sugar by 1/2 next time.
7758	989	This was very good and texture came out perfect.  I followed the recipe as written except reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup because I was worried it was going to be too sweet with the macapuno strings.  Also lined the pan for easy clean up.  Thanks for sharing!
7759	990	I made it twice. Cut the recipe in half. Use only 1 cup of sugar. Use a 8x8 baking pan lined with parchment paper.  Use half cup of sweet coconut flake in the final stir, I added3/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  Blended well and only use 2 eggs.  After pouring in pan take 4-5 tablespoons of shredded coconut and lightly sprinkle over top of mixture. What they don't tell you is this is a butter rich greasy cake, when it cooks the butter seem to float to the top, sides and bottom. Set oven 350. 45 to 50 minutes check for a nice golden brown. Then let cool in the open shut off oven for at least 30 minutes or more.  Use a sharp knife and cut into the picture pieces, more semi crunchy chewy crust hint of almond taste of coconut and real uwee gooeey mochi texture and taste. Can store in airtight container (do not put in fridge) for 2 days if it last that long.OISHI
7760	990	Loved this recipe I used the rice flour but I put pineapple in mine turned out good it looks burned along the sides but it’s not I will make this again
7761	990	YUM!!! I actually made this in my AIR FRYER last night and it was SO good and successful! I used the 3 serving recipe, just one egg, no shredded coconut, and 1% milk. At first I baked at the regular 350 degrees for about 10 minutes then decided to switch to 325. The top was dark but didn't taste burnt at all, the sides had a slight crispiness and overall it was just DELICIOUS. My boyfriend loved it too and he's not big on sweets. I'm going to make another batch today since I just finished the last bite and it just wasn't enough! :P I loved it so much I made an account just to write a review LOL thank you for the great recipe!
7762	990	This is a great recipe for mochi cake. My mother in law is from Kauai and this is just like hers. It’s easy to make, tastes onolicious, and is great to bring for potluck or a bake sale!
7763	990	OMG its sooo good, I used the Mochiko sweet rice flour, doubled the coconut and followed the tip about substituting the milk for evaporated milk, sea salt and coconut milk. Baked for only 50 minutes. Its perfect!
7764	990	I made changes as one of the reviewer, replacing 3 cups of milk with coconut milk and evaporated milk to make up 3 cups. And cut the sugar to 2 cups and add 1 tsp of salt since I used unsalted butter.
7765	990	instead of 3 cups milk, i used 1.5 of milk and 1.5 of coconut milk (if you can find Chaokoh brand, use that!). I also only used 2 cups of sugar (raw Florida Crystals), and it was plenty sweet! I make mine with whatever glutinous rice flour is cheapest and Mochiko isn't always it! I love how the sugar rises to the top and makes a crunchy crust! Bake this the full hour in the 9x13 pan, and let cool completely before cutting. Better the 2nd and 3rd day. Broke da mouth.
7766	990	This recipe is better than other mochi recipes that I've tried. I substituted the milk with 1 can of evaporated and 1 can of coconut milk. I also cut the sugar in half and added macapuno strings instead of coconut flakes. PERFECT! Its my go-to recipe for family gatherings.
7767	990	Great recipe and crowd favorite! I will
7768	991	I added extra chocolate and coconut to the mix. So, so good!
7769	991	Easy, delicious no-bake cookies. I swapped 1 tbsp of coffee for 1 tbsp. Creme de Cacao liquor, and halved the recipe.
7770	991	Made this twice! Kids love it. Did not use any sugar or coffee, these are for kids after all! Use a healthy dollop of honey as a natural sweetener. I rolled some in shredded coconut and another batch in chopped cashew for some texture.
7771	991	I  was born in Sweden and let me tell you that these are the must have for holidays,everydays,some days etc... but have you ever tried pearl sugar? it is a must have for these. You roll them in pearl sugar instead of coconut. It balances out the dark coffee and chocolate flavor with a sweet crunch!
7772	991	Good moisture. I'm glad that they made something Swedish. I have a love for the gorgeous country, and it's reassuring that someone remembered it. The chocolate balls are identical to the ones in Sweden.
7773	991	yummy - but I'm a bit confused. I used a food processor to chop the oats fine, added the sugar, cocoa, and 1/3 c coconut (to hide from family that claim not to like it). When I added the other ingredients, it was not doughy. So I added more coffee. And more coffee. I'm guessing I added about 1/2c coffee until it became doughy. It easily scooped with a melon baller. Strangely, while we all liked them, none of us thought it tasted much like coffee. Again - yummy! but if you are wanting a lovely chocolate-coffee taste, then you need REALLY STRONG coffee (or use instant, as one person suggested).
7774	991	These were great and super easy! The oats I got were like Red Mill super chunky so I ended up adding 1/2 c. flour to get the dough to stick together better, but that's probably my fault. My daughter hates chocolate (I know, right?!!) so I modified the recipe and made half of them with butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, and a teaspoon of cinnamon. They are also super delicious!! I can't believe I've never heard of these before, my great grandparents are FROM SWEDEN.
7775	991	I took out some of the things that i havent used before
7776	991	This recipe is absolutely amazing! Everyone who tried one loved it. I've made this recipe a lot because it is just the best. I didn't have any coconut on hand when I made these though but they were still absolutely amazing!
7805	995	You will have to adjust some things with this recipe. It’s better to ban it in a cupcake tray so it will rise and come out like buns. It will flatten on a flat tray. You can use 1 egg instead of 2 and put as much coconut as you want! Don’t be shy! You can add nuts or dried fruits as well if you like.
7806	995	I think the butter measurements  is wrong. I followed the ingredients and instructions and it came out flat. Ended up looking like coconut cake instead of buns .
7867	1002	Turned out great will make again soon! I only switched lime for lemon because I had limes but 😋 mmmm
7777	992	I have been making this recipe for 30 plus years. Looked all over Allrecipes at different variations and found lots of  "German" chocolate cakes that quite frankly should just be called a Chocolate cakes. So I decided to go back to the original recipe. Glad I did! The last time i had made this was in 2019 at my Mom's request for her 89th birthday.  It has been a while and I was at her house with her baking pans and she greased and floured them. So please take note, it is somewhat of a fragile layer so Grease, flour and parchment and spray parchment and cocoa the top. That time it came out in so many pieces we had to glue it back together with the amazing  frosting laughing all the time, no one suspected it was so broken. So lesson learned last night i made it again and OMG no wonder it has stayed in my mind as one of my most favorite. No corners cut it is absolutely  moist, light, and delicious. Worh the effort
7778	992	The only change made was I doubled the icing!! This is a BIG family favorite!!!
7779	992	So moist and so fluffy. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. Only addition was the fudge frosting. Trust me, the work is worth it.
7780	992	Second year making this cake. Had heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, also used the buttermilk powder to make a cup of buttermilk.Might in the future try chocolate buttercream on the sides, but it's perfect like this!
7781	992	Taste is delicious but I didn't have enough icing. I had to make another recipe to even cover the top layer.
7782	992	Easy to make and delicious
7783	992	I made this for my son’s birthday.  And The cake is absolutely yummy!!  It crumbles easy but I am not a baker and I could have over mixed or something.  But it was very moist and not too sweet!!  The frosting was barely enough to cover the three layers but that was ok by me for it was just enough sweetness.  If I make again I Will double  the frosting for to be sure each layer was fully covered and more for sides.  But definitely making it again!
7784	992	This was a great cake to make from scratch.  I also think more chocolate would be good but I added pieces of moist chocolate brownie to add chocolate.   The icing is to die for.  But a tip for some maybe is “cook the icing for the exact time in medium after bringing it to a boil.  I freeze my cakes in order to ice them as it helps to keep them firm while decorating.  With a warm icing it cools it quickly so it doesn’t slide off.  I noticed in some pictures this happened.  I put the icing into a cool bowl; beat it with electric beater and then onto cake.  Worked beautifully.   I made a 9x11x2 cake (x2) plus doubled icing and still didn’t have enough for the sides.  I used chocolate ganache for layers.  I’d triple the icing to ensure the cake is covered.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I’ll use it again (making my own adjustments to make it mine … 😂).
7785	992	Made this cake for my BFs birthday and it was hands down THE best cake I've ever had. Ran out of frosting and had to use a can of chocolate for the sides, so be prepared.
7786	993	Do not make this as a tube or bundt cake. The cake isn’t bad, but is dry. It’s very fluffy but will benefit from frosting. I’d make this as a layer cake with frosting next time. And that’s after including many of the suggestions made in the reviews.
7787	993	Yum! i just made and enjoyed some of this cake. i had dissected (unsweetened) coconut that I post with about 3 tablespoons of olive oil as per another suggestion. The only other change I made was I use 2 1/2 cups of sugar. My cake is super moist. I cooked it for the time it called for, then turned off the oven and left it for another 15 to 17 minutes. Thanks for this recipe.
7788	993	The taste of this cake is pretty nice but it’s too dry. I reduced the flour and even added some milk hoping to avoid a dry cake (based on the reviews) but it was still dry. Very disappointed. It’s definitely not worth the time making it again.
7789	993	It tasted great  and looked nice but mine over baked and was quite  dry and crumbly once sliced.   After 1 hr and 10 minutes it was VERY done in my oven. I wish I had checked it sooner.
7790	993	The pound cake was just satisfactory. It was too poundy and was in need of more creme. Otherwise, the coconut flavours worked really well. In the future, i would recommend including mayonnaise into the wet ingredients to ensure the moisture stays present.
7791	993	It wasn’t instantly dry but after the first 24 is did crumble more than expected. Had some grilled in a pan with butter to help finish the rest of it off. Other than that I enjoyed the flavor.
7792	993	I made this and did what a few others suggested.  I added an extra 1/2 teasp. of coconut extract, 1/2 cup less sugar, and made sure I beat the butter, cream cheese, & sugar until it was fluffy & added one egg at a time.  It was delicious!!!
7793	993	I used 2.5 cup of sugar still sweet will decrease sugar to 2 cups I also used unsweetened coconut  , did not like texture flavor . Cake very heavy I will make next week with cake flour. There was so much batter  for a regular Bundt pan.
7794	993	I made this cake but with a couple of the changes suggested by other reviewers. I added an extra stick of butter and cut the sugar by a half cup. I baked it in a 13 x 9 pan because I don’t have great luck with bundt cakes-dark edges or not coming out of the pan without breaking. I started baking it for 30 minutes and then testing every 2 minutes after for maybe 10-12 more minutes. I found the cake dry and crumbly so not sure what the answer is-also add canola or vegetable oil? It had a really good flavor but the texture bothered me. Maybe I cooked it too long but the middle still seemed jiggly so I’d leave it in for a couple more minutes.
7795	994	Wow!!!! These are the best cookies ever!! The only change I made was I boiled the sugar mixture slightly longer, about 2 and a half minutes, as I like a solid consistency and less runny. They turned out perfectly!
7796	994	Too much sugar. Very sweet
7797	994	So easy! Always a favorite! I left out the coconut and added more oatmeal.
7798	994	11.27.21  My husband is the chocolate fan in this house, and all I could  hear when he bit into the cookie was y-u-m-m-m-m-m!  Hard to believe you can get this kind of chocolate flavor with just cocoa powder.  And so easy to make, as well.  This one’s a keeper.
7799	994	Easy to make. Quick and easy.
7800	994	Added extra half cup of oats
7801	994	I left out coconut
7802	994	Easy & delicious!! Perfect for a chocolate snack craving!! Hubby couldn’t stop eating them!! Lol
7803	994	Simple to make and oh so good!
7804	995	I don't understand the ratings being so high when the recipe is so far off. I was excited to find an authentic "Guyanese" Coconut Bun recipe to make for my Guyanese BF and was horribly embarrassed when they came out flat as pancakes - and in only 1/2 the recommended cooking time.
7833	999	Huge hit in my house.....absolutely loved them.  Aside from leaving out the walnuts, I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Will be making more at the weekend.
7807	995	They are delicious. They are a little softer than I'm used too but they taste great. We call this coconut drop where I live.  I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and used 2 cups of shredded coconut which helps enhance  the coconut flavor and thicken the consistency of the batter. I also left out the eggs and used extra milk instead. Hubby an father-in-law approved!
7808	995	Taste great. I would just add another 1/2 cup of sugar.
7809	995	DELICIOUS! !
7810	995	Good recipe but needs adjustment for GREAT recipe.  First, the combined liquid of 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk and the extracts is way too much.  This results in pancake-like buns.  I used 1 egg, 1/4 cup COCONUT milk and the extracts instead.  Even this adjusted amount may still be too much.  Add just enough of the combined liquid only until mixture comes together to form a biscotti-like dough.  I used 1-1/4 cups of sweetened coconut flakes and 1 cup currants as well.  Drop tablespoons of the dough on parchment-lined cookie sheets (do not compact) and press in 3-5 halved macadamia nuts on top.  Bake as directed until tops are golden brown.  You will not be disappointed!
7811	995	I haven't tried this recipie but I also make coconut buns. When making this recipie people shouldn't be afraid to add extra coconut or dried raisins or cranberrys. I'm sure this is a delicious recipies and perhaps I'll try it soon.
7812	995	I just made the recipe, but did use coconut milk and coconut extract in place of the almond.  The flavor is great, but they came out flat as a pancake.  I also put some in a cupcake pan, so now I guess you can call them a muffin in place of bun.  Not sure about the reaction between baking powder & coconut milk -- will try again.  from Foodie
7813	996	It brought back memories and taste just like how I remembered it.
7814	997	Oh wow, this is good! I made my own birthday cake with a pineapple upside down cake, cake mix. I like sponge/angel food cake so I whipped 5 egg whites and added it to the cake batter at the end before I made this coconut-cream cheese frosting. Like some others, I didn't add as much confectioner's sugar and instead of coconut cream, I added Spiced Rum. I had made some whipped cream for the filling and added a couple of tablespoons of it to the frosting at the end. The consistency was very fluffy and one of the easiest frosts I've ever done! It kept its consistency on the cooled cake layers. Dusted the top with toasted coconut and it was beautiful! I love my birthday cake!
7815	997	One thing to remember is to put this on a cold cake ..if you don't it will end up melting down the side.
7816	997	This turned out beautifully, and as other reviewers mentioned, it’s flexibility allows you to work your own touch to it. I don’t believe I used a full four cups of powdered sugar, I just added til it looked thick and smooth.
7817	997	This is good as is, but we added a few tablespoons of cocoa powder to it and it was next level!
7818	997	Amazing flavor and consistency. Love the extra twang the sour cream adds. I paid mine with strawberry cake for baby shower cupcakes! Huge hit!
7819	997	Loved it, and it hasn't even gone on my cake yet.  I didn't have any cream, so I used orange juice, instead, and I used one teaspoon each of vanilla, orange, and coconut flavoring.  This will go on a pound cake having all the same flavors-if there is any left after the cake comes out of the oven.
7820	997	No
7821	997	perfect match for the gluten free cake
7822	997	Delicious! Perfect consistency & great taste, didn’t have to tweak it at all. I topped it with toasted coconut & pecans - yummy!
7823	998	I made this exactly as printed.  I think it should have had 2 cups of oatmeal rather than the 1 as printed.  It spread all over the pan and was a mess.   I may save it to put over apple pie or ice cream.  Other recipes for these cooks have 2 cups of oatmeal listed.
7824	998	I made these to bring to a graduation party for my friends son who was moving to Australia with his Aussie girlfriend . I had never met her and wanted to make something thematic. I had never heard of these cookie/biscuits. After reading the reviews I was determined to make these as authentically as possible -- a big part of that seemed to be using the "golden syrup". Unfortunately, I was limited with time and the store I had a moment to get to didn't have it. So I went with what a Google search told me was a same/same sub of honey. I also read the cooking time reviews here and settled on 10 minutes. These  Hail Mary choices  paid off and passed the taste test of not only the Aussie, but a Kiwi too! Highly recommend. Thank you for all the helpful reviews!
7825	998	I ended up making these for an Australian-themed pot luck. I had never tried them before or heard of them before Googling Australian recipes, but I have to say that these cookies were delicious. I ended up ordering the golden syrup from an online retailer because I wasn’t sure I’d be able to find it locally, which worked out just fine.I did read through the reviews before making these, and I’m glad I did, because I flattened the cookies before baking with the bottom of a measuring cup and only baked them for 10 minutes, and I feel they were perfect. They were slightly crispy around the edges and softer in the center, but not too soft. They didn’t crumble apart or anything. I think if I’d cooked them the full time, the bottoms and edges might have gotten too browned.
7826	998	I made this and it was delicious! You can substitute golden syrup with honey or molasses.
7827	998	I made these just as the recipe is written, no changes at all. Sorry, but I did not care for the taste or texture. I won't be making again.
7828	998	Very delicious! If you like coconut and oats, this is a keeper. Very easy cookie to make. I did cut down on the sugar to 1/2 cup, made the golden syrup which turned out to be very thick; I boiled it too long. I had to heat the spoon to scoop some out. LOL! After that it was easy. I added 1 Tbsp of hot water because it was too crumbly and dry, used OF oats instead of the quick ones. My bake time was 11-14 minutes.
7829	998	These are delicious and easy! I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the pan of syrup mixture, added a nice flavor. I also only cooked them for 10 minutes and they were a moist cookie. I will definitely make them again!
7830	998	Loved these cookies!  Easy and very popular with everyone in my family!
7831	998	I made these yesterday reducing the sugar down to 3/4 c and I used unsweetened coconut.  I used a small cookie scoop, baked them for 9-10  minutes. When they were warm they were crunchy soft. When they were cooled they were crunchy chewy. YUMMO!!!!  They are now on the fave list  ...Thank you Sharon.
7832	999	These were very good. I read several reviews before making them. I used craisins for the fresh cranberries. I added 1/2 tsp. Each of allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. Since some reviewers thought the cookies retained too much moisture  the next day or two, I left the cookies in the oven 2-3 minutes longer than I usually do for a drop cookie. Finally I finished the cookies off with an orange glaze. This is definitely a recipe I will be using often.
7834	999	This recipe was easy to make and turned out really well.  I didn't put in orange zest or walnuts though.  I am 9 years old and I found this recipe then told my dad I was going to make it, so I did!  I am totally going to be making this again soon!
7835	999	I didn't add the walnuts and I didn't miss them. I also changed the spices to a pumpkin pie spice that I had on hand. So good!
7836	999	This is a soft cake like cookie.  If you love cranberries as much as I do, you'll love this recipe.  I added about 1/2c additional fresh cranberries.  Just wonderful.  They were a big hit at the cookie exchange at work!!
7837	999	delicious and easy
7838	999	Worked well. Made two batches, one with cruising and one with fresh cranberries. Also subbed pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  Both were great.
7839	999	Substitute dark choc for walnut. After baking for 10 minutes, I put it in an hot air dryer at 70c for an hour to get rid of some moisture. It’s fantastic.
7840	999	I made these tonight,  or at least a version thereof. I used 2 1/2 yrs. expired Crisco (down to last stick of butter), used 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 sugar,  1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, didn't measure the pumpkin,  used frozen cranberries instead of fresh, lemon zest instead of orange.  Remembered I had oranges,  then put the orange zest in there, and didn't grease the pan because I  missed that step.#Quarantinecooking2020.  Turns out they were great!  Can't imagine how fabulous they would have been if I had made them like the recipe said!!
7841	1000	Ridiculously too much topping. I've made this about 5 times now. I've cut the sugar in the muffins to 1/2 cup and the entire topping to 2T white sugar, 1.5 Tbs flour, 1 Tbs cubed butter, and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. Much better.
7842	1000	I made these muffins (6 large) and they are delicious. Followed the recipe almost to the letter, but I replaced milk with 1/3 cup sour cream and baked at 350* for 30 minutes. I find sour cream give muffins a nice moist texture. I would recommend this recipe.
7843	1000	Love this recipe.
7844	1000	I gave the recipe as is 4 stars.  It was my go to recipe for a few years, but I felt it could be improved because the muffin lacks flavor.I don't have access to fresh blueberries, so I adapted the flour and baking powder proportions to compensate for my impatience as I toss in two cups of mostly frozen berries into the batter.  This makes 12 small muffins.  The explosion of blueberries and the subtle vanilla butter make the topping overkill, so I sprinkle a tiny bit of raw sugar on top before baking.The following changes really make these to die for muffins, especially adding dried lavender.1 2/3 cups all-purpose flour¾ cup light brown sugar2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt⅓ cup melted butter1 teaspoon vanilla (added to melted butter before mixing)1 egg1 teaspoon cinnamon OR lavender flowers⅓ cup milk, with one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar2 cups frozen blueberriesEnjoy!
7845	1000	These were so easy to make.  They are amazing.
7846	1000	Absolutely the best. Everyone loves them.  Many compliments including asking me the name of the bakery where I got them.
7847	1000	First time making these and they turned out great!  With fresh Blueberries and add extra milk to batter.  Husband and friends loved them
7848	1000	Amazing. Moist and the topping is so good. I made according to recipe  (a little less sugar than called for - i don't things too sweet) and they came out perfect.
7849	1000	So good, my friend and I made them and the crumble on the top makes them all the more better
7850	298	Amazing! I wanted a fruit salad without it tasting like a dessert.  This is PERFECT! Thank you for sharing!
7851	298	Liked this fruit salad very much. The sauce blended all the fruit nicely yet you still tasted each fruit. I started layering the fruits but when I added the sauce I mixed it all up. Not sure why you need to wait 2-3 hours before serving. The bananas did get a little mushy after a couple hours out on the counter. Still had great flavor. The sauce never did thicken though I cooked it for 10+ minutes, but still tasted good.  I liked the way all the fruits tasted like they belonged.
7852	298	We prepared this fruit salad for a small party that we held this week. It was a huge hit and better than even we thought that it would be. Definitely worth the 5*.I tried to stick very much to the recipe for this time, with the only exception being that I added 5 kiwi fruits since that was what the container I purchased held and I didn't want to waste the other 2. I actually thought that the 5 fruits was a perfect quantity and, after looking at it, that 3 might be a little light, to be honest.I wouldn't change a thing, to be honest, and plan on making this again when future activities call for it. The only negative was that the blueberries that I purchased were a little more sour than I would have liked but that is no fault of the salad. Overall, two thumbs up from ourselves and everyone that we served it to.
7853	298	It was great. I may change it up next time but for now, perfect.
7854	298	My family loved it. Didn’t change a thing.
7855	298	Excellent. Dressing was very good.
7856	298	I did not make any changes. Made it exactly as the recipe called for. It was easy to make and everyone loved the taste. I will make it again
7857	298	I love this recipe! The sauce is amazing. I have been making it for the 4th of July and it has become a repeat request dish for me to bring! Thank you!!
7858	298	Fabulous salad. Good for you too
7859	1002	The large amount of sugar in jam recipes acts as a preservative. PLEASE, those of you who decided to add less sugar, check your jars after opening for any signs of spoilage. Great recipe here, by the way
7860	1002	This was my first time making this jam and was so easy and it taste great . I give it 5  stars ⭐️
7861	1002	Great recipe and great jam.
7862	1002	This doesn't make jam, it makes syrup.  Boiled longer than recommended and it never set up.  I'll use pectin from now on.
7863	1002	Not sure what is happening but, I let mine cook and cook and cook and it's still runny.Between steps 2 and 3, you should really put on there whether or not to have turn the heat off and let it sit for those 10 to 15 minutes, also.
7864	1002	Just got out of the kitchen.  Made 10 4oz jars (double batch).  The frozen spoon method mentioned earlier works great.  Based on other recommendations, I only used 3 cups sugar.  It was still pretty sweet.  I will definitely cut back to 2.5 or 2 next time.
7865	1002	Jams and jellies take far more sugar than one would expect.  Changing the ratio of sugar to fruit will afffect the outcome, so be careful when changing a recipe.  (My grandmother's recipe was also equal amounts of fruit and sugar.) Also, if you are unsure about canning or don't have the equipment,  you can  freeze any jam that will not be used right away.  I have found that freezing doesn't affect flavor or consistency and is generally easier than canning.
7866	1002	this was amazing recipe
7868	1003	This is our old family recipe for pretzel salad that I had lost. Where I come from, this is a side dish not a dessert. The jello is mercurial. Occasionally it will not set firm and slide off. That's the perils of pretzel. But a covered dish or holiday meal isn't complete without it.
7869	1003	family loves it, might make minor changes later but great for now.
7870	1003	I've been making this for Christmas and/or Thanksgiving.  It has become a family tradition.  Because this recipe is so forgiving, you can adjust the recipe to your own taste.  The dessert is actually gorgeous when completed - especially on a serving plate.  Enjoy and Merry Christmas to everyone!!!!!!!!!
7871	1003	Love this!! A favorite of all the holidays!
7872	1003	This is a family favorite year after year!  It takes time and cannot be rushed.  You have to let the crust cool completely. The cream cheese mixture needs to sit in the fridge until it gets cold.  Then let the jello mixture thicken until it coats the back of a spoon before you pour it over the cold cream cheese mixture.  Sometimes it cuts beautifully, sometimes the jello falls off…I cannot figure that one out, but it does not change the taste.
7873	1003	The only thing I will modify for next time, is to incorporate maybe 1-2 layers of Vanilla Wafers. Adding that slightly light cake like touch to it without diminishing the overall taste. This was a very good recipe on its own.
7874	1003	We made whip cream from scratch and fresh strawberries.
7875	1003	These are really great directions to follow. I just love the flavor and texture of this treat, but I think I want to make it like some one mentioned with whipped cream in the strawberry part. For that one I will put into glasses like a parfait 🌞
7876	1003	Delish
7877	1004	I love this recipe.  It's easy and comes out perfect every time.  It's a  winner!
7878	1004	Very easy recipe and very good! Made it last night and there's only I slice left! First time making a blueberry pie!
7879	1004	I have made this pie several times, always comes out amazing!
7880	1004	I loved the pie it was delicious. I followedthe recipe except I didn’t bother with the lattice top. I also heated the blueberry mixture just enough to thaw my freshly frozen blueberries as this was a spur of the moment decision.
7881	1004	Just made this for Christmas Eve, and it was a hit with everyone! I followed this recipe down to a tee, but one change that I made that I absolutely recommend is adding lemon juice. It does a phenomenal job of bringing out the flavor of the blueberries, and the pie has a nice tangy and tart taste as a result.I squeezed the juice of at least one lemon and strained the juice with a sieve. After the dry ingredients are mixed in with the blueberries, I poured in two tablespoons of the lemon juice into the mixture and folded it all in with a rubber spatula. Then I left it to set for at least an hour (the longer the better) before baking as directed to have the blueberries absorb all of the flavors.I hope this helps!
7882	1004	This came out perfect.   I preheated my oven with a drip pan, and reduced to 375 as soon as I put the pie in,  thinking that would brown the bottom better, and it did.  I used just over 4 TB corn starch.   I substitute sugar with erythritol, 1 to 1 , and it tastes very natural and not too sweet.   It set beautifully and sliced well.  Will definitely keep this recipe .
7883	1004	Made this for the 1st time and it was a hit. But definitely tweaked it based other reviewers' suggestions.Used 5 cups of fresh blueberries instead of 4 cupsUsed 6 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of only 3 tbspsUsed 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. Was right mix of tart and sweetness (not too sweet)Cooked at 400 for 45 minutes. Edges did turn brown. Think next time, I'll try @ 375 degrees for 50 minutesI let it cool for several hours.
7884	1004	I like how easy this was, although I wish it mentioned somewhere to let the finished pie sit for a few (3 or 4) hours to let it congeal fully. I’m new to fruit pies/thickeners and didn’t know this: I got frustrated with the initial “runny”ness of it. I then read other blueberry pie recipes and learned such. PATIENCE with letting it cool/congeal. And I would use less sugar. A personal preference.
7885	1004	Loved it
7886	1005	I added about a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice & thickened with cornstarch mixture. It was perfect. The lemon juice was just what was needed with the sweetness.
7887	1005	Amazing easy to make. I made from frozen berries   Took a bit longer to cook down but still delicious.
7888	1005	It's my go to strawberry sauce recipe!
7889	1005	Made half batch as I am the only one going to be eating this.  I looked up the grams of a pint of strawberries and went with half of that.  I also did not blend this up as I prefer the chunks of strawberries.  This was perfect on top of my buttermilk pancakes.  Will definitely make again.
7890	1005	Hope I did good
7891	1005	This was delicious and dead easy!  I didn't have enough strawberries so I substituted with blueberries... Wow, the colour was beautiful and it tasted so good!
7892	1005	Had 2 big cups of fresh/frozen strawberries, so added a little more sugar than 1/3 c., & did add vanilla. Followed recipe & it was YUMMY! Super easy! Pretty too. Great for cheesecake, pancakes, ice-cream, biscuits, etc. Can't wait to try same recipe with some frozen organic deep red sweet cherries!
7893	1005	First, super easy! Second/first, it is delicious!Third, I recommend a whipped topping.Loved!
7894	1005	I followed the directions exactly, and it came out wonderfully.Its a keeper
7895	1006	It was wonderful, I followed the recipe as described.  Served it Christmas Eve.  Dusted the top with confectioners  sugar.  It is delicious and will make it again.
7896	1006	We made this without walnuts. My boyfriend says he'd prefer this without the almond extract. Maybe use vanilla or citrus extract instead?
7897	1006	This recipe was recommended by a friend who enjoyed it on Thanksgiving. I made it today and it is very tasty. Followed  the recipe as stated with the exception of adding 1 cup of walnuts rather than 1/2.  I ate it a few minutes out of the oven without ice cream or whipped cream- I don’t think it has to have either to be enjoyed. Would recommend this 100%.
7898	1006	So easy to make and cranberries are tart but batter is sweet so nice contrast.
7899	1006	One of my all-time very best favorites. I have made of several years for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've done the pie, made it in loaf pans, and as muffins. I took some to school last year and everyone was asking for the recipe. The almond extract may seem a bit odd to put with cranberries to some people, but to me that's what makes the whole thing. (I usually add a little extra).
7938	1010	Way too sweet and did not set. I cooked sauce until it was like jelly and even added a little agar. Still the pie is liquid after 12 hours of refrigeration. Something is wrong with this recipe.
7900	1006	I tried this out with and served it to two wonderful great cooks and bakers who loved it both as a dessert and the next morning with their cup of coffee. I read the reviews and adapted this to my liking.  I used 1-1/2 cups of frozen cranberries (I let them thaw and they were perfect-don't know why some are having such a hard time with them). I baked it up in my 9"cast iron pan to give it a great crisp "crust".  I also was debating between sprinkling it with coarse sugar or the brown sugar topping- I went for the brown topping.  It did need more time cooking to get it the way I like it nice and golden.  This is a great recipe as it is or with the adjustment-- it's so interchangeable as well.   EnJoY~
7901	1006	We call this Cranberry Crack at our house.I know you’re not supposed to “double” recipes but I’ve been making this as a double batch in a bar form, like brownies, for years.Double all of the ingredients and I substitute  pecans for walnuts. I love the flavor.Bake in a 9x13 pan lined with parchment.You will need to cook it longer until a toothpick comes out clean.After it is cut into squares do not put it in a tightly sealed container because it gets soggy.My daughter in law makes substitutions to make it dairy and gluten free. Still delicious.EVERYONE asks for this recipe!And I am requested to make it for every holiday!
7902	1006	This was more like a white cake with tart cranberries melted in, if you like that. It’s a coffee cake and not a pie. The almond didn’t lend a nutty flavor at all, but it helped. Not very complex. Quite boring. Don’t bring to Thanksgiving.
7903	1006	So very easy to make. Came out perfect. I did the same leaving out nuts and adding a few chocolate chips!   Looks so good. Have friends coming tonight. Will serve for dessert with vanilla ice cream. Yum!!
7904	8	Loved this! I used less apples and more cranberries, but basically kept the other ratios the same. I like it a little tart so it was perfect.
7905	8	My family and friends raved about this!!!  I had some frozen cranberries and could use them up. With apples in season worked out. The pecans added flavor and crunch. Friends requesting recipe!!
7906	8	Ha! I just noticed the recipe called for 2 pounds apples, not 2 like I did but it still was very good. Just a bit too much cinnamon for me (or maybe not enough apples)
7907	8	Loved it except for the pecans.  Next time, I'll leave those out.
7908	8	Delicious!! I had extra crans I needed to use up, so I roughly doubled the cranberries and halved the amount of apples used.
7909	8	Love, Love, Love!
7910	8	I liked the flavor of the sweet apples and tart cranberries. The crisp was too dry for my taste. I doubled the butter so it was crispy without being sandy dry.
7911	8	Just used a little less sugar for the crumb topping.   I used dried cranberries which worked well.   Delicious!!!
7912	8	Wonderful! This will be my go-to for crisps from now on!
7913	1008	I substituted honey for the sugar and pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.
7914	1008	So good I should have put more blueberries but super easy to make 10/10
7915	1008	I used 6 oz frozen yogurt and added a little cinnamon/sugar.  It was delish!
7916	1008	This is wonderful. Instead of sugar I added a couple tbs of Italian sweet cream creamer. Used almond extract and cinnamon.
7917	1008	I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and it taste great!
7918	1008	Yummy!  I substituted coconut milk and stevia instead and added 2 ice cubes, but left everything else the same.  It was delicious!
7919	1008	Even delicious without the yogurt! Also, a bit of cinnamon tastes good with it, too!
7920	1008	When I find a good smoothie recipe like this, I save it.  I’m a good cook but I often find less ingredients with right proportions can be perfect.  This is.  Sweeter than my smoothies but my daughter gives it ten stars!
7921	1008	Awesome smoothie!! The whole family loves it too!
7922	1009	Just made this in 9x13 pan and feel it could be done in a 11x7 dish.  I did cut brown sugar in half and was plenty sweet.  I would start checking it at 30-40 minutes.  I took it out at 37 minutes and it was a little too done.
7923	1009	Delicious! This is now my go-to baked oatmeal recipe, especially since it doesn’t have flour. Due to food allergies, I made it vegan with flax eggs and oat milk, and canola oil instead of butter. It is delicious with blueberries instead of cranberries, too.
7924	1009	I love this recipe and have made it many times. One time I accidentally added an egg and we realized we actually prefer the recipe with 3 eggs so we make it that way now.
7925	1009	This is so simple but yet so good! 10/10 would recommend! I did not use cranberries but it was still a hit!
7926	1009	Omg!! I used my healthier ingredients. Coconut milk, swerve brown sugar, organic ingredients. Thus recipe did not disappoint!! I've shared it with two close friends.
7927	1009	easy recipe, my pan was slightly smaller than 9x13 and it fit well. it was too sweet though, next time i think 1/2 cup brown sugar would suffice. this is now in my “saved recipes”
7928	1009	Having lived in southern Lancaster County for a number of years, my husband and I are very particular about genuine baked oatmeal. This one is the real deal. Love using dried cranberries, but will try substituting apples next time. I halved the recipe for the two of us.
7929	1009	This is delicious! It’s not bars, and it’s not a bowl of oatmeal but somewhere in between. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and wil probably do 1/2 cup next time, but then I sprinkled some mini chips on top. Spoon into a bowl and enjoy!
7930	1009	This was great! Next time, I'm going to try it with apples.
7931	1010	Added about 1/4 of a teaspoon of lemon juice to it at the end to make it more tart. Was delicious
7932	1010	I uses a graham cracker crust .
7933	1010	Really good pie. Everyone enjoyed it!
7934	1010	The only thing I did differently is add 3/4 of orange juice instead of water and half the amount of sugar. Everyone loved it!
7935	1010	Simple. Easy!  Delicious!
7936	1010	I used more strawberries than indicated and I followed the recommendation of one review and lined my baked pie shell with melted semi sweet chocolate morsels, melted.  I found the pie filling a bit too sweet; may put a little less sugar next time.  Overall, a wonderful, easy recipe I'll surely make again.
7937	1010	I followed the tips from ShellyBerry dated 6-19-2006 and it worked out beautifully."......use more berries (1 1/2 qts.) and less water (only 1/2 cup). You crush 1 cup worth of berries and add the water to that. Mix the sugar and cornstarch together (will blend much better) and then bring the whole thing to a boil. Let it boil for 2 minutes until thick and translucent. Add 1 tbs. butter and let it cool before adding to the crust."Worked like a charm.
7939	1010	This was such a simple recipe to follow and was simply delicious. This will be one of our go to’s this summer.
7940	1011	Absolutely loved it! Followed the recipe exactly, I had never made a blackberry pie and this one was great! Wasn’t runny, but was nice and juicy! My husband loved it! ❤️
7941	1011	Turned out wonderfully! I used only 1T milk on top, and did add some lemon juice & 1/2 t ground ginger. Only used 1/8 c sugar on top. Awesome pie! Gone in 2 days with just 3 of us.
7942	1011	I tried this very simple recipe last night. Even us Aussie blokes can follow it.  Tasted delicious - my wife said so too! I had 3 serves.
7943	1011	Very easy recipe. I used frozen blackberries and it came out wonderful. The ice cream on top really made it extra delicious. I followed recipe as it was written. Will definitely make again!
7944	1011	It was so easy and delish!
7945	1011	Quite delicious. Everyone loved it. I did use store bought refrigerate pie crust due to time and where I assembled/baked it. I baked it Sunday for a Monday afternoon event. It was pleasantly slightly runny. If you like berry pie you can cut and serve neatly you will need more flour. I only baked an hour till the pie crust was done and bubbly center. I'd advise on pie crust cover first half of baking. Could have been my sister's oven though... who knows.
7946	1011	I did a cinnamon/sugar sprinkle on the top crust.  I also added a Tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to the Blackberry/Flour/Sugar mix to add a little tartness to it.  I am a hero dad in my house now!  Did I say that I also picked the berries myself!?
7947	1011	I added all but about 1/8 cup of sugar to the berries and  as suggested by a few, I added 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, and a scant 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  I also mixed all the blackberries with the flour and sugar. Only 1 Tablespoon or less of milk is needed to brush on top.
7948	1011	was great my 4 and 6 year old's helped
7949	1012	FABULOUS! My go to on every family event.  They love it.
7950	1012	It was great.
7951	1012	Very easy and delicious! I made this recipe with sugar substitute (I’m diabetic and in renal failure). It was great and was perfect for freezing (I made it last year and I will be making it again today).
7952	1012	I added finally chopped pecans And some cranberry jello powder
7953	1012	This was my first time making cranberry relish, I liked the flavor, and the recipe came together in no time at all.
7954	1012	I actually make this recipe once cranberries are available! Sept-mid Jan is the typical season for cranberries. I add chunks of the orange too! I do some with cinnamon and some without, depends on the dish.Favorite side dish with pork (my favorite), turkey, chicken and ham!  It accents the flavor of the meat.  Even my grandkids love it!This year I plan on freezing a bunch for spring/summer use.
7955	1012	Delicious!
7956	1012	I also included a small Pink Lady apple (trying to use up my apples) and a pinch of allspice.  It was delicious!
7957	1012	We love this relish - so easy & so yummy.  We'll have it for Christmas with ham, as well as Thanksgiving with turkey.  Very versatile .
7958	1013	I've made this 4 years in a row for Christmas brunch. Half strawberry and half blueberry. I love how I can make it the night before and then just pop it in the oven. Everyone loves it!
7959	1013	It was delicious but I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and honestly, it was sweet enough, I have not made it with 1 cup of sugar so I can't compare but with all the other ingredients, it was perfectly sweet.
7960	1013	This is the second time I am making it. My family loved loved this for breakfast, lunch and anytime they felt hungry for a treat.  I made  it with  blueberries and Italian bread but today I made it with  challah bread and sweet  black grapes. Next time I’ll try canned apples. So easy  and good. Yummy
7961	1013	This recipe is awesome. I make some teeny changes. I only use one brick of cream cheese and use my fingers to pinch of little pieces. I also add cinnamon to the egg mixture. This recipe is bomb as is. I’ve been making it for years for Christmas morning but made it tonight to be a good wife and mom.
7962	1013	Absolutely LOVE this receipe. Always a hit with friends!
7963	1013	I've made and enjoyed it!  Try it with a vanilla sauce, like Birds custard, instead of blueberry sauce, super easy and excellent too!
7964	1013	Great recipe with a few modifications as everyone is suggesting.  I used French bread, half of the cream cheese and double the blueberries.  Easy to make the night before.  I made it for 6 teenage boys and they gobbled it up.
7965	1013	Make sure you do it overnight. Be sure to have cream cheese spread out. The sauce is to die for, you may want to make extra. It's on the sweet side, so we served bacon on the side. Delicious!!
7966	1013	It's on the menu every year!.  I use sliced italian or french bread and I spread the cream cheese on each slice.   this assures that every slice has a good amount of cream cheese.
7967	1014	It was so easy and looked and tasted like they were made professionally!
7968	1014	it was good
7969	1014	it was pretty good! i would totally make it again.
7970	1014	Perfect! I wanted to do a small batch so used about 20 berries with 1tsp. of shortening & 1/2 cup of semisweet chips. Washed & dried berries. Melted shortening in microwave bowl for 30 seconds, stirred in chips & microwaved another 30 seconds. Stirred & did another 10 seconds. Chips were about half melted so removed from microwave & stirred to melt the rest until smooth. Dipped with toothpick & stuck them in a colander to cool. A few were pretty top heavy & wouldn’t stay. (Styrofoam would be nice but I didn’t have any)
7971	1014	Good. Thank you.
7972	1014	I made them with the microwave instead of a double boiler. It was easier and faster.
7973	1014	I used coconut oil instead of shortening and that worked really well. I also used sprinkles instead of the white chocolate stripes. The styrofoam idea is brilliant.
7974	1014	Awesome! Tempered the chocolate (removed melted chocolate from the heat and added a few more chocolate chips, stirred until melted).  Dipped various sized pretzels in the leftover chocolate - these were a HIT!
7975	1014	NO changes
8017	1019	I thought they were just average tasting.
8018	1019	LOVE IT... use it all the time!
8019	1019	Made them several times.. Have used frozen as well as fresh berries.. Honestly either work makes no difference.. Have subbed the bananas for berries to make an amazing banana pancake..  Definitely a 5 star recipe!! Id give it more if I could.. The recipe makes 6 perfect pancakes with enough mix to make a nice smaller sampler cake.. The cakes rise to perfection..
8020	1019	was a bit dry. added a bit more water and it was better
7976	1015	Absolutely delicious! I actually had enough filling from this recipe for two pies. I may have eyeballed the measurements of the filling because I don’t have a kitchen scale or anything. So I scaled up the sugar and flour just a tiny bit to match. Not sure why people are having them come out watery. I made sure to wait for the pie to cool completely before cutting and it’s nice and thick! I don’t like sickly sweet so the sourness is 100% what I was going for, a bit like a Granny Smith apple level of sour. I didn’t do anything fancy with the crust. I did cover the edges with some foil in the oven to protect the crust, not sure if it was necessary but I like to do that. Paired it with vanilla ice cream! 😍😋 soooo good!
7977	1015	My husband said this is the best pie he has ever tasted. My changes:1. I made a butter crust from scratch.2. I didn't have enough strawberries so when I filled the pie it didn't look full enough to me. So I added a layer of blueberries from our bush.3. I forgot to add the butter before putting on the top crust.
7978	1015	Good recepe tastes really good
7979	1015	Best pie ever! It's so easy to make and my husband is OBSESSED with it. I've made it numerous times and it always turns out flawless. Side note: I never actually measure my strawberries and rhubarb. I just use what I have! Last time I was a bit low on strawberries but my husband didn't even notice, and neither did I! Oh, another note is that I always put large chunky sugar on top and I use less sugar than the recipe calls for on the top. Definitely make this recipe!!
7980	1015	I loved this pie filling! I followed it, didn’t use egg yolk topping though. Just brushed with milk and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Family loved it!  Used a whole wheat pastry from the Well Plated site which was outstanding.  100% family favorite.
7981	1015	Perfect!
7982	1015	The flavor was just superb! Not too sweet and not too tart! Be sure to use an all butter crust. So much better.
7983	1015	This recipe is perfect. Not runny or undercooked rhubarb. Let cool at least an hour in summer.
7984	1015	Ok
7985	1016	My jam isn’t working it’s staying a liquid and I used frozen blueberries
7986	1016	I didn't have enough blueberries, about 3 cups. So did little less than half the sugar, two dashes of cinnamon and half a real lemon. Turned out great!I'm going to add honey to it next time.And I took the recommendations to not bust the fruit until the very end and to tell when it's done if you pull across the bottom of the pan and it takes a second or two to bounce back.
7987	1016	Great Recipe since there isn't pectin I added 4oz. of sugar free apple sauce  worked out nice and It also cuts the sugar....Kim
7988	1016	I am diabetic so I substituted Stevia for part of the sugar.  It came out great and with few sugar carbs.
7989	1016	Couldn't believe how easy this was!  Wouldn't change a thing!
7990	1016	had to make more hubby loved it
7991	1016	I made this is aronia berries as it said I could do.  Needs a lot more sugar than one cup.
7992	1016	Great recipe but I had to cook it longer than stated.
7993	1016	Absolutely simple and speedy, but tastes darn good!
7994	1017	Tasty and satisfying
7995	1017	Previously I have made so many cakes but never was satisfied with the taste and look. But this time thanks to you and your recipe. The taste and texture was so so good. Blueberry cake is my favourite so tried making it and I am so happy with results ❤️ thank so much 💖
7996	1017	Very impressed! The other reviews weren’t wrong- it’s not overly sugary and it’s quite simple. I dumped everything together and it turned out fine
7997	1017	Best blueberry cake I've ever made. Thank you!!!
7998	1017	I baked it for 57 minutes and it was perfection.  Halfway through my first slice I was already thinking about making it again with my leftover blueberries.  SO GOOD!
7999	1017	Not to bad. I added a little extra milk. And a little cream of tartar  whipping the egg whites. Considering making with struesel topping.
8000	1017	Excellent! This was so moist and flavorful! This is a new favorite. I’ve made it 3 times in the last month. It’s now a popular request among my family
8001	1017	Soft and delicious, you can reduce the amount of sugar if you don’t want it to be that sweet but it’s perfect. 10/10 recommend. But I needed to bake it for 15-20 minutes more that the time given in the recipe.
8002	1017	this is a more sophisticated recipe than it may first seem, involving careful technique with simple ingredients, and i very much like, for example, the way yolks and whites are handled. but the "batter" i got before adding egg whites was stiff enough to be more like a dough than a batter. so blueberries and egg whites weren't really folded in, it was more like they were kneaded in, which means it all got worked harder than it should have. i used large eggs, and followed the proportions exactly. i  think it may have needed more milk, maybe 1/2 instead of 1/3C
8003	1018	I make these cookies all the time! I chill them in the freezer about 30 minutes before baking this helps them keep their shape!
8004	1018	These are the only cookies I make for people who like things a little less sweet. Can’t go wrong with butter. Used homemade ollalaberry jam and Santa Rosa plum preserves…yuuuum!
8005	1018	Colorado.
8006	1018	These were perfect.  I got 42 cookies. I used a different jam on each tray. I didn't end up using the glaze.
8007	1018	I had a problem with flat cookies and dough spreading until I put the cookie sheets in the fridge between batches and always chill the dough.  No more problems.
8008	1018	One of our favorites for years. I roll the dough into balls then chill for about an hour before filling and baking.
8009	1018	So easy and delicious!  I love this recipe.  Thank you for sharing
8010	1018	I chilled the dough overnight (as comments suggest) and the dough was too crumbly too roll and still flattened. Going to try a batch with baking soda.
8011	1018	First time making Thumbprint cookies. They are delicious and will be making again. Can’t wait to try different preserves. I followed the recipe and did not alter. Made 28 vs 36 cookies and felt they are the perfect size.
8012	1019	AMAZING
8013	1019	The pancakes came out great and will be using this recipe again. I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen. They were thick and fluffy just the way I like them. This is much better than a batter from a box. Thanks you
8014	1019	a little thick for my liking
8015	1019	Delicious pancakes, a little too thick for me but very good. I used big organic blueberries (had in fridge) They came out beautiful 🤩 Was only able to eat a few. I’ll definitely make these again.
8016	1019	Absolutely delicious pancakes. I used fresh blueberries and they were so sweet and flavorful.
8022	1020	I made this sauce and it was great but thin.  I added a little corn starch mixed in about a tablespoon of water to thicken the sauce a little.  YUM
8023	1020	Looking for something to add to layer in  mini trifle cups with lemon pound cake and pudding.  I made the recipe as is, and it worked perfectly!  Tart and delicious.  Straining it takes patience.  Break it into three batches and press firmly with a spatula until only seeds and thick paste remain.  Remove those before adding the next third.  Recipe yielded about 1.5 cups of sauce.
8024	1020	This was exactly what I was looking for.  A seedless, not too sweet, beautiful raspberry sauce to compliment my cheesecake. (I couldn't resist licking my plate!)
8025	1020	I really wish I'd read the Cook's Note before jumping in, because I would have skipped adding water to make the sauce even thicker. That said, I was able to get it decently thick through the straining process, and it tastes great. Also super simple. Two thumbs up and golf claps, good job.
8026	1020	Excellent!  Easy to make.  I made a couple adjustments though.  I didn't need that much so I used 12oz of fresh raspberries, same amount of sugar and only 1 squeeze of a lemon wedge.  Still tart.  I also used 2 tablespoons of water.  Next time I'll make double, use 1.5 x the sugar, still one squeeze of a lemon wedge.  It's okay to have extras!!!!
8027	1020	Excellent!!  I left the seeds in mine because we don’t mind them. Thanks for the recipe!!
8028	1020	I needed a little more sugar. If you want a thicker sauce just makes a little cornstarch with water, add to the mixture, heat and stir until thickened. Also for those who don't want to strain the seeds out I would highly recommend getting a food meal. This will take seeds out of almost anything and is good for things like mashed potatoes.
8029	1020	Grocery stores in my area did not have frozen raspberries. At the last minute, I decided I would have to buy fresh raspberries and try to make my own sauce. I'm so happy I found this recipe. It's EASY and delicious.....I did strain the seeds. This step produced a beautiful, colorful sauce. Great taste. Not overly sweet. I would call it tangy. I'm going to make another batch and will keep some on hand.. I think it will be a great dribble over vanilla ice cream or over french toast or over morning biscuits or as a flavor enhancer for club soda....A Tasty Little Treat!!!
8030	1021	Well I made an attempt at this recipe BUT it didn't say wheather or not you were supposed to put the jars in a water bath after filling so I assumed you just fill the jars, seal and let set. It only filled like 5 1/2 8 oz jars.
8031	1021	Standard freezer jame recipe, but this one calls for WAY too much sugar. I felt like I was committing a crime with just 2 cups of sugar, which I stuck with instead of the 4 cups this recipe asks for. Jam came out great, though I would recommend draining a bit of the strawberry liquid, which this recipe does not ask you to do! Still good, just needs corrections made!!
8032	1021	Sure was easy Ann Miller
8033	1021	I love the recipe and easy to make. I used the Sure Jell for less sugar and cut the sugar in half.
8034	1021	super easy to make…even for a “non-cook” like me. I did add a few more berries….had about 2 1/4 cups of strawberries ( 2 quarts halved and crushed).Made it in 2021 to rave reviews. Trying to replicate my success in 2022.
8035	1021	Super easy recipe, love the flavor. Used chunky strawberries. Turned out great!!
8036	1021	I have made this multiple times following the recipe exactly and each time it is super runny. This isn't jam consistency but more like syrup. I am sad because I have 36 jars now of something I cannot spread on bread.
8037	1021	Yes I’ve made this before !!!  My mother always made it !  One thing I would like to pass along , the freezer jelly after opened , if you don’t want it to become runny , you must put it back in the freezer
8038	1021	This was way easier than I thought it would be.
8039	595	I love it ♡I didn't use all of the ingredients listed but I used; 1 cup banana, 1 cup strawberries, about 1 cup Chobani Vanilla Greek Yogurt, 4 tablespoons OJ & I put tasteless Collage Peptides in mine too.I will use this recipe again, it's ezpzbrze to remember & very yummy 😋
8040	595	Came out yummy.... thank you so much for the super simple smoothie recipe for the kids and me to make!
8041	595	it is good
8042	595	Love this simple delicious smoothie. I used fat-free plain yogurt and it was perfect. I also threw in a few mango chunks only because I had mango on hand. Will definitely make this again!
8043	595	YUMMM!!  I added some blackberries and graham cracker crumbles.  So good!  Will be making again for sure, adding my chia seeds too.
8044	595	It’s wonderful, I made it for my family and they loved it!!!! The only thing I might add would be to made more the suggested, because of small portions.
8045	595	First smoothie I've ever made. Came out great. Was thick and tasted great. I used honey instead of white sugar and tried out some chia seeds. Highly recommend
8046	595	It was good. Definitely would benefit with more pineapple and orange juice, and likely a little more yogurt and milk. Otherwise, good and simple smoothie to make.
8047	595	Absolutely delicious!
8048	597	It was good, I doubled it because it says it only makes 2 servings. We ended up with 10 servings. I swapped whole milk for soy milk and it needed 6 tablespoons of sugar. I tried 2 cups of cherry berry mix instead of strawberries, Great flavors!
8049	597	I used almond milk instead and no suger.i also added plain yogurt .I feel it didn't need any sugar.o ya I also added chia seeds
8050	597	I added mixed berries and pineapple to the recipe. No sugar or vanilla. It's sweet enough. Great recipe! Filling too!
8051	597	Loved it! Added teaspoon of vanilla extract instead of 1/2 and also 2 tablespoons of sugar, made it so much more rich!
8052	597	It was pretty good! The only thing I can dock this recipe on is possibly the addition of the oats. It does add a slightly grainier texture to the smoothie, but I don't mind this personally. Some might, hence why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.
8053	597	I love oatmeal , bananas and strawberries ! Delicious ! I use Oatmilk though , I can’t drink the soy milk at all , I use the unsweetened version of the oatmilk and it makes any smoothie taste great !
8054	597	I added protein powder, chia seeds, skipped on the white sugar and still delicious.
8055	597	Delicious!  I took other reviewers’ advice and blended up the oats first.  I added white beans for protein.  It was really smooth and tasted like a milkshake!
8088	1027	I absolutely love this! I made it for "happy hour" with my daughter. The first batch I made as the recipe said except I used lime flavored carbonated water and it was a little too sweet for me. So when I made again I only used an 1/8 cup of sugar and that was perfect. Thank you for sharing your recipe.
8056	597	This is probably the best strawberry oatmeal smoothie I've had in a long time! I don't have a powerful blender, but 1/2 a cup of oatmeal turned out to be just fine (if you blend the milk and oatmeal first, you shouldn't have a problem with graininess --or just blend the oatmeal into a powder before you add the other stuff). I tossed in a handful of spinach and used vanilla protein powder instead of vanilla and sugar, since it was a post-workout smoothie, and it tasted amazing.
8057	1024	The salad I've had it before and like it, but the dressing it's just perfect. I follow the recipe to the dot, except that I omitted the onions. The dressing was loved by everyone, including my hard to please hubby. Recommend it!After reading some comments, i need to add that for salads, you need to use fresh ingredients. Using frozen fruit or veggies will add an extra moist that will ruin the meal. I washed and clean the strawberries, let them dried on a paper towel and I put them in the salad just minutes before serving it.
8058	1024	I loved this recipe. I committed the cardinal sin of changing some of the recipe, but that tells me that the recipe is very forgiving. I cut back the sugar and oil in the dressing, added canned mandarin oranges, thinly sliced red onion, blue cheese, and honey roasted nuts. Thanks to everyone who contributed to making this a great recipe.
8059	1024	The dressing was perfect light and tasty I will use this on alot of my recipies for the salad, I used spinich,strawberries, red onions, walnuts. Very delisious! I am going to make this tomorrow but use spinich,Boild eggs, Bacon and the poppyseed dressing.  I might use my FoodiGrill and ad chicken to the recipie 5*****
8060	1024	I made this for a potluck…it was said it was the best dish at the event.  I cut the sugar in half and used balsamic vinegar.  Delish!
8061	1024	Loved this salad. Very refreshing. I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and halved the amount of sugar.
8062	1024	I really liked this one - I've previously tried the combination of strawberry and arugula, and I must say, this one is even better. Will definitely be making it again 😉
8063	1024	I have made this salad for many potlucks and everyone raves about it and some ask for the recipe.
8064	1024	Excellent and quick salad.  We have started making it regularly. As others have noted, sugar should be cut down unless this is your substitute for a brownie. Same with olive oil. 1/3 cup is perhaps sufficient.  Using this as a base recipe, we have tried different toppings (cucumbers peeled and diced, roasted pumpkin seeds and other nuts, red onions etc). They all come out good.  You can mix the produce and nuts and add dressing when ready to eat and it can be reused over a couple of days.  Packs well for lunch if made in the morning.
8065	1024	It was too sweet. I would cut back on the sugar next time, and the dressing went a LONG way! It was so delicious though. I could not stop eating it.
8066	355	Was one of the best i have had yet.  I'm not big on smoothies but this one is one i can handle.
8067	355	Very versatile--I also throw in a hand full of fresh spinach.
8068	355	Made this for lunch today, we had a peach that needed to be used and all the other ingredients! Threw everything in the blender and it's delicious. I added a couple of scoops of vanilla flavored protein since we were having it as a meal replacement. Thank you for the excellent smoothie!
8069	355	I added a banana.  Liked it but will continue to try adding other fruits.  This was my first ever smoothie. I'm hooked. I'm sure I'll be making plenty more.
8070	355	Super easy, super yummy, super fruity! I used V8 Peach Mango juice and it is very healthy.
8071	355	This is the hard way to make a smoothie. We use frozen fruit right from the freezer. No need to add anything else.  You can get an amazing variety of single and mixed fruit. So delicious!
8072	355	Made it with the suggested fruits and the only change I made was to add vanilla yogurt instead of juice which made it creamy.
8073	355	Our first try EVER making smoothies and this was our first stop for a recipe. We had everything minus the mango juice,but it tasted a little  sour so we added honey to give it a boost of sweet, not much but some! Thanks for the recipe, we will be testing  W/ other fruits as well.
8074	355	Love smoothies. I used mango strawberry and Banana. Left out the juice though. and added some greek yogurt.
8075	1026	Made awhile ago. Sorry no picture. Used creasantrolls instead of cookie dough  as base. Added whip-topping and marshmallow fluff to cream cheese. Also used cherry and blueberry pie filing instead of fresh fruit. Delicious!
8076	1026	Everyone loves this dessert. I used the 8 oz Cool Whip as others had suggested, completely dried the fruit, and froze the crust with filling one hour  before cutting, then added fruit after cutting. I used white granulated sugar and it turned out great. My only comment is that the time estimates on this recipe seem off. When you add in the time to make the crust, let it cool, make the filling, spreading the filling on the crust (which is NOT easy), cutting up and draining the fruit, I’d say even working as many steps as possible concurrently, this took a solid two to 2.5 hours.
8077	1026	Easy and delicious recipe. I wouldn’t change a thing.
8078	1026	Wonderful recipe!  Loved the crust!
8079	1026	I used this recipe to make the cookie crust without having to run to the store to get a tube of cookie dough.  But I added the orange juice glaze from Fruit Pizza II and that was GREAT.  My guys all said it was very good.  I made a '23' with kiwi slices, for a birthday, and filled in the rest with strawberry quarters, raspberries and blueberries.  They accused me of using it as a color blindness test, because nobody saw the 23 until I pointed it out, they all tried to figure what the red design was! LOL
8080	1026	I made this for 4th of July this year and it was off the HOOK! literally gone in an hour!  follow all instructions.
8081	1026	Delicious! I’ve made this multiple times for friends, and it’s always a hit. It does get soggy after being out for a bit, so keep in the fridge until you’re ready to eat. I wait to put the frosting and fruit on until right before a party, as well. Also, it’s helpful to cut the pieces before putting fruit on top.
8082	1026	I have made this recipe so many times and it is a hit every single time. I usually have to make two because my kids will flip if they don’t get any and I made one to take somewhere. Absolutely delicious and easy. Works with any fruit and any variations. I have added lemon zest or orange zest to the cream cheese mix, I have added a touch of almond extract to the sugar cookie mix...and I make it exactly as it is written. Yummy every way you make it!
8083	1026	I doubled the recipe and made it into a flag for 4th of July.
8084	1027	The recipe was great! I substituted the  lemon lime soda for Hawaiian Punch this time and it was phenomenal
8085	1027	My daiquiri needed more ice because it was watery, but it tasted good
8086	1027	Very good
8087	1027	Delicious
8089	1027	i added a bit more sugar and ginger ale soda , i also used more strawberries that were frozen fresh. The flavor was pretty nice.
8090	1027	Way too sweet.
8091	1027	really refreshing when its hot outside and good flavor
8092	1027	I think it was a little bit to sweet but other than that it's GREAT!??
8093	1028	I opted not to use the 8” cake pan, and made 8 biscuit shortbreads. It took the same 15 mins to cook. Turned out exactly like I had hoped. Good consistency and taste.
8094	1028	This is exactly the taste when my grandma used to make it. The only change that I made from the recipe was I used Becel Buttery margarine instead of shortening. I don't know what the deal is about using the proper amount of baking powder, which does not aluminum in it, but it was fine. I would also think that adding vanilla would give it an entirely different taste, this is Shortcake birthday cake.
8095	1028	I had never made a strawberry shortcake before, and so was relieved when this recipe was easy to bake. It turned out delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and, while 3 pints was too many strawberries, I was completely satisfied with the results. It was biscuit-y, but still definitely a cake.It didn't cut easily towards the bottom, and was not a stable cake, but the taste made up for it 100%.I recommend only using 2 or 2 1/2 pints of strawberries and adding a slight amount less sugar to them, as mine were extremely syrupy.I was concerned at first when I put the batter into the pan, thinking it wouldn't spread or rise well, but it did so perfectly.This is a great dessert for any occasion: it's easy to make and wonderfully tasty.
8096	1028	The recipe is perfect, just like my Grandma used to make. However, I assembled and served it like my Grandma did. I baked the shortcake in a loaf pan. After baking, and cooling slightly, I sprinkled the top with a dusting of sugar and allowed the shortcake to finish cooling. When serving, I cut the shortcake much like I would cut and serve a piece of cake. I then put the piece of shortcake In  bowl, covered it with the prepared strawberries ( and some of it's juice ), and covered that with desired amount of milk. When eating, break apart the piece of shortcake so that the shortcake can soak up some of the milk. The combination of shortcake, strawberries, and milk in a bowl make for a delicious treat.
8097	1028	I did add one extra tsp sugar to shortcake and to the strawberries.  My pan was also 9 in so the cake is flatter than the recipe but it worked. Tasted great.
8098	1028	Cake was bad.
8099	1028	Family loved it.  As the other reviewers noted, I only used 2 tsp baking powder instead of 4, 1/4 cup sugar, butter instead of shortening, and I used buttermilk instead of milk (had it in the fridge).
8100	1028	This is a great recipe! It is meant to be a dry biscuit-like compliment to sweet delicious strawberries. As others commented, I did reduce the baking powder to 2 1/2 t. and I used 1/2 C. Butter instead of shortening. I highly recommend using a food processor if you have one. It was so simple that way.
8101	1028	Before you change the recipe try it out. It was delicious.  Soft and not dry.  My husband likes bisquick and I prefer something homemade.  This was a perfect meet in the middle.
8102	1029	I made this last year. It was amazing!  Going to make it again this year for my bfs birthday. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen ;)
8103	1029	Love this recipe as is, I get asked for it multiple times a year. I can't help but wonder if some of the negative reviewers got mixed up and used evaporated milk instead of condensed.
8104	1029	This strawberry cheesecake was bom it was delicious I loved it.
8105	1029	Great recipe. I use fresh strawberries instead of frozen/
8106	1029	Wonderful recipe, love it!
8107	1029	Turned out delicious. Used chocolate Graham crackers and omitted cinnamon but those are the only changes. Family loved it. Wish I had done the water bath so it would have been prettier, but tasted fabulous.
8108	1029	Follow the directions to the tea in the cake cracked multiple places and never quite finished cooking in the middle or anywhere around.
8109	1029	I use  a different crust recipe (Nilla Wafer crust,) but I follow the cheesecake recipe exactly as posted.  It is awesome!  My swirls on the top never end up looking as pretty as the OP's photo, but that's not the recipe's fault.I'm driving 6 hrs to visit my daughter and SIL this weekend.  The only thing they want is this cheesecake.
8110	1029	Good for the most part. The mixture was very tangy. But 3/4 cup of sugar helped balance it out.
8111	1030	I swear I'm a gourmet chef when I make this. 5 stars!!!!
8112	1030	Love the recipe! Two variations: used fresh strawberries and pulsed the ingredients. Came out perfectly. Yum : )P
8113	1030	It was perfect
8114	1030	Easy to make and delicious to eat!
8115	1030	This salad dressing was perfect. Thank you for this simple, flavour-filled recipe.I’d like to give a special shout out to the “individual” that gave this great recipe 3/5 stars for the reason below:I used frozen blueberries and added a chive. The taste was there but it turned into ice cream had to add water. Next time I'll thaw whatever fruit I'm using.You basically rewrote the recipe and blamed someone else for your stupidity. Who does that? You probably leave your shopping cart in the lot too.
8116	1030	I detest bottled dressing so my go-to is plain old oil and vinegar.  This strawberry dressing is delicious and very simple and quick to make!  I can’t wait to try it with other fruits!
8117	1030	I love the recipe. You can use any other frozen unsweetened berries. To make it lower in sugar, I used 1 teaspoon of Splenda liquid sweetener instead of honey. You can add more for more sweetness without calories.  It was amazing 😍
8118	1030	Easy and yummy.
8119	1030	I added my twist to the recipe. I also added some white sugar as well.
8120	1031	I loved it soo so much I did add a little lime juice though and it made it a whole lot better!
8121	1031	I did use fresh strawberries( 1lb) and not quite as much sugar and water and after reading that some people added lime juice -I added some lemon juice( didnt have lime juice),tasted great and so easy and fast! Will be my go to filling!!
8122	1031	This was great! I used 1 tub of fresh strawberries and lime juice and real vanilla. Will be my go to!
8123	1031	Someone suggested adding lime and that was the best decision ever. This came out so delicious
8124	1031	Personally me, i didn't have a problem with getting that thick consistency, it turned out very thick. I think it's probably because I used regular strawberries instead of frozen.. It's super delicious heh
8125	1031	I added another 1/4 cup corn starch, another 1/4 cup sugar and 3 large dashes of lemon juice. Brought all to the boil and used a potato masher to blend the strawberries in. Much better! The original recipe wasn’t sweet or thick enough for me.
8126	1031	It turned out quite nice. I put slightly less sugar and it is delicious with a funfetti cake. Turned out a little runnier than expected but absolutely scrumptious.
8127	1031	I followed the directions exactly and it came out great!! But does anyone know the shelf life for it??
8128	1031	It worked really well in the cake that I made today. It was super easy to make and I used frozen strawberries to make it and it worked great. Since I used frozen strawberries I did use a lid to help them heat up faster but not burn them.
8129	314	So delicious!  This might be the best pie I ever ate.  Followed the recipe closely since it was my first time making it, although I didn't have unsalted butter, used salted butter & no extra salt instead.  Used a 9 1/2" deep-dish pie pan with raspberries, blueberries, & blackberries.  I had an extra 1/2c or so of berries after rinsing them, so threw them in - glad I did.  It made a nice single layer in the pan.  After splitting the dough in half & sprinkling it on top, I had extra dough (?).  I didn't have any overflow after it started to bubble, another 5 minutes to brown the top, then removed it.  The 2t of cornstarch worked for me, I was able to slice it like a pie.  So glad I tried the recipe.  Next time I make it, I will be more generous with the crust/crumble & buttering the pan.  Excellent!!  As they say, a definite keeper :>)
8130	314	This was one of my staple desserts when I was a chef down in Lakeview Oregon a couple of years ago. I was told by at least over 85% of our customers that was the best dessert they've ever had. Thanks Chef John, love your program and insight to food
8131	314	I made it already 20 times, at least. A really nice recipe. Since I don't always have all three types of berries suggested by Chef John, sometimes I replace some two by plums or a grated apple. This works out fine, though I would not skip raspberries. Also, the short cut of using self-raising flour (without salt and baking powder) works well, unless you confuse it with the usual flour...
8132	314	This just did not taste good. I followed recipe exactly. I'm a frequent baker as well. But the crumb was tasteless.
8133	314	I made this last night as my husband has been reminding me that we need to use up the berries in the freezer. I followed the recipe exactly as is, without any changes, except that I cut it in half. I also topped it with homemade whipping cream. It was super delicious!  I only have one thing to say to those people that omitted the pinch of cayenne pepper…DON’T! It’s very subtle but just what it needed to give it a little extra punch of flavor! I’ll definitely make it again! (My husband made sure I saved it!) ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
8134	314	What a terrific recipe!  It is so easy and so good.  A steady supply of berries of all sorts has had me looking for some good and easy recipes and this recipe is it.  I sometime half the crumble recipe  and it is still wonderful.
8135	314	Great recipe, turned out delicious!
8136	314	This Berry Crumble is beyond ultimate.  I followed the directions, except I left out the cayenne.  I also followed the instructions that Chef John gave on the video. This recipe is a keeper, for sure!
8137	314	This recipe is a great base for the crumble (as I like a bottom to my crumble). It’s definitely does not have enough fruit though and I’m not a huge fan of tons of fruit in my crumbles. 3 cups seemed to skimpy compared to the amount of crumble when you mixed it up. I doubled the filling  amount (6 cups, double lemon juice, double sugar etc). I also Replaced the white sugar with brown sugar in the crumble and added a dash of cinnamon. I Replaced brown butter in place of the regular butter (I use 1 cup brown butter as you tend to loose some butter when you brown it (brown then freeze, don’t use hot melted brown butter) . I also added oats to the second half of the crumble (maybe 1/4-1/2 cup. I also add enough vinegar to make it more wet).  You can replace the 6 cups fruit with any variety you want. I’ve done peach blueberry strawberry. Apple raspberry and blueberry etc. it’s absolutely divine the way I’ve altered it! I highly recommend trying it my way as brown butter is life! Even if you don’t want brown butter as the comments suggested double the fruit amount. I’ve made it like 5 times now my way lol. I like my crumble crispy so I turned on the Broiler for a second too.
8138	1033	absolutely amazing!
8139	1033	So good! I used frozen strawberries & fr banana, omitting ice & subbed honey for sugar, whole milk & a bit more yogurt. Super creamy
8140	1033	Awesome! I doubled the recipe, used frozen strawberries, no ice, and vanilla yogurt and no vanilla extract, and 3 tbl of sugar. I've also added one banana to change the flavor a little. I've used frozen mangoes instead of strawberries, too. Quick, easy, and delish!
8141	1033	This smoothie was absolutely amazing! the strawberries were sweet so instead of 3 Tbs of sugar I added 2. It was really good and you could serve it with breakfast.
8142	1033	I tried this recipe out and it was one of the best smoothies ive ever made , this was so good but also easy and simple 5/5 .
8143	1033	I replaced skim milk with whole milk and used less yogurt
8144	1033	Wow this is delish! I tweaked it a little bit. I used 2% milk and instead of plain yogurt which I didn’t have at the time, I used what I had and grabbed the coconut yogurt that’s in the Chobani Flip Almond Coco Loco yogurt. That coconut really makes a difference and gives it an almost pina colada flavor. So good!! Try it!
8145	1033	Thanks so much B and L,Delicious and nutritious. I made this exactly as suggested, with Strawberry Kefir instead of skim milk and two scoops Vega Protein Made Simple vanilla flavored.  Now back to my smoothie and blogging to help develop exceptional lives.
8146	1033	I've been looking at recipes for a strawberry smoothie and this one looked the best to me. And it did not disappoint! So yummy! Now I am really glad I cleaned and froze all those strawberries last year! Highly recommend!
8147	1034	These are amazing! Our family loved them!
8148	1034	it sucks
8149	1034	This is the best recipe I have tried. The only thing I changed was serving the creamy filling and strawberries on top of french toast. Thanks for the great recipe.
8150	1034	The family thought it was restaurant worthy.  Based on feedback, however, I cut back on the sugar by half that was a good call.  Wonderful.  It's a keeper.
8151	1034	This was a very good recipe but like others I cut down on the sugar which I thought was perfect.   I also drizzled chocolate sauce over the top.   Delicious!!
8152	1034	Made it. Loved it. Freaking delicious
8153	1034	Very delicious! And verrrrrry rich! Next time, I would use just a slight smear of the cream cheese filling in each crepe, with more berries. The crepes themselves are perfect. My husband is diabetic, so I made the filling using Swerve powdered sugar substitute, and you couldn't tell it was not sugar!
8154	1034	Perkins hasn't got anything on this recipe!
8155	1034	Delicious!!  The filling was a touch too sweet but that can easily be fixed by adding less powdered sugar.
8156	22	Excellent.  Added one beaten egg to hold it together more. Doubled the stock (homemade) and doubled the butter. I'll chop the cranberries very small next time and reduce the amount. Used real herbs. Used pork sausage/less sodium.  Baked 40 min w foil. Uncover and bake another 20.
8157	22	The best stuffing I have ever made for 9 years now. My Father in law requested to cook for him on Christmas as my gift. My family loves it ❤️
8158	22	I have made this recipe for over 10 years now.  My entire family adores it!  And many people ask for the recipe.  I have made Gluten and Dairy free very easily.  I also don't stuff the turkey, I bake at 350 for 30-45 min.
8159	22	Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I think it’s a great recipe and everyone  liked it.  It will be even better next time because I’ll improve on these mistakes I made.  I used two different densities of bread; one disintegrated and the other was a little dry.  I will not double it next time because for 15 guests with several other side dishes there was a lot left over.
8160	22	I’ve been making this stuffing for over 20 years now, and it’s always been a huge hit w/everyone! This year I used 1/2 loaf“Dave’s whole wheat bread w/seeds”, along with the traditional 3/4 bag of sage and onion stuffing. [ I’m diabetic, and am trying to use mostly whole wheat bread ] I soaked my cranberries in fresh squeezed orange juice, to plump up, before adding them to my stuffing. (Yummy little pop of citrus!) I used Turkey stock, and a couple cloves of chopped garlic to the recipe. I also used 3 small Granny Smith apples chopped up. It tastes delicious & my husband can’t stop trying bites as he travels through the kitchen. LolI plan on stuffing my brined Turkey tomorrow, and cooking the rest in a pan lined with parchment paper (buttered) and will add a bit of Turkey stock if needed, as it cooks.Best recipe ever! :)Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!
8161	22	This is my go-to stuffing recipe and my family members have asked for the recipe. I had to double the broth though, 3/4 cup just isn't enough.
8162	22	Everyone loves when I make this. Especially me.
8163	22	I have been making this stuffing for years now. My family loves loves loves it!
8164	22	This has been a favorite every year for at least a decade. I cannot imagine a family Thanksgiving without it. My children, who are now grown, are continuing the tradition with their own families. I have never had anyone not like it. In fact, it is the first dish to run out.
8165	1036	Delightful.  The first time I made this as per the recipe- the batter is really thick and the muffins a little dense.  To resolve this I substituted a 4oz cup of strawberry applesauce for the oil.  The additional flavor and liquid really helped.  Also- this makes 12 muffins in a standard pan, 3/4 full cups.
8166	1036	Very moist fun to top off with a strawberry heart
8167	1036	Delicious with some adjustments (some are mentioned by other commenters too):- reduce flour by ¼ cup- reduce white sugar by ¼ cup- add ¼ cup brown sugar- add 1 tsp vanilla- add 1 tsp cinnamon- use coconut milk and increase by ¼ cup- add ½ cup frozen cranberries
8168	1036	I love these muffins, making a batch about once a month with frozen or fresh strawberries from the garden. Sometimes substitute 3/4 C whole wheat flour and often add chopped walnuts.
8169	1036	Delicious!!  I made it as a bread..
8170	1036	My husband and daughter loved these! These are my  adjustments as per the reviews:-Added 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla,-Removed 1/4 c of flour-Added 1/4 c brown sugar-Also split the flour between all purpose and oat, just for a little extra nutrients-Added cinnamon and brown sugar on topGoing to make them again this afternoon
8171	1036	Wondering what to do with some fresh strawberries that would spoil in another day, found this recipe. Great muffins, will most certainly make these again, big hit with the grand kids 👍
8172	1036	I was very excited to make these as I am a big strawberry fan. I was a bit disappointed. The batter was very dry. I had to add more milk to even get it to mix. They baked ok, but just tried one and they are very dry. Tasty, but dry. The only thing I changed is the flour. I am on a gluten free restriction, so I use gluten free flour. I have used this flour in every other recipe I make and have never had a problem. Don't know what happened here. Any ideas?
8173	1036	I doubled it and it made 24! I also made a single batch using my large 6 muffin tin with blackberries.
8174	319	Excellent! I like that it wasn't too sweet.  Easy to follow instructions. I had to add a 1/4 cup more juice to the batter and topped it with an orange glaze. It turned out absolutely amazingly delicious. The family loved it!
8175	319	Made this into muffins and a loaf. Added 3Tbsextra butter, softened)  and twice the orange zest cuz we like it that way. Whip butter and 1 1/2 cup extra sugar,, then beat egg innto that. Slowly stir in flower (don't overmix) Very yummy, will make again for holidays, not just winter, Easter too.
8176	319	I love the taste of cranberry and orange, and the balance of those is pleasing in this bread.  As others suggested, I doubled the amount of cranberries, used 1C of orange juice, added 1/2t of cinnamon, substituted vegetable oil for the butter, and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.  It was easy to double the recipe and freeze one of the delicious loaves for later.
8177	319	Everyone loved it and so easy to make!!! 😍😋Like others recommended I added a cup of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and I added 1/4 cup of fresh Orange 🍊 juice from the orange I used for the zest. Yummy 😋
8178	319	Good flavor but too dry. I would say cook less than 50 minutes. I now read the comments and agree that more cranberries would be good and maybe more orange juice as the batter was very thick.
8179	319	I have never made Orange Cranberry Bread before. This turned out very well, and my family loved it. It is bursting with flavor and has a good texture. I put an orange glaze over the top - I just mixed a little orange juice with confectioners sugar until the desired consistency. I had a little more than a cup of cranberries so used all of them. One thing I would change in the future would be to melt the butter before incorporating into the mixture - cubed butter was hard to blend in.
8180	319	absolutely the best I have ever made!!  I made mini loaves and glazed them with  an orange glaze while still warm and there are no words to describe the delicious  treat these were... All Recipes never fails to produce the greatest of recipes... always has been and always will be my go to site . I did chop my cranberries in my food processor and added , I like them chopped rather than whole.
8181	319	So easy, so good!
8182	319	Followed the steps all the way just used thawed out frozen cranberries. Turned out very good. Bread texture just right and it was delicious. Will make again  thank  you
8183	320	I made it and it was excellent.  Next time I may cut the sugar by two cups for 4 lbs of baerries.THe lemon juice was great but I used arrowroot too.
8184	320	Loved it!!
8185	320	I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out absolutely perfect!  I am amazed!  I wonder if I can use this method for other fruit jams as well?
8186	320	Delicious, will definitely make again.
8187	320	Came out pure runny! ☹️
8188	320	Didn't change a thing and LOVED it!  So simple and delicious, and you can easily adjust recipe to accommodate more or less raspberries.  Four cups of berries made four small mason jars of jam.
8189	320	Great start however I made the following changes:A) cut the sugar by about halfB) I cooked it for about 15 min on high stirring constantlyIt hardened beautifully and tastes amazing!
8190	320	Easy to make and delicious! The recipe only makes 4.5 8 oz jars, not 7. I will make this again.
8191	320	My bread machine has a jam setting, so I made this recipe in it. I made two batches, the first 1C raspberry, 1 C sugar and 1tsp lemon juice. It thickened too much and was too sweet, but still very good. The second batch, I used half the sugar and what an explosion of flavour! Raspberry jam is my favourite. Homemade raspberry jam is the only kind I'll eat from now on. So easy in the machine too! This was the first time I'd ever made jam and can't believe how easy it is. Thanks for forgetting the pectin and giving us this great recipe.
8192	1039	Love the sauce.  It is my go-to recipe now for cocktail meatballs.  I buy the frozen prepared meatballs to save time and energy, so I can't comment on that part of the recipe.
8193	1039	Delicious! The best I’ve ever had!
8194	1039	I made this to bring with me as an appetizer for Christmas Eve at family gathering.    They were a big hit!  I will definitely make these again.
8195	1039	I love this recipe! Great for a party appetizer!
8196	1039	This is the BEST cocktail meatball recipe I have ever made! EVERYONE asks me for the recipe at every party I bring these to. The recipe is easy to make, and easily adaptable using pre-made frozen meatballs in a slow cooker or pot. Make these and watch them disappear! Pro-tip, use Sriracha hot sauce for an extra kick and another dimension of flavor
8197	1039	Delicious and a popular appetizer. So easy to make. Prep took practically no time at all.
8198	1039	I get asked for the recipe every time I make these.
8199	1039	Such a big hit. This is a keeper.
8200	1039	Very tasty.  I like this sauce with lil smokies, too.
8201	1040	Definitely took longer than 25 minutes. Also, I had to simmer it longer to get it to thicken (about an extra 10 minutes). I also strained the liquid out and was left with a lot of pulp. It made about 3/4 cup of syrup. The good thing is that my kids thought it was good and that the process was cool.
8202	1040	I liked the recipe, but I think it would be better if you blended the strawberries in.
8203	1040	Was a great Substitute for the strawberry syrup at the store. My son can’t have red 40 and this is a perfect add for his drinks!!
8204	1040	No changes at all ! Wife loved it for pancKes
8205	1040	An amazing syrup! I don't have a strainer, so I just kept the strawberries in there, makes for a fuller, more filling topping!
8206	1040	Super easy, very sweet obviously. I only got a cup of syrup (not sure if it's right). Standard syrup recipe, bookmarked.
8207	1040	Very good a bit watery for my taste but that can easily be fixed by adding a small amount of flour about 2 teaspoons give or take.
8208	1040	I MADE THIS! but it does not look like the picture i saw here. instead it looked like red syrup. the instructions did not state that the pulp was to remain behind. i strained the liquid from the strawberry's and discarded the pulpy stuff and was left with red syrup. the photo looked like strawberry jam.
8209	1040	I made this to use as a syrup, rather than a sauce. Made a double quantity and added a tiny amount of vanilla bean paste before cooking.
8210	1041	yummy!
8211	1041	The Blueberry Tea cocktail has been a favorite of mine for many years and I usually ordered them out but rarely made them at home.  I use a nice Earl Grey in mine instead of the Orange Pekoe and I think it's a very nice alteration.  Favorite winter time soother!
8212	1041	I like to drink this when I’m sick with a cold too. I steep fresh ginger slices with the tea and add honey. Makes me feel better and helps me sleep.
8213	1041	I made this as described and it was lovely. It was so good that I finished that drink and immediately made another. My husband didn't like his, so I poured his over ice and drank that as well. Even better on ice. Is drank a real word? My only criticism is that it is potent and delicious and I am drunk. Next time i.will double the tea and halve my consumption. ACES!
8214	1041	I love this cocktail. I enjoy making it with an earl grey tea.
8215	1041	The classic west coast version of this is slightly different. Add a muddled wedge of orange to the sniffer and a cinnamon stick. Also consider a good Earl Grey such as Mighty Leaf to accentuate the citrus flavours.
8216	1041	And what makes it better is a tbl spoon of whip cream on top!! So good!
8217	1041	It is a great tea to relax in the evening. It will send you to bed with a smile
8218	1042	made it  for years easy and delicious Treat
8219	1042	I have not made it yet, but it looks delicious.
8220	1042	Amazing dessert and strawberry topping would be great for an ice cream sundae. Could find the cups so I used a angel food cake and sliced it. Yumminess
8221	1042	This is how my mom and grandma put these together for us growing up & yummmm... just like home.
8222	1042	Perfect quick treat for the family
8223	1042	I loved it. Quick and easy!!!
8224	1042	was a delicious dessert that I think I am going to make it to celebrate memorial day and my dad coming home this recipe is quick and easy and I recommend it to anyone who likes strawberry s
8225	1042	so, i love it sooooo MUCH!!!!!
8226	1042	My family loves this quick and easy dessert.
8227	1043	These are so tasty and easy to make! You can also make as many as needed and then make more later. Keep the bag of filling in the fridge and, when wanting to make more, let it soften on the counter.
8228	1043	They are so yummy they don't last long once you put them out. They were a big hit.
8266	1047	I have made this salad a couple of times and we love it.  I substitute raspberry champagne vinegar and I add pecans and crumbled feta cheese.
8267	1047	Easy and delicious!
8229	1043	I doubled the recipe for 7 people, and I should have at least tripled it because they couldn't get enough. Had a lot of cheesecake left over, so I will probably get twice as many strawberries next time. As I piped the cheesecake into the strawberries, my family kept eating them. Half my platter was gone before I even officially "served" them. That was a week ago, and they're still talking about how unbelievably good these were. Did not add graham crumbs, but I will do that and maybe drizzle chocolate on half of them next time.
8230	1043	Doubled the recipe- I added a little more vanilla extract and some strawberry cake crumble on top instead of graham crackers. Great (somewhat healthy) treat lol.
8231	1043	I love this recipe!  I added some semi-sweet chocolate drizzle on top!  Amazing! 🤤
8232	1043	Screw the strawberries, I was eating the filling with a spoon haha!
8233	1043	This is amazing however I did add more powder sugar to make it a little more sweeter because the strawberries were a little bitter. I dipped them in chocolate and topped with Graham crackers and put a blueberry on top! Finger linking good ??
8234	1043	Wife loved these on Mother’s Day!
8235	1043	I really enjoyed this recipe! It is a great quick treat for my sweet tooth. I ended up halving the filling (sugar, vanilla extract, and cream cheese) and it filled the whole lbs. of strawberries.
8236	1044	Oh my gosh! This cake is so moist! The flavors are popping in my mouth. It tastes like a dream. My family loves it! I'm thanking our lord and savior, Jesus Christ, for this delicious recipe!!!
8237	1044	It tasted like fake strawberries. I would never put strawberry gelatin in this cake. It simply doesn’t taste like real strawberries.
8238	1044	I used oil instead of butter.  An older lady that lived next to told me to always replace butter with oil in any kind of cake except pound cake. Best baking advice I ever received. It makes your cakes light, fluffy and moist.
8239	1044	WOW! AMAZING SUBTANCE AND BESIDES IT LOOKS AND TAST SO GOOD! I LOVE! baking!
8240	1044	I made the cake twice. The first time I used all the recommended ingredients. The result was a great taste but dense. I baked it a 2nd time using 1 cup oil instead of 1 cup butter and baked it on 320. The result was a great taste, light & fluffy. Other than the two adjustments I made, this recipe is a keeper!! Thanks for sharing.
8241	1044	I used cream cheese frosting. I have a small bakery business at a flea market the cake was very well received by my customers
8242	1044	This was an amazing recipe, I will say though if using a taller pan it will need to cook a bit longer but overall really good!
8243	1044	The cake taste awesome but mine also came out too dense. A definite must is only using 2 3/4 cups of sifted flour. I tried added more liquid but obviously not enough.
8244	1044	I sifted the flour just like the reviews said. The only thing is that at 350 my edges came out a little crusty and the inside wasn't cooking that well, but other than that it was delicious.
8245	1045	thank you for all the step by step pictures. It was easy to make and turned out well.
8246	1045	I used about 1 1/2 c of sugar, and did it the night before Thanksgiving, so it had plenty of time to cool and settle. It was wonderful. I'm the only one in my family who eats it (and none of them eat the canned stuff, either), but that was fine. More for me!
8247	1045	If you love simple, straightforward cranberry sauce, this is a great simple recipe!
8248	1045	I just added some lemon zest and fresh lemon juice, kick-butt results!  Simply delicious!
8249	1045	I love this recipe, and have used it for years, I am diabetic so I use Splenda instead of sugar.  I don't add anything else to it, I make it the day ahead, so it is ready to go when I need it.
8250	1045	I had to actually ask for allrecipes cranberry relish recipe in order to find this one usually it just pops right up but, this time I had to search for it. I knew what it was but, I just like to make sure that I'm doing it correctly every time I have to check it. I just love this recipe. 😀
8251	1045	I’ve always made it this way, for decades. I add a good shot of Grand Marnier to mine after it cools a bit.
8252	1045	I added 2 oranges to this, cut up into small cubes. I don't eat it, but my husband loved it. Since whole berry cranberry sauce doesn't seem to be available in our area lately, it is a good thing it is so easy to make!
8253	1045	I made it as directed.  I felt it was too sweet.  I used orange juice. Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of sugar.  My wife added mandarin oranges and chopped walnuts.
8254	1046	I used my silicone baking sheets instead of greasing the pans and they worked great.
8255	1046	Love them my new favorite cookie now chocolate chip cookies are #2.
8256	1046	Minus the Sherry I have made these with both cranberries and chips, just cranberries and just chips.  Depends on what I have.  Family really likes these.
8257	1046	Good cookie. Gave some to my neighbor for Christmas and she loved them. Made it according to recipe except I used spiced rum instead of brandy, fresh cranberries, and 1/2 the sugar. Next time I will add some salt and more butter.
8258	1046	New favorite cookies!! Has a bag of white chocolate chips and no idea what to make. These are delicious! Love the cranberry & white chocolate combination. Definitely will be making these again.
8259	1046	These are delicious but definitely needs 1/2 teaspoon of salt
8260	1046	They were tasty! I was craving a white chocolate and cranberry cookie! :) Can’t wait to make again!- I replaced the brandy with vanilla. I also used an egg replacer from Bob's Red Mill as I didn’t have a egg. Everything worked out thankfully! Mine could’ve used less oven time (might’ve been the egg replacer).
8261	1046	I made these exactly as the recipe stated, and they were perfect. Depending on your size dollop of cookie, just watch for the under edges to brown. Mine were bigger, so they needed about 12 minutes, then the 5 minutes to rest on the sheet. The texture of the cranberry adds the chewy component to the soft and sandy base of the cookie. Outstanding! I did all the steps in my Kitchen Aid mixer until the berries and chips.
8262	1046	Perfect just as they are very moorish made some to take for morning tea and by the time everyone had eaten one there were very few left but what a great recipe will definitely be using it again and again
8263	1047	Amazing
8264	1047	Enjoyed this salad with the addition of sliced almonds and feta cheese. As many mentioned, too much sugar. I(I should have read the reviews first!). I tossed the dressing and started over with 1/2 the sugar.  Everyone enjoyed.  It was a hit!
8265	1047	Yummy. Took recommendations on half-ing sugar amount and it was deliciious! Also left off all the seeds since I didn't have any and used sliced almonds along with balsamic vinegar instead of white wine.
8268	1047	My family loved this salad and I did to but it was just a to little sweet for my taste thats why I'm giving a 4 star. Thank you for the recipe
8269	1047	It was yummy!  I used balsamic vinegar and not as much sugar as called for like some other reviewers suggested.  My husband had three big servings and said that was his new favorite way to eat strawberries.  The dressing got a bit thick in the fridge, but a few seconds in the microwave helped.  Thanks so much.
8270	1047	Made it as is and that's my 2 stars.
8271	1047	This was my first salad with strawberries in it and it was fabulous! I added some garlic grilled chicken for some protein.
8272	1048	I made these for my husband, who can no longer eat chocolate chip. A nice alternative to the usual suspects in the cookie world.Enjoyed with football tailgating spread.
8273	1048	These cookies are wonderful! Moist, chewy, but a bit crunchy around the edges. Depending on how you glaze them, they look very festive. A new fav at our house.
8274	1048	If you make them, eat them fast. Everyone gobbled them up. They have become a Christmas favorite.
8275	1048	These just might be my new favorite Christmas cookies. The kids loved helping make them too. I didn't really measure the orange zest, we just zested 2 full oranges straight into the bowl. I also accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda, but they turned out great. I did find I had to use a lot more confectioner's sugar in the glaze to make it not runny though. I had a fair bit left over so reducing the amount of orange juice to begin with would get the same effect. Mine were not cake like as other reviewers are complaining about. Maybe they just like really flat cookies in general.
8276	1048	Light and airy and just the right sweetness.
8277	1048	I followed the recipe exactly. They were cakey, tasted like yuck! I do not understand all the rave reviews and all the recipe alterations. Just give me a good recipe I don’t want to recreate one. Don’t recommend, this was a waste of time and ingredients.
8278	1048	Use 1C dried cranberries if you don't have fresh
8279	1048	The cookies are a big hit with everyone I've shared them with. I double the orange zest and didn't make icing. I like the cookie as; but a one of my friends flattens the cookie to make them crispy as she likes. Easy to substitute part of the regular flour with almond flour. Fun cookie recipe to experiment with - no hardship in eating any version you create.
8280	1048	11.17.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/40180/cranberry-orange-cookies/ ... Ooops, only added 1c cranberries. Too sweet. Maybe using 2c, that would partially be corrected; but I don't think completely. The last tray, I added some white chocolate chips & they were way too sweet, but I could tell the combination would be fabulous with less sugar in the cookie itself.  Reminds of blueberry drop cookies somewhat.  I used 1/2c margarine & 1/4c shortening. Think 1/2c whatever fat is probably enough.  They don't spread crazy, but they're flat.  OR, & this is probably the better choice than using less fat, add more flour.  That would bulk it up to not spread & would lessen the sugar factor.  For juice & zest, I subbed 2T frozen oj concentrate.  Forgot to add the 1/2t almond extract suggested - next time!   Mine done in 14.  I liked these & was pleasantly surprised that cranberries would cook that fast.  I was a doubter.  :)10-2022 Only 1c sug, +1t bp, 3c fl  Eh.
8281	1049	I made this exactly the way the recipe said.  It was great. The next time I make it, I'll put few less blueberries in it. Other than that, Fantastic!
8282	1049	My family has eaten this many times. Both grandmothers, my aunts, and mother use the same recipe, we just put it together a little differently. We melt the butter in the backing dish, then add the blueberries (or whatever fruit) then pour the topping over everything. It’s ALWAYS good!
8283	1049	Awful!  Whoever decided to add all of that melted butter was off, in my opinion.  Way too much butter.  Needs at least 1 tsp of baking powder.  Needs a pinch of salt if you unsalted butter.  Mine was swimming in butter around the edges and stuck all over the pan despite the pan being prepared.   The rest of it tried to fall apart… not in crumbles… in gooey chunks.  I don’t think anyone that claims that they made this by following the recipe listed and says that it is wonderful or fantastic is being honest because this recipe just doesn’t work as written and needs to be reviewed and revised. The recipe, is glue paste baked in fruit and butter that turns to jam thanks to all of that sugar.  If you want to try to make it… it can be easy, but the butter needs to be decreased and the baking soda needs to be added. Too much milk.
8284	1049	My Mom made dump cobblers using this exact recipe.  It is delicious and as said, very easy.
8285	1049	Love this!! I added a little cinnamon to the batter and the second time less blueberries…Easy and quick dessert 🥰
8286	1049	I made it by the recipe that was given turned out delicious
8287	1049	I only used 3 cups of fresh uncooked blue berries. I also used 3/4 cup of sugar. I did add 1 medium egg.cooked about 30 to 46 minutes. Until golden brown.
8288	1049	This is the easiest cobbler recipe there is. My grandma gave it to my Momma, and my Momma passed it down to her three girls. We all grew up on Country Southern cooking, which always included delicious, easy to make desserts like this one. I think we made more peach cobblers than blueberry, because canned peaches in heavy syrup were less expensive. Mine is in the oven still, so the pic is a while cooking  shot, not a finished shot.
8289	1049	It was very easy to make I'm just waiting for the end result
8290	1050	This is, hands down, the best dessert recipe I've ever encountered. I've made it for years, following the recipe, and people go crazy for it. I use more Oreo crumbs for the crust, I melt the white chocolate (I use Nestle's chips) in the micro, I wrap the pan in foil before baking it in a water bath (no seepage). I'm usually happy with 50 minutes at 325. I've never had to let it sit in the cooling oven. I worry about overcooking. And I always use frozen raspberries and strain out the seeds. A pain, but I feel it's better than using jam (I've tried both).  I have to laugh at the few bad reviews. This recipe is almost foolproof.
8291	1050	This recipe is always a hit.  I use Stonewall Kitchen Raspberry jam that I  heat to liquefy and then stir into the cake and drizzle more on top.  For the crust, I grind about 3/4 of a family pack of Oreo cookies in a food processor.  I add the melted butter as the recipe calls for.  I made this for my GF daughter and granddaughter by substituting the Oreo cookies with GF Oreo cookies.  Worked great.
8314	1052	yummy! added orange zest, ommited vanilla (didn't have enough) subbed sliced almonds for pistachio and cut when warm. Super easy!
8315	1052	I did not get a "dough" that I could shape. Wish I had used butter instead of oil - that may have helped.   I got more like a batter that could not be shaped into a log that would stay more than 30 seconds.  Waste of time and $$$.
8292	1050	Great recipe, but def have to follow other’s advice and add pan of water (to prevent cracks in pie), I used parchment which is so nice to not have to serve the pie on the bottom part of spring form pan, and shut oven off; leave pie in oven for 15 min after the (50 min), then open door and let it cool down for an hour in open oven. I used raspberry seedless jam and added a little water to it. I covered my pie w/ real whipped cream (home made), and decorated outer edge w/ raspberries & shaved chocolate on the center. Everyone of the 10 people at the dinner party ate every bite & raved about it! Thank you for a great recipe!
8293	1050	This cheesecake was delicious I never thought of white chocolate and half and half instead of condensed milk but it's amazing and this is gooding to be my go to recipe from now on!
8294	1050	I make this all the time as my go to cheesecake and it has been amazing every single time. I'll never make cheesecake without white chocolate again. I use graham crackers for a crust. There is a really brown looking cheesecake in these pictures and if you cook it right it doesn't look like that! It's amazing.
8295	1050	This cheesecake was really, really wonderful! My raspberry sauce needed a little extra cornstarch in order to thicken up, but this was the best cheesecake I have ever made - will definitely be making this again!
8296	1050	5 stars, everyone loved it!I doubled the white chocolate amount
8297	1050	Love! Made this for my birthday and everyone loved it. I personally would have loved a more raspberry taste in the cake, but the leftover sauce sold it for me. I put it on the side and they all added their own sauce. Some of my friends don't prefer fruity desserts so it was a win - win.This is the second time that I have made this cheesecake and the first time was an epic flop.If you are making this cheesecake, I highly recommend using chocolate chips. Last time I used another white chocolate and my cake turned out soggy, and it was just not good. I also wish I would have baked at a lower temperature, it colored to quickly. But if you are baking at the recommended temperature be sure to check it 20-15 minutes earlier like I did. If I had left it in longer it would have flopped. Also, I used a graham cracker crust, I think it's more fitting for this cake.
8298	1050	1st time I made it I used fresh strawberries & it was wonderful.  Today I made it according to recipe.
8299	1051	What a fantastic recipe! Made a single batch and it was gone by breakfast the next morning. I had a little of three jams: raspberry, four fruit preserve, and black cherry, raspberry, blood orange, so using that for the current double batch in oven. I also added coconut to the dry mixture and the first batch came out delectable. Love the simplicity and that it doesn’t ask for a cake mix like other recipes.
8300	1051	Simple and tasty. I wanted a more healthy version, with more of a crisp granola crust. I doubled the recipe, put it in a 9x13 oiled and floured and baked for +9 minutes. Changes I made to doubling the recipe: 1.5 sticks of butter, 1/2c light brown sugar, 1/2c coconut sugar.
8301	1051	These are awesome.  I made once as is and they were delicious.  The next time I made them, I added chopped pecans to the oatmeal mixture and added on top of the jam some frozen raspberries that I froze from fresh and then thawed.  YUM!!!  everyone that has had these bars loves them.  Thank you for such a great recipe.
8302	1051	very easy to make when in a rush. delicious and crowd pleasing. loved it
8303	1051	We absolutely love these bars I make them at least twice a month . They are so easy to put together great with tea or as a dessert served with ice cream .
8304	1051	These are so simple and were a hit with my son and friends (not to mention me!).  I used lightly sweetened strawberry freezer jam (I made it  when I had too many strawberries).  We don't actually used jellies or jams normally so I was excited to make use of it.  I'm actually making two more batches right now.  This time I'm issuing my homemade apple sauce for one and the other will be my homemade cranberry sauce left over from the holidays.  Both were in my freezer so I figured why not.  I did make two alterations.  I added some yummy Saigon cinnamon and I cut the butter in half and added avacado oil.  I couldn't tell the difference.  This time I'm going to use half coconut oil and half avocado oil.  I wouldn't attempt the coconut oil if I didn't already know my family doesn't mind the slight flavor.
8305	1051	My family absolutely loved these bars the first time I made this recipe. The second time I made these  I was low on quick oats so I subbed 1/2 cup of oats with 1/2 cup shredded coconut… and it was a success!! I would 100% recommend this change
8306	1051	No changes to recipe  except baked the bottom crust for 15 minutes before putting jam and remaining top mixture on it to make it crunchier.
8307	1051	I love this recipe. I made a special version for Christmas with 4 fruit jam (including raspberry), pomegranate seeds, and lots of dark chocolate. It turned out delicious, but the ooey gooey chocolate jam seed layer did make some of the outer edge pieces look a bit less neat and tidy.
8308	1052	Perfect every time! And every one loves them, even people who don’t. It’s crispy & has great crumb-like a biscuit, but not rock hard like some biscotti. I used standard olive oil, no flavor or texture issues & I drizzled with melted white chocolate. YUM! Make a double batch, they disappear quickly.
8309	1052	I made cranberry pumpkin seed biscotti using this recipe and they came out perfect! Easy base recipe
8310	1052	I appreciated how clear and simple this recipe was what I did different is instead of cranberries, I added dried apricots. I also used half eureka, lemon, olive oil, and half orange blossom olive oil. I also used zest from one orange from my garden and zest from one Myers lemon from my garden, and the flavor is incredible.
8311	1052	I have made these biscotti many many times. It’s a fantastic recipe. I absolutely need one every morning with my coffee.After using this recipe for a couple months, I happen to have a biscotti that had an orange flavor to it. I thought that would be a good thing to add to this one and see how it would taste. I added 1/2  teaspoon of orange extract and about one 1/4-1/2 teaspoon grated orange rind after adding the eggs. That seem to be enough to add an orange flavor.  A few weeks later I decided I wanted more orange taste so I glazed them with an orange juice powered sugar glaze. Keep in mind my five star rating is before I started the change. Since there are no more stars,  it remains a five-star rating. A big THANKS to Gerry for sharing.
8312	1052	All the times are off for me while making this recipe. Took longer than 35 to brown at 300, and much longer than 8-10 minutes to dry out at 275. The flavor is a bit weird, too. Not terrible, just a little off. I’d try a different recipe if you’re looking for something stellar.
8313	1052	It came out with really good consistency. Like everyone says, you can make it your own.  However 10 minutes in 275 degree is still too soft for me so I make it 30 minutes under 275 degree and it came out nice and crunchy. Otherwise, very delicious. 😋
8316	1052	Love this recipe, but just like anything else -you need to make it your own.  I use half flour and half almond flour. I add orange juice and orange zest- along with some limoncello.  I use less sugar.  Keep working it out til you love it as much as we do.  SO HEALTHY too!!!
8317	1053	Tasted wonderful and was well-received. Final product is runny but not overly so, with a consistency closer to syrup. Best thing was how beautifully clear it was providing the pie with a beautiful finish.
8318	1053	Very easy & very few ingredients!
8319	1053	I loved this recipe! Turned out great! I did not use fresh strawberries, but frozen unsweetened ones. I ran out, and used 3/4 cup sweetened strawberry halves to add to the mashed mixture. I strained my sliced strawberries to get rid of the excess juice. I used the juice from the bag and from the mashed pulp. Didn't have to add water. I'm incorporating the pulp in my sweetened strawberry container to use in my punch bowl cake. I used the filling for a Jell-O mold with sweetened condensed milk, crushed pineapple, strawberry jello, cool whip, and pecans. The fresher filling brought the mold to another level! Thank you for this recipe! Will definitely be making this again!
8320	1053	Thank you fotoe!78, this recipe came out better than expected! An interesting thing to add about the filling is that you can control the color of the finished product by adjusting the heat, which is pretty cool.
8321	1053	Made a homemade strawberry pie with whip cream.Super easy and delicious! Much better than the store bought  goop you pour over fresh strawberries.
8322	1053	It was easy and great flavor.  Used it as the topping for for the Kraft cream cheese/cool Whip cheese cake.  Every one raved at how good it was.
8323	1053	No idea what everyone else was talking about! It was not too liquidy, not dry, it’s just right! I was worried because a lot of people said it was too liquidy, but mine came out like a slightly more liquidy jam. I used the recipe to make mini strawberry pies (tarts). My only regret is not making more! If I knew they’d turn out this good, I would’ve filled them way more, but I was worried about it being liquidy enough as it was because of those reviews…I pre-baked my tart shells for half the amount of time for a full bake (5 mins), then let it cool, added the filling, then baked it again for the proper amount of time minus 2 (8 minutes). I did it this way because I didn’t want the bottom to be undercooked from being too liquidy. And minus 2 because I already baked it for half of the bake time but it had already been out of the oven for a while so I wanted it to continue properly. I don’t know if it makes sense to you but it makes sense to me ☺️Thank you so much for the recipe! I’ll definitely use it again! Maybe I’ll try it with cheesecake like another review said
8324	1053	Yum! Perfect recipe for strawberry pie filling, topping for pancakes ir cheesecake!
8325	1053	Instructions were a little confusing, if I hadn't had prior cooking experience in making stuff like this it might accidentally get soupy.Make sure y'all have a thick paste from the cornstarch, sugar, salt, & lemon juice (do an extra tablespoon if you want it less sweet) in your pot before you add the strawberry juice reduction, then stir in the juice and have ur stove at around a 6/7/mid-high so it gets bubbly. You HAVE to constantly stir, doesn't have to be fast but it does need to be fully incorporated.DONT use less sugar or you will have issues with it thickening, just add extra lemon juice to help counteract the sweetness.
8326	1054	As others have mentioned, this made a very thin syrup. Next time, I will  leave the water out of the initial heating and use a Tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in a quarter cup of water (if needed) to thicken. Taste was very good.
8327	1054	A good base. I find if you want a bit more zest and depth to the taste, towards the end of cooking, melt in some milk chocolate and add 2 oz. of premium whiskey.
8328	1054	The family absolutely loved this syrup.
8329	1054	Can't find blueberry syrup in the stores anymore so I just had it I make my own and this is great
8330	1054	Made it for homemade pancakes.  Was done by the time it took to fry the bacon.
8331	1054	My son wanted blueberry syrup for his pancakes. I found this simple and easy recipe online. It was soooooo good! My whole family loved it! No one thought it was too sweet and it really is incredibly simple. I did whisk a tablespoon of cornstarch to the cold water in the beginning. Then added the sugar and then the other ingredients. I also blended mine in my nutri ninja cup. It was perfect. Thank you for sharing this gem!
8332	1054	This is a very easy recipe to make.  I used 1-1/2 cups of frozen blueberries slightly thawed before placing in the pot.  I also slightly mashed in the pot to bring out more flavor. I look forward to picking fresh berries during blueberry season as they have the best flavor.  I used the recommended addition of corn starch to thicken. My family loved this syrup and will make again.
8333	1054	i didn't know what to do about the chunks of blueberries so i took my immersion blender to this. it was really sweet, but the lemon juice really helped level it out to be sweet and tart. not sure what I'll put it on..... I'll see how well it goes over pancakes
8334	1054	This was fantastic! I was out of syrup for our pancake supper and made this. It was quick and perfect as is ( I forgot the lemon though and it was good without it). Made this for 3 adult heart eaters and we had plenty left for next time! Thank you for posting.
8335	1055	TLDR: The dressing is too sweet so add less sugar and definitely add blue cheese crumbles.I was really unsure about the dressing. After a few hours in the fridge, I went to pour it onto the salad and the vinegar smell seemed overpowering, but it doesn’t taste overly vinegary. I love anything sweet, but the dressing was too sweet even for my taste, which I would’ve thought was impossible. Next time, I’ll cut down on the sugar. I added blue cheese crumbles and I can’t imagine the salad without them. They add a tang & saltiness that offsets the sweetness of the cranberries and dressing. I’ll definitely make it again.
8336	1055	So I got this recipe from the allrecipes magazine for my bday and we love this salad! It's really yummy. One odd thing I've noticed is the web version and the magazine version are different in a few ways. The dressing calls only for 2 tbsp of the vinegars, sugar and only a 1/4 cup oil. It , also only used 1/3 cup of almonds not the 3/4, I'm making more tonight 🙂thank you for an awesome recipe that we'll use many more times.
8337	1055	I have made this recipe several times, always for large groups. I have been asked for the recipe by multiple people at every event I’ve taken it to! At Thanksgiving, my sister (who is the foodie and best chef of the family) was eating my salad and one she made. She said, “I like your salad better than my salad. I’m going to need this recipe.” Haha— high praise!!
8338	1055	I halved the sugar.  That's it.  Delish recipe!
8339	1055	I’ve made this salad for years and it never fails to be a hit. Never any leftovers!
8340	1055	Great, but I cut the sugar by 2/3s . There is plenty of sweetness with the cranberries.  No need to add those empty calories.
8341	1055	This is hands-down the best version of this salad I’ve ever made. I think the secret is toasting the almonds, which really adds a depth of umami flavor to the whole thing. I made it exactly as written with the  exception of the poppy seeds, which I didn’t have on hand. Others have said that they drastically cut back on the sugar. I think the sweetness is needed, but the quantity of dressing was quite a bit more than I felt was needed for the amounts of the other ingredients. I made the dressing according to the recipe, dressed the salad with about 1/3 of the dressing and refrigerated the rest. It’s a matter of personal taste, of course, but I thought it was perfect that way. I’ve made the salad two more times using the leftover dressing. Thank you for a delicious recipe!
8342	1055	This is good just as it is written. I toasted the almonds and sesame seeds together, used red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that’s what I had. My hubby, who is not a salad lover, liked it a lot.
8343	1055	Delicious! Thank you
8344	1056	Very good. I followed the suggestions of using 3/4 cups sugars and butter. Still kind of oily. Maybe could cut back on the butter a bit more. Still very good.
8345	1056	I followed the changes suggested by other commenters. I used 3/4 cup white sugar, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup butter. I liked the taste with the reduced sugar. (Turns out my family wanted it sweeter. )I didn't dredge the dates in flour.I added 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients to make it more delicious.I used a 7 x 11 pan instead of a 9 x 13 pan. It was a mistake because the center didn't bake through, I had to put it back in the oven for 10mins at 350F.I might make it again using 1 cup butter, 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Plus 1 tsp vanilla. I think the vaniila is necessary.
8346	1056	Delicious!  They didn’t last long!  I made this following the recipe exactly. Many reviewers said they had a cake-y result. My batter was very stiff, and I did not “pour” it into the baking dish, I had to spread it. My bars turned out chewy, and were even better the next day. Next time I will wrap them, and serve after at least a day. Excellent.
8347	1056	I baked it on individual mini loaf pans instead in a 9 x 13 pan.  I notice that the center of the cake sinks.  why is that? do I need to adjust the amount of batter to be put of the mini loaf pans?
8348	1056	Thank you very very very much for sharing this recipe!!! :D :D :D
8349	1056	This is a nice little square that I will make again. I give it 4 stars because I found the amount of sugar a bit over the top, particularly because dates are sweet on their own.  I sieved some icing sugar over the top once cool enough, which dressed up the presentation.
8350	1056	Oh soo good! This has become a family obsession I make it almost every month. The recipe is great and accurate. My only tip/suggestion is the fluffier your butter the better the outcome.
8351	1056	These were terrific on their own and great with a scoop of ice cream on top!  I'm at altitude, so I added a quarter cup of flour and they were perfect.  Very sweet.
8352	1056	I just tried this recipe. Followed the advice in the reviews of using 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar,  3/4 cup white sugar and 2 eggs. The chopped dates I boiled in a bit of water until it loosened up, turned off the heat and then added the 1/2 tsp baking soda. It helped soften the dates and aerate it.  Didn’t have enough walnuts so added some almonds and cashews in. Cooked as instructed 10 minutes at 350F and 30 minutes at 300F. Came out chewy and with just the right amount of sweetness.  It’s now a family favorite.  Will be making this again.
8353	1057	Easy Peasy and so good. These cook fine without a toothpick to holdthe bacon as it will shrink up on it's own if you stretch the bacon before rolling.  I drizzle with Balsamic glaze before serving, very tasty addition for the full spectrum of flavors.
8354	1057	Nice recipe. Made some this way and then replaced the cheese with a water chestnut. Great both ways.
8355	1057	Super Easy and yummy!  Served with homemade honey mustard dipping sauce.
8356	1057	Sometime I use blue cheese and sometimes use goat cheese. Both are delicious. The goat cheese gives a milder flavor that more people seem to enjoy.
8357	1057	I modified this by cutting the bleu cheese with cream cheese and I added 1/2 of a pecan cut length wise. Then after wrapping in bacon, I rolled them in brown sugar. They came out delicious and the reheated well in the air fryer.
8358	1057	to die for
8359	1057	Stuffed the dates as full as possible with the Blue Cheese,  After they baked, you could not even taste the Blue Cheese, they were good anyway.
8360	1057	I love dates! Lots of people, however, have never tried dates or only had them in a dried/diced form. I had trouble getting people to try them, if it wasn’t for the bacon I think more folks would have turned done having one. They were a hit though!
8361	1057	Thank you. It was nice.
8362	975	For 9x13” pan I would double the frosting recipe.
8363	975	I loved this cake as a child and was so excited to find the recipe and think this is even better than I remember
8364	975	This cake is like a childhood favourite. My mothers family would call it poor man’s cake and this IS the Royal version!
8365	975	I combined the suggestions. (375 g of dates instead of a cup) soaked in boiling tea. I added sliced almonds and almond extract to the topping with a bit extra butter and cream. I also used half white and half brown sugar in the cake. And I cooked in a (bundt) chimney cake pan. 40 minutes cooking time Delicious.
8366	975	It is the best cake I have baked. It is a wonderful cake for a birthday or special occasion. It is also very nutritious.
8367	975	This is a recipe my grandmother used to make for us 60 years ago. I know I have it written in a paper somewhere, but was very happy to find it here. Love it!
8368	975	Super good, moist and flavourful. Only difference from my Grandma’s recipe are the walnuts which i really liked. Will definitely make again. Thanks for posting.
8369	975	Does anyone know how this fabulous cake got its name? A friend brought me a box of dates, and I decided to make this on a whi
8370	975	Such a.. GOOD CAKE!!!! Love this recipe!??
8371	1059	I used bananas in this instead of butter to cut down on fat.  It created a moist brownie that definitely filled the chocolate cravings. I will be making these often.
8401	1062	Delicious. Nothing like a warm dessert on a cold winter evening. I doubled the recipe, used a little less (left out  1/4 c sugar),  added a couple tbsp molasses and a pinxh of salt for colour and flavour to the sauce. Left out 1/4 cup sugar from cake as well. Mine has a slight aftertaste of baking soda so I will use a touch under a tsp next time. I served with custard and that helps with the sweetness and tastes fantastic.
8372	1059	This is a surprisingly good recipe! It’s very chocolatey and just sweet enough with some whipped cream on top. I made the date butter eggs vanilla mix in the food processor. Combined the dry ingredients with a whisk but didn’t mix in food processor with the wet ingredients. Instead, folded them together in a bowl and then folded in the chocolate chips. Sprinkled sliced almonds on top before baking. Baked in 5 ramekins inside the air fryer at 330F for 15 minutes. Yum!
8373	1059	Made this last night and added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. They are delicious!I
8374	1059	I found it could have had more sweetness and prefer not to use foodmixer. Might use again but would make by hand. A reasonable alternative but still has cholesterol and fat of course.
8375	1059	Great tasting cakey brownies! Next time I will try only 1 egg to get closer to a fudgier brownie. I like the subtle sweetness of the dates versus the taste of traditional brownies that use white sugar.
8376	1059	I made these and I added some (1/4 cup) organic maple syrup-! And a little more raw dates Also some organic chocolate chips
8377	1059	Great recipe! I used oil instead of butter, forgiving recipe if you need substitutes. Very yummy!!!
8378	1059	I was skeptical at first to try these brownies but I'm very glad that I did . They turned out very rich and moist and tasted wonderful, no one will ever know these are a healthy alternative to brownies
8379	1059	Made exact recipe. Divine!
8380	1060	I halved this recipe to make one loaf. It came out great! Delicious!
8381	1060	Tasty but not what I was looking for
8382	1060	Made this several times... it's a good thing it makes two loaves because it's hard to keep around... I substitute white sugar for light brown sugar and use real butter and not margarine... admittedly go a little over on the Dates... It is DELICIOUS and always a crowd favorite.
8383	1060	I loved the recipe. I made changes and did a half recipe with changing the dates and nut quantity for only sultanas and it was perfect...my husband is the sultana nut and loved loved loved it. Just making a loaf for grandchildren substituting dates for cranberries and choc chips for nuts. I'm sure it will be another big hit with the family.
8384	1060	I made this exactly as written and loved it. It froze well. I enjoy it toasted with my morning cup of coffee.
8385	1060	Worst recipe I ever tried.   I moved this past year and couldn’t find my recipe. Made Christmas Eve morning.  Heavy dense  nasty. No flavor.
8386	1060	I wasn't too hopeful with all of the comments so I made changes. I increased the temp to 350°. I used 1/4 cup of softened butter. I used 2 cups of dates and added 2 small apples. I added 1 tsp of baking powder. And I flavored with cardamom and cinnamon. I baked for about 59 mins. It came out moist and very good! But just a tiny bit underdone. I didn't leave it longer because the edges were really getting brown. Maybe next time, I'll start with a higher temp and then lower it for the inside.
8387	1060	Need to clarify water used to  soak date pieces also gets added to mixture.  Really unclear in directions
8388	1060	I gave 1/2 of the loaf to my manager and her parents loved it so much they took the rest home with them.  lol  My neighbor who I gave a inch slice to said this was the best date nut loaf she had ever had and she is over 70 and her sister is a baker.  So, yes, this is a fantastic recipe.
8389	1061	I experienced frustration when the mixture would not adhere and form balls. I set it aside. I used some butter and marshmallows to finish before this went into the garbage. I will brush with powdered sugar.  Too many rice krispies at 3 cups...scale down!
8390	1061	Love this recipe! I am gluten free this year, and no peanut butter...so was very sad to missing peanut butter balls, but not anymore! These are DELICOUS!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!
8391	1061	These are delicious!  I have been making them for Christmas for about 30 years. It wouldn’t be Christmas without them.
8392	1061	Exactly like my grandma used to make! I"be tried numerous other date ball recipes but none ever compared!
8393	1061	I made this, but tweaked just a little.  Instead of rolling into balls, i pressed onto a cookie sheet, and added a nice layer of toasted coconut.   The rice crispies made for a wonderful texture.  I will definitely be making this again.
8394	1061	This was an old family recipe that I grew up with every holiday season. When my home burned a few years back I lost my recipe - I knew what it had in it, but couldn't remember amounts. I was thrilled to find this and eager to make a batch or three. I did make a few changes that I'll share in the hope it will help folks who are having problems with their cookies not holding together. Be SURE to use baking/cooking dates and use cooking shears to snip them into small pieces. I use butter rather than margarine, and I limit the Rice Krispies to one cup. I also use very very finely chopped pecans. When you go to make them into balls, don't try to roll them between your hands. You want to squeeze it as though it's an exercise ball, working it around in your hand until it makes a 1" ball. You'll feel butter squeezing out between your fingers, but you also don't need to coat your hands with margarine! My mother always said these were a hybrid between candy and cookie - as they cool they become sticky like working with chewy buttery candy rather than a doughy cookie. When they're done they're tender and yummy kept at room temp. I hope you enjoy as much as my family always has!!
8395	1061	I think you should specify baking or cooking chopped dates which are found in the baking aisle and come in a solid lump as people may not be aware of them.  I omitted the chopped pecans and used an extra up of crispy rice cereal.  I rolled my balls in shredded coconut instead of powdered sugar.  I was able to get 5 1/2 dozen from my single batch.  They taste wonderful.  Thank you for using an eggless recipe.  I think it makes them vegan.
8396	1061	I tried something a little different, I didnt have dates so I used figs ( they say they can incorporate each other, also I had colored rice krispies. I also put a little powder sugar in my coconut. They taste good.
8397	1061	I made these the 1st time with the "candied like " dates. That was a disaster then I read in your reviews that you used the soft ones so made them a 2nd time and they were wonderful!! My mother made these every Christmas and she has been gone  5 years now and I crave some of her recipes. Now this recipe is exactly like she made. Thank you so much!!!
8398	1062	The best recipe ever! Now my favorite!  I used real cream instead of condensed.
8399	1062	I love it but, I wish I read luv2cook's comment on the caramel sauce.
8400	1062	AMAZING RECIPE. I did take it out a minute or two early so the center sunk a bit but my husband said this is his favorite dessert I've ever made.
8402	1062	I added walnuts, raisins, clove, ginger, nutmeg and cinnamon.
8403	1062	I made this recipe today and my husband and I loved it. I will definitely make it again when my kids come to visit.
8404	1062	Followed the advice of another reviewer and added more flower then made the sauce out of heavy cream, dark brown sugar, and butter. Was delicious! Definitely a rare treat.
8405	1062	I followed advice to use about one cup water. And I followed review suggested to caramelize brown sugar and butter for 5 minutes first before adding milk and vanilla. You will see a smooth texture arise when it has caramelized and I used a low simmer. Then a few more minutes with a whisk after adding milk and vanilla. Awesome and very similar to what we enjoyed when we lived in UK. I made it in mini loaf tins and cut loaves in half for service. Recipe made three mini loaves.
8406	1062	It was so delicious! Just like what I tasted in Scotland.
8407	1063	A definite winner! I made the recipe exactly as written. It was very easy to make, and is so moist and delicious. I'll definitely be making this often.
8408	1063	I added cinnamon and all spice plus subbed some brown sugar for white.  The taste is delicious but it was very crumbly (not dry).  Anyone know how to help with the crumbing?  Will make this many times!
8409	1063	We loved it!! Made it for Valentine’s Day and it was delicious. I baked it only for 45 mins though instead of the 50-60 mins .
8410	1063	Made this gluten free using Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour. It turned out fantastic. Thank you so much. It was moist and so yummy. The flavor was amazing. Will make this again.
8411	1063	It was excellent-- albeit too sweet for our taste even after  I reduced the sugar to ¾ cup. Next time I make this cake (and I will!) I will only add 2/3rds of a cup of sugar. This one is an absolute keeper!
8412	1063	SO GOOD. One thing that happened the first time I made it, was that the outside was a bit more crispy than my liking. It is probably my oven. So i recommend putting a timer at 45 mins and checking the loaf then. Just in case your oven is also a bit stronger than others. Other than that, amazing recipe.
8413	1063	It was delicious and nutty.  I made this during the covid so I had to make 2 substitutions.  The first was the baking soda,  i had to use 1 tbsp of baking powder,  and I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond.  It was a dense cake but lots of flavor.  Made it for Easter breakfast to go with coffee.
8414	1063	The best....simple to make and delicious !!! a must keep.
8415	1063	This is one of my absolute favorite cakes!  I didn’t sub a  thing ??made exactly as written many times since I discovered it. So moist and the flavor is amazing. Thank you for another excellent recipe!
8416	1064	Delicious!  I made a few changes, I traded the soda for baking powder, as I do for all from scratch cake recipes.  I also traded the walnuts for pecans. I  bake this in my aunts 100 +  year-old cast iron cake pan.  It comes out perfect every time.
8417	1064	This is my tried and true favorite recipe! Always a good go to when seriously craving cake, and very versatile. I've made it in Bundt pan, and also in a 9x13.. turns out great every time.
8418	1064	Awesome very good
8419	1064	Loved this cake! It's SUPER moist and has enough density that it has a slight chew which I loved.
8420	1064	Did not like this at all. Heavy and tasteless like another commenter mentioned. Used the freshest ingredients, followed to recipe to a T. Came out proper but the flavor is just not there.  I am a baker and love testing new recipes. This one is not one I will share with my followers.
8421	1064	the cake was good, and the frosting was awesome
8422	1064	I made this recently. OMG!!! Yum!! I made several changes: when I made the caramel, I first cooked all the brown sugar with half the butter for two minutes, then cooled the mixture. Then stirred in 1/3 c karo syrup. Then added the powdered sugar and vanilla and put it over the heat and added the remaining butter. I used a whisk and whisked it smooth as I boiled it a couple more minutes. When I took it off the stove I immediately poured part of it over the cake (the next time I make it, I'll poke holes in the cake so it can go down in it). Then let the caramel cool and drizzle the caramel over. Then sift powdered sugar over and top with chopped nuts. Oh, the other thing I'd change is to make the batter the day before and leave the nuts out, so that the raisins and dates can plump up and the spices can mingle. Then before you bake, add the nuts. Last change, it's worth it to spend a little extra time and make your own applesauce. I just chopped up some apples and cooked them, peels and all. It was AMAZING!! Sorry I didn't get a pic. It got in my belly too fast. Next time!!!
8423	1064	I really liked this. I just wouldn't call it "cake".  I had my own homemade applesauce to use up and so I had to halve the recipe and made it in a loaf pan. I did not frost it. I replaced all of the sugar with stevia. I replaced the sugar bulk with yogurt. It was delicious. I had two slices for breakfast with an omelet. It is dense.
8424	1064	I tried this recipe “Mother’s Applesauce Cake”. It was one of the best applesauce cakes I have ever made. I opted out using the frosting recipe and chose to do a simple glaze, my preference.
8425	1065	These were snatched up quickly at the party I brought them to. I loved the shiny mahogany glaze created by the soy/ginger/brown sugar combination. I was disappointed, however, at how much of the glaze was left on the pan after cooking. I recommend lining the pan or baking sheet with foil for easier clean-up.
8426	1065	These are always a great appetizer to have or bring to a party. I have also used water chestnuts in place of almonds. One time I was out of bacon and used Italian bacon. Worked out well.
8427	1065	they look and smell amazing!
8428	1065	These were pretty good. Next time I’ll not use the brown sugar, and instead will use maple bacon so it’s not as sweet. Also, will use low sodium soy sauce since there’s plenty of sodium in the bacon.
8429	1065	I made these exactly like the recipe and was very disappointed! I used Mejool dates, put 2 smoked almonds in each one, wrapped them with half a slice of bacon, dipped them in the soy sauce/ginger mix and dipped them into brown sugar, just on one side.  They turned out way too sweet and the dates were mushy. The sweetness even overpowered the bacon flavor!  Maybe a different type of date would work better. I won’t be making them again.
8430	1065	" it, I shouldn't have started eating these...they're addictive"! (Hubby's quote) Definitely will be making these again. Only modification was no almonds because I forgot them lol.
8431	1065	Awesome appetizer, I did add goat cheese as a stuffing in the date.
8432	1065	Well.... it was good but I don't think I would make again. The liquid mixture was of. Missing something.
8433	1065	We love these savory delights!  I did pre cook the bacon for about 7 minutes prior to wrapping as it shortens the overall cook time. I omitted the almonds in half the recipe as some family members aren't that crazy about that addition.  I have also substituted coconut palm sugar, as well as organic sugar, for the brown sugar (just our preference).
8435	1066	We love to make these during Christmas time.  They are very tasty and easy to make.  I use medjool dates because they are more moist and I like frozen coconut instead of dry.   They freeze well.
8436	1066	I love these !! They are so good you won't wanna share them !! Even your kids will love them ! Guaranteed!!
8437	1066	These are sooo good,,,love them,,i have to make a double batch,,one just won't do,,,love them,,,Thanks for the recipe,,
8438	1066	Easy. Deliscious.  I made egg shaped instead of round and colored the coconut for Easter.
8439	1066	These are delicious! I live extremely far away from any markets so I had to adjust the recipe to work with what I already had. I swapped out the 3c of rice krispys for 1c of oats and used agave rather than sugar. A little messy but totally worth it!!!
8440	1066	These were pretty sweet - I'm going to try cutting back to 2/3 cups sugar next time. They are yummy though!
8441	1066	I used Mediterranean dates and had to pit them but it also chopped them up...I also used a mix of 3 different people’s recipes and they turned out great! Just can’t recall how?? The best tip was using a pan instead of rolling balls!
8442	1066	These are a delicious, light dessert that present beautifully! I chopped the dates in a food processor, which is way easier than chopping them by hand. As suggested by other reviewers, I pressed the mixture into a coconut-covered pan and then sprinkled coconut on top. I also omitted the egg and replaced the butter with a margarine/coconut blend, as suggested by another reviewer. I don’t think those little changes had a affect on the taste. Every guest at dinner took a few home. Thanks for this delicious and simple recipe!
8443	1067	I was looking for a perfect recipe of these cookies, and finally I found it. The texture of the dough was very easy to work with, and the final result was amazing!I used coconut oil instead of butter, and cardamom instead of mahlab.
8444	1067	very simple recipe.  Out of preference, I added more orange blossom water as well as some rosewater to the dough, added more Mahalba as well.   I also added toasted sesame seeds, cinnamon and nutmeg to the date paste.  I used the dough to make two versions of the cookie.  In the second version, I toasted chopped walnuts adding some orange blossom water and sugar.  Both were equally good.  The trick is to let the dough settle overnight before going on to the next step so the semolina can absorb the butter.  thanks so much!
8445	1067	Thank you for this amazing recipe! My husband is from Jordan, and his exact words were, “Ooo very authentic tasting!” :) love these cookies and will make many times!
8446	1068	I love the flavor of these!I can't use banana, so I substituted with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, which usually works as a fine replacement. The flavor is still wonderful and the texture is soft but solid!I was very concerned about overcooking them, so I think I took them out too soon as I was over the time by several minutes. I also wonder about cooking directly on the pan as my bottoms weren't nearly as browned or crisp as I like. I really feel like I'd've had better results with the bake if I'd left out the parchment paper. (My oven tends to average theI plan to bake these again with some variations too! They seem like a great base for tweaking. In the future I might toast the nuts, soak the dates in fruit juice, add more spices, and possibly add other fruit like apple chunks!
8447	1068	I’m Allergic to bananas is there a substitution for bananas in this recipe
8448	1068	My husband made these delicious cookies, but...he used an entire banana instead of one half (accidentally). The outcome was a perfect soft cookie/bar that was perfect to put in lunchboxes.Seriously, these things could be marketed as healthy grab and gos at coffee shops and likes.Super.
8449	1068	Incredible cookies! We make Christmas Cookies for our family and friends every year and this is definitely our new favorite on our list!
8450	1068	I made them exactly as the recipe indicated. They are excellent! They really do taste like banana bread.
8451	1068	These are really good They are like banana bread with dates and pecans in a cookie form.  These would be good in a cookie bar form also. Thank you.
8452	1068	Just follow the recipe. It is a very delicious cookie recipe. Tastes amazing with a cup of yogurt.
8453	1069	Really great little energy bites! Thoroughly enjoyed the flavor! When I've made energy balls in the past, I've never added additional sweetener--I usually just rely on the dates for that--so I only added a little at a time until I got the sweetness-level that I personally enjoy, and that allowed these to still be formed into balls (about a 1/4 cup total). My one issue with these was with the addition of the  mini chocolate chips. They did NOT want to stick into these things, and it was a fight to get them in there. I also couldn't imagine adding a full cup of them. I used a 1/4 cup and that seemed to be more than enough--but that could just be my taste preference as well. I also realized too late that I'd forgotten the raisins, but will definitely add them next time. Using a 1.5 tbsp scoop, this made 23 balls for me. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make them again!
8454	1070	Not sure what happened with the temperature.. I thought I put it at 400 Celsius because the first time I made it, it almost burnt on the outside and was mushy on the inside. I made it a second time after adjusting the temp to 300. it’s a Good base line recipe. I made one with walnuts and added cinnamon, and another one with chocolate chips. It’s supposed to be a sweet bread not a cake which is exactly how it comes out! I added only 1/3 cup sugar instead of a full cup and I’m glad I did. I could have even used 1/4 cup sugar. the dates give it a lot of sweetness.
8455	1070	Wonderful, easy recipe.  So moist and delicious.  Hubs loved it too.  Will be filed in my quickbread recipes.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg.
8456	1070	I think its more of a bread than a cake, but it was really good!  Next time I'll make sure to have some vanilla ice cream to go with.
8457	1070	This was really good when I added nuts and chocolate chips! I could see how it would be boring without them! I’m trying to eat more dates since I am in my third trimester of pregnancy! The recipe couldn’t be any easier. Yum
8458	1070	I tried this recipe and simply loved it. I replaced 1 1/4 cup flour with 1 cup flour and 3/4 cup wholemeal flour. I also added a 3/4 cup of chopped pecans for added crunch. The result was simply mouthwatering date loaf. I was so thrilled with it I immediately made another date loaf :))
8459	1070	Sorry but this is not as flavourful as the old Good Housekeeping date loaf recipe.
8460	1070	Of all the recipes I have tried this is the first one that has not appealed to me at all.
8461	1070	I truly don't see why everyone loves this-sludgy and pretty much tasteless except for the dates.   I tried it because I had a big tub of dates and self-rising flour left over from another recipe, but this one is NOT going in my file.
8462	1070	Easy to make and delicious! I had some leftover dates and I didn't want to use eggs. It turned out great.
8463	1071	Delicious! Had to cook 25 minutes to get the desired cooked bacon. Also used pecans as I have troubles with almonds. Very addicting.:)
8464	1071	So delicious! Why have I never made these? I didn’t have smoked almonds so just used plain salted ones.  Cooking time was longer than the 15-20, but so worth the wait.  Can’t wait to make these again.
8465	1071	Use parchment paper instead of aluminum. Easier clean up. .
8466	1071	The whole family loved it!! A quick appetizer that everyone enjoyed!!
8467	1071	I made these last year for the holidays and everyone loved them so much that I’m bringing them again this year! I love that there are only 3 ingredients and the recipe is simple. I would suggest pitted dates if you can find them, just to save some time and messiness.
8468	1071	easy to make and delicious.
8469	1071	Everyone loved it!
8470	1071	Quick and easy.  This is not something I would have chosen to prepare if I had not had them at a party.  They are deliciously addictive!
8471	1071	So easy and so delicious!
8472	1072	Better than most date bars.   A lovely buttery flavour and cuts into neat squares easily.
8473	1072	I used this receipt to use leftover baking goodies plus cranberry sauce from the holidays… so homemade cranberry and orange sauce plus unsweetened coconut plus a handful of mini chocolate chips… not bad!
8474	1072	The dates are sweet enough without added white sugar.  I eliminated the white sugar and added an extra 1/2 cup dates + 1/8 cup water to make up for the difference in volume.
8475	1072	This is exactly the recipe I've been looking for. I fell in love with these bars when I found them at a bakery many years ago. The only changes I made were removing them from  the oven 10 minutes sooner because they had already browned and sprinkling them with powdered sugar which is how they had them at the bakery.  I'm grateful to have found the recipe.
8476	1072	I halved the recipe, used a little less sugar and water, and added about 1/4c of finely chopped walnuts to the oatmeal mixture. Perfect in a buttered 8in square pan. Loved it! And different fillings could be used... I'm going to try Nutella next time: mmmmmmm! Or maybe apple butter. A versatile recipe!
8477	1072	The dough came out a bit crumbly. The taste was spot on though. I reduced the sugar in the dough to 1/2. Willing to try this again using the exact recipe next time. I imagine the dough will work with other fruit jams as well.
8478	1072	My mom's matrimonials  were not made with dates so I kept looking and found English Matrimonials. Mom was from Scotland.  Same basic recipe except use 3/4 cup jam for filling.  Mom used raspberry so that is what I made.  For those who may not care for dates.
8479	1072	Consistency turned out great.  Next time I will add either pecans or walnuts to dates.
8480	1072	A buttery sensation!
8481	1073	My landlord brought me a bag of dates, I had no clue any to do with them. I went online and ran across this recipe. Man, these turned out freaking amazing. I did substitute the sesame oil with coconut oil and added some mini semisweet chocolate morsels, it’s like eating recess pieces… so good.
8482	1073	Love em just the way they are
8483	1073	These were delicious!  Like others, I did not use sesame oil; substituted almond butter and they were perfect.  You can also roll in cocoa powder if you want a bit of variety.
8484	1073	Awesome!  I substituted coconut oil for sesame oil as suggested.  I'm going to have to freeze some of these so I don't eat them all right away.
8485	1073	Loved these. Easy to make, can be made ahead of time.  We made so many we took them to a pot luck the next evening and we think they were actually better the next day.
8486	1073	Made these using a half teaspoon  of sesame oil.  Wish I wouldn’t have done that.  Next time I will make them using  light olive oil because all I taste is  sesame it drowns out the dates and coconut. Otherwise this is a good recipe.
8487	1073	I've made it twice, they were so good.  I lowered the salt and decided I liked it better with the listed amount.  I'm a Weight Watcher and they are 6 points, sadly.  But, I'm pre-diabetic and the sweet from the dates along with the nuts isn't as bad as a lot of desserts.
8488	1073	I made this recipe with coconut oil instead of sesame oil . I don’t like the flavour of sesame . I keep them in the freezer  in a ziplock instead of the fridge . Good healthy snack .
8489	1073	These are yummy but we didn't care for the sesame oil as it is a really strong taste.  Next time I think I'll leave this out or susti
8490	1074	I love this recipe! My nana used to make these, but I couldn't find a recipe that was just like them until now.  Cutting the rolled up dough can be a bit tricky.  I saw the suggestion of dental floss that seemed one to try.  I use a sharp knife on the frozen dough, but the sticky dates build up on the blade and tear the dough.  To avoid this I wiped the knife blade with a damp cloth every few slices and it worked perfectly!
8491	1074	VEry good but when I use dates I use little or no sugar. Dates, especiall medjol dates are naturally sweet and we Americans don't need more sugar!! Try it!
8492	1074	A butter substitute works fine.  I suggest increasing the amount of filling just a little bit.....there seemed to be slightly too little filling to cover the dough, and I wouldn't want to roll it any thicker.  i put a little cinnamon in the filling too....needed a bit more oomph
8493	1074	Taste is very delicious only recommendation is to keep the dough in the fridge overnight.  I kept it in for an hour and because of being anxious I made them right away. The dough was not easy to work with. Instead of looking like pinwheels some looked like rockes lol.
8494	1074	Thanks for sharing, Christy! Grandma made these every Christmas but I never got her recipe. Took them to family Christmas and some said they were even better than Grandma’s. I add 1/2 tsp or so fresh grated nutmeg to date mixture while it cools. Freezes very well!
8495	1074	I followed these directions doubling everything. and  needed   more filling so I made a 3rd batch to finish off the dough. I don’t feel I added to much filling but perhaps rolled the dough a little thinner, anyways, the cookies are great!
8496	1074	My mom always made these for Christmas, but replace the date filling with chopped walnuts.  The cookies would disappear so fast that mom got to freezing the dough and only baking enough for each day,  I am so glad I found the recipe again.
8526	1078	I made these for my medicinal edible needs. They taste really good and were really easy to make! This will be my main goto recipe for edibles!
8527	1078	To start these taste delicious. Recipe was easy to follow and really quick. Toasting the nuts and oatmeal made the flavor much better. This is now one of our favorite snacks in the house!
8528	1078	Quick. Easy. Delicious.  Hit the trifecta.
8497	1074	After seeing my Mom (who is in her 60’s) post on FB about how she was missing these little date cookies that her mother used to make I was on a mission to find the recipe. Of course I found it on AllRecipes! I made them and sent her a batch. My Dad called me a few days later saying that I made my Mother cry. She opened the box and tried one and said that they brought back so many good memories of Christmas and her mother. Thank-you for posting this recipe and helping to keep a tradition alive. I did take the advice of one reviewer and doubled the filling. This is a new favorite holiday cookie for my kids as well.
8498	1074	These are truly excellent! These are frankly better than my grandma's were. The dough is pretty hard to roll out, and the filling is challenging to spread far enough. The only reason I didn't give it give stars is that I would have liked more filling (next time, I'll just double that part of the recipe). I was very sad when they were all gone!
8499	1075	These were so delicious and easy! They were chewy, nutty, satisfying. I couldn't find my mom's recipe so I used this one and frankly I like this one better. I think it's the soaking the dates in hot water that makes the difference. I even accidentally put in too much baking powder and it still turned out great.
8500	1075	Pretty close to my mom’s recipe. There is no such thing as a 10”X10” baking pan so once I used 9” square pan and then I one and a halfed the recipe and baked in a 9”X 13”. I also added a little vanilla and the zest of one orange. It was a popular addition to my Christmas cookie platters!
8501	1075	Lovely consistency and aroma but I think the flavor was a little less than I expected - was looking for more date and nut flavor. I did use butter flavored shortening instead of butter but might use butter next time, a tad more salt and more vanilla and nutmeg (I did add vanilla). Perhaps the flavor will deepen as they continue to cool and are stored overnight. A very easy recipe to make with ingredients typically on hand.
8502	1075	Delicious!  Very moist.   I’ll definitely make it again.
8503	1075	As a child my mother made a similar  treat for me. I’m glad I found this recipe. I toasted pecans which I added instead of walnuts as that was what I had on hand. Also, I put in a tsp of grated lemon rind. Delicious! Next time I’ll use less sugar as it seemed sweeter than what my mom baked for us.
8504	1075	I made a larger batch (18 servings) and used a 9x13 pan. Instead of greasing pan I used parchment paper. Date bars are delicious and were easy to cut. Will be giving some away as Christmas gifts.
8505	1075	Bit more both spices added,maybe 1/8 Tsp. each additional
8506	1075	I made some changes used gluten-free flour and change shortening to butter and used half the sugar(dark brown sugar).  Still came out sweet and good.  Baked 3 times in the last two weeks.
8507	1075	Delicious, moist and chewy! I did not roll in powdered sugar and didn't miss it, unless you want for appearance.
8508	1076	I actually make these with chorizo sausage diced and fried with chopped cilantro for about five minutes.  I fill the dates with this mixture, wrap with bacon and bake at 375 for twenty minutes or until the bacon is crisp!
8509	1076	I really like this bacon and date appetizer. I usually make some from the best Medjool dates in California
8510	1076	Very quick and easy to make and guests loved it!
8511	1076	We baked at 400 degrees instead of broiled. It was great!
8512	1076	People seemed to like the combination.
8513	1076	I made it according to the recipe and they came out perfect! Guests said they were sinful and tasted just like candy! They all disappeared quickly!!!
8514	1076	I had my doubts, but this did not disappoint. It was the first of many appetizers completely consumed. I used roasted salted almonds and the bacon slices cut into thirds. I baked them at 400 for about 30 minutes, leaving a couple pieces in longer until crispy.
8515	1076	Delicious!  I made these for the appetizer stop on a progressive dinner.  No one had eaten them before and they were a hit.  I didn't use toothpicks and I had about 1/3 come unwrapped.  I baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes.  I popped the ones that still had some uncooked bacon in the microwave for about a minute and that finished them off right!  Definitely a keeper.
8516	1076	OK - seriously this. Is. Awesome! I made this for New Year's Eve party and came out awesome. Now, admittedly, I'm becoming a grillmaster, and had my own maple bacon that I did from scratch that I used as I had an extra batch around. So it tasted great with that. Couple things I would say - make sure you have the non pitted dates for sure. When I did this instead of putting a slice of almond, I use delivered almonds, then crushed, fried in a pan for about 5 minutes in a little bit of butter, gave it kind of a nice roasted flavor, and then insert that into each date, closed it back up, wrapped with bacon and then baked.
8517	181	I’ve used this recipe several times and love how the cookies turn out.  It’s just like my mother made.  I have made it with a regular hand mixer and also used a food processor.  Honestly, I prefer it in the food processor because the dates and other ingredients are more finely chopped and blended together.
8518	181	I chill the dough and then it rolls nicely
8519	181	My husband and his family love these and I just can't figure out why.  It's way too much work involved, so hubby makes them every year for the past 30 yrs.    They are just tasteless to me.
8520	181	These were my favorite cookie 55 yrs ago. My mom send them to me while I was in the army.  She got the recipe from the back of a Kellogs cereal box.  Been  looking for this recipe for years.  I added small bits of pineapple to a few of cookies when I baked them. YUM YUM
8521	181	This is a super old recipe that I believe was originally on the Kellogg corn flakes box. I'm in my 60's and my mom made them every year at Christmas and I've kept up the tradition. My mom never rolled them in the cornflakes though so I've never had them that way and they taste and look great just plain. They work well as a drop cookie and it is a little simpler to make. It is important to add the cherry on top to get that festive look. Oh, and I do substitute butter for shortening.
8522	181	They turned out really well.  Next time I will make them smaller.
8523	181	I found the dough to be too sticky as well, I added about 1/4 more flour and refrigerated for about an hour.   they still spread out  quite a bit.  Next time I make I think I will use less butter.  They were delicious though even with the extra flour.
8524	181	A true favorite in my home. Don't be scared off by the dates . They almost go unnoticed when you eat the cookie.
8525	181	A classic recipe that originally was posted on the back of a Kellogg's Corn Flakes box, years ago.  It is one of my personal favorites for Christmas time, which I have made for years.  It's not a super economical cookie, but its a great gift and they always disappear.
8529	1079	My mother used to make these cookies when I was a child, and I am 66 years old. So it's a very old recipe. Date-nut pinwheel cookies just say Christmas! They are delicious and if you only make them at Christmastime, it's not too much work, rather, it's a labor of love.
8530	1079	Very good.  I used orange zest rather than lemon juice and zest as that's how my mother used to make them.  I made these as part of my Christmas baking.
8531	1079	Pretty good cookie.  I wasn't sure how thin to roll the dough so would have liked that information.  The date pinwheels from my childhood had more flavor but maybe with thinner dough?
8532	1079	I made these cookies for the first time and everyone loved them. Will definitely make it again.  I added orange zest to the cookie batter. It was so delicious. Great recipe. Thank You!
8533	1079	These turned out great! I didn't have a lemon so I substituted orange and they turned out perfect!
8534	1079	Worth every step. Almost have a fig newton taste. And after there were some leftover after the holidays they were great dipped in coffee.
8535	1079	Too much taste testing as I went along!  The lemon adds a FABULOUS flavor.  I didn't find theses too time consuming.  I didn't change a thing.  I did take another reader's suggestion and used an electric knife for slicing.
8536	1079	These aren't bad - but they aren't great. They are less sweet and don't taste like traditional date nut pinwheels.
8537	1079	It has been 50 years or so since I've had these.  They are very close to what Mom made back then.  Sure they are a lot of work, but worth every minute.  The lemon zest and juice are just brilliant.  The right amount of tangy to offset the sweetness of the dates.  Mmmm, think I'll have another one.
8538	1080	I used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of butter incorporated in the-soaking date mix. Really yummy!!!!
8539	1080	I love the recipe, I had to change a few things; used brown rice milk instead of milk, used fresh dates instead of dry and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. the result is fudge brownies and i love it. Thank you
8540	1080	I added 22 large dates, 1/3 cup brown sugar, no vanilla, 11/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder. The cake turned out delicious, it did brown a bit from the bottom, but its probably my oven's mistake as it did the same for the caraway cake. I served it for my wife's birthday last night and 3 of us  finished 2/3 of it!
8541	1080	Excellent and Perfect recipe.
8542	1080	excellent recipe,  my family loved it, even kids enjoyed it, only one question since i made it in loaf tin, i noticed a small part in the centre was not fully converted into bread but didnt stick to the toothpick either. is it ok or i can change that
8543	1080	I tried making muffins with this recipe.. Baked at 220 degree c 180 watts in microwave convection setting...muffins did not rise much also I found batter dense so added 1/4 cup extra milk..
8544	1080	This is a birthday classic for us
8545	1080	Never goes wrong! Everyone loves it! Great as mini muffins too :)
8546	1080	The cake could have been better if butter used instead of oil but the colour would be very beautiful because of brown sugar and dates.The cake comes out okay
8547	1081	I used a mixed salted nut blend that I had on hand.  After blending everything it was definitely a crumbly consistency.  I opted to leave out the oil but added a couple of tablespoons of sorghum which did the trick of binding everything.  Flattened the mixture on wax paper and refrigerated for a bit.  The sorghum flavor is strong so honey may work better for some, I thought they turned out amazing.  Definitely will make again (or anytime I have leftover dates from Super Bowl appetizers).
8548	1081	These were SO much better than I had expected.  Loved them!
8549	1081	These are awesome. Added a heaping tbs of almond butter. These are the best my daughter is a taker. We will add other fruits another time. Feels like cheating.
8550	1081	Good recipe, I think the coconut oil is off. Perhaps it should be tablespoons instead of cups? I used
8551	1081	I’ve made these multiple times. My husband and children all love them m.  I have switched things up by using different combinations of nuts including pecans, cashews, pistachios and walnuts.  Turns out great every time. If the mix isn’t sticking together I just add more dates.
8552	1081	I made these as written and they were fantastic! I used sweetened flaked coconut because it's all I had, but next time I'll make sure to use unsweetened as the dates make it plenty sweet.
8553	1081	I added protein powder, vanilla, cinnamon, dry oatmeal, ground psyllium and SF maple syrup. The "dough" was initially too oily, but crumbly. Adding more dry ingredients and syrup was the trick. I rolled them into balls. Turned out fantastic! Taste like a Larabar bite!
8554	1081	The taste was great... but this didn’t give me bars. It gave me crumbles.. what am i missing that would allow this to firm up in the fridge.. after 2 hours i still had crumbles.
8555	1081	Sweet without sugar!
8556	1082	My mother made this when I was a kid and I have been looking for the recipe for years.  Thank you.
8557	1082	Very good! Reminds me of pralines. I used parchment paper instead of the cheesecloth & it worked fine. My roll did crumble too much. Next time I will put in a square pan & cut like fudge.
8558	1082	My grandmother uses to make this candy for us and it was very decadent. I was happy to find this recipe. Mine turned out a bit harder than hers, but tased the same. I need to use a candy thermometer next time and stop the heat just at soft ball and increase the flavor by one half.
8559	1082	My grandma Odom use to make this candy . and my mom  and aunt also  made it every year. They would  put it out side in a damp clothes in the cold snow to harden. Now  I make it for my kid's and grand kid's.if it does not set up you just get a spoon and dig in.I'm so glad to hear this  is still around with other family's.
8560	1082	I could not get the wet cotton dish towel off the candy roll after cooling.
8586	1087	Liked the taste of the cake, but it stuck to the pan that I baked it in.  :-(  Next time I will mix it in another bowl,  grease cake pan  and then pour batter into pan.  Then I will be happy!
8587	1087	Really good and very easy. I used 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup dk brown sugar plus 1/2 cup golden sugar, around 1/2 cup sweetened coconut mixed in and a little over 1 tsp cinnamon plus about 1/2 Tb vanilla.  I did mash the bananas. Very similar to hummingbird cake but much easier. I added the cream cheese frosting II from this site. My husband doesn’t like pineapple in baked goods but even he liked it.
8588	1087	Although very tasty, About 12oz too much pineapple compared to similar recipes. Did not bake completely in the center.
8589	1087	I did as others divided white and brown sugar. I add vanilla, Almond and cocnut extract. 1c of oil and 1/2c applesauce.
8561	1082	I gave it three stars because I'm not an experienced candy maker so I may have messed it up myself, but especially for someone inexperienced I feel the directions could be clarified some. I was not sure what heat setting to use, and then the wording made it sound like you don't stir the mixture while it boils for possibly as long as 20 minutes... I "cheated" and stirred it just a few times because I was really skeptical about not stirring a boiling candy mixture at all (but tried to follow the directions since I figured maybe the recipe was written that way for a reason). The result was burned sugar coating the bottom of my pan that was as hard as a rock and was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to remove. It took at least a half hour of constant scrubbing and scraping. Probably longer. The candy is edible but has a burned sugar taste. It's not terrible I guess, but also does not taste like my grandma's date roll candy. Afterward I looked around more and have seen other recipes that say to stir constantly. I'm not sure if I misunderstood these directions, but please clarify them or reconsider the whole "without stirring once the boiling begins" part. I will use a different recipe next time and be sure to stir!
8562	1083	I make these as bars and they are wonderful!  I use either craisins or raisins depending on what I have in the cupboard.
8563	1083	I was intrigued by this recipe, so tonight I gave it a try. I didn't have cannellini beans, so I used the 1 1/2 cups of black beans I had on hand (maybe black beans are vastly different from cannellini 'cause my recipe could have been a disaster),  When I got to the end, the "dough" was no dough I've ever seen. It literally would not hold together. I added 2 beaten eggs and 1/2 cup of milk, which saved the day. Oh, yeah, I snuck in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, too. And we don't like honking big cookies so I got 63 cookies at about 20-23 grams each. They are about 66 calories each. I'm happy.
8564	1083	I made the recipe as printed, with dried figs instead of dates. A bit dry and crumbly, so I added an egg and a 1/3 c of egg whites. Much better.....for the last few batches, I added dark chocolate chips....quite the cookie!!! made more than 18.
8565	1083	really tasty you don’t even notice the beans!! but i added applesauce and 1/2 cup milk which was definitely needed
8566	1083	really tasty you don’t even notice the beans!! but i added applesauce and 1/2 cup milk which was definitely needed
8567	1083	these were very good for a " healthy" treat. They were also easy to make. I used 1-15 oz. can of navy beans, rinsed as that was what I had in the cupboard. After reading the reviews, I also used 1- 15 oz. unsweetened applesauce to give the cookies moisture. I feel that you can pretty much add whatever add ins you want. I used coconut, dried cranberries, and mini chocolate chips.
8568	1083	Edit to my earlier review—it said to ground the oats. My bad. Guess I will have to try again :)
8569	1083	Followed recipe exactly and they were way too dry. They wouldn't even hold together into a ball to bake. I had to throw the whole thing out. What a waste of time and money!
8570	1083	The cookie dough was too dry.  I added 4 oz. of almond milk to the recipe and the cookies turned out great. Great tasting snack.
8571	1084	Such a easy dish, this definitely pleases the whole family!!
8572	191	I'm sorry but I found these to be tasteless.  I also added molasses and an extra egg to help with how dry it was.  I don't think I missed anything.  Reread the recipe to make sure I followed it perfectly.  Maybe alter it to your own liking.  I like how they were sugar free though.
8573	191	They look beautiful! I used honey instead of maple syrup, and added some slivered almonds just because I could.
8574	191	First time I made them I added some non-sweetened coconut and replaced extract with 1tsp vanilla and 2tsp almond extract. They were a huge hit at the party!
8575	191	Dang these are delicious! I can't make any recipe without messing with it just a bit so I subbed 1/2 cup of golden flax flour and since I'm not really watching calories or sugar I added a touch more maple syrup. Everything else was the same. I took other reviewers advice and cooked them at 325 for 25 since I was doing 2 consecutive batches.  They're quite light and held their shape nicely.  They cooked perfectly golden brown on the edges and bottom.  Great recipe if you're looking for something different and lower carb.
8576	191	was nice and quick to do given you have the ingredients. I searched for almond flour dates recipes... this was very intriguing and tastes amazing given no added sugar
8577	191	They tasted good but were quite crumbly. I might try puréed dates next time.
8578	191	I was looking for a simple date cookie recipe that didn't include sugar... and though I don't need gluten-free nor paleo, this cookie turned out amazingly! I followed the baking instructions exactly and the cookies were slightly crispy on the bottom/edges and perfectly flaky (not too dry) in the middle. For the recipe, I used olive oil instead of coconut oil, and I omitted the cherries, walnuts, maple syrup, vanilla... it was still perfect! I will be making these again. Thanks for a great recipe!
8579	191	These were delicious. I didn’t have all the ingredients, so subbed dried apricots for the dates, and 1 tsp vanilla + 2 tsp almond extract for the vanilla. I loved them! Great recipe to use as a base for other flavors.
8580	191	Followed the recipe as written. These turned out very moist and delicious! I brought them to work and my coworkers raved over them and asked for the recipe.
8581	1086	I love this recipe!  Been making these since I was a child!  My family and friends love them.
8582	1086	I changed the nuts to roasted pistachios, and coated with conf. sugar and coconut.
8583	1086	I’ve made what we call Pecan Date Balls for about 25 years. This year I tried this recipe and it was a complete fail. No matter how hard I push and pressed, the mixture would not form into a ball, it just crumbled. My recipe calls for an egg, which helps bind the mixture. This recipe I tried today seemed to have far too much butter. The mixture was flavorless to me. I read back over this recipe thinking I may have missed something, but I didn’t. I’ll stick to my family recipe.
8584	1086	About 5 minutes into cooking the sugar and dates (on medium heat) I got worried, but was determined to follow the recipe. At 9 minutes i thought "this can't be right, it is going to be like toffee", and took it off the burner and stirred the other ingredients in. Tasted great while hot, but when I rolled it into balls and they cooled they became too hard to even bite into. It took serious boiling of water, vinegar and baking soda to get the cooled mess off my pan!  Joyce do you really cook this for 10-15 minutes?
8585	1086	Very good! One of several treats I put together as Christmas gifts  this year. I remembered my mom always made these around Christmas so when I saw this recipe I had to try it out. They tasted so good and they're really easy to make. No baking involved! I used my Magic Bullet to chop up the dates and nuts so it was super quick.
8590	1087	We had a Jamacian good night and I made this and it was a hit, my sisters and family loved it. The only change I made was half brown sugar like other people did. Will make again
8591	1087	I took the advice of others and did 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and reduced the oil to 1c. I think the cake is delicious, but felt like it needed a frosting so I did a light layer it cream cheese frosting. That was a game changer and took the cake to a whole new level of delicious. I will definitely make it again. It’s a nice change.
8592	1087	Heavier texture than a cake, but flavors were nice.  Everyone liked it. I told them it was 'bread'!
8593	1087	Delicious and simple. I had to use up a surplus of broken almonds. I agree with others and will add one banana and reduce the oil and sugar next time to suit our tastes.  This makes a  sheet cake.
8594	1087	Enjoyed this cake and loved how easy it is to make and clean up.
8595	1088	Excellent! Added extra parsley and basil with Aji Lemon drop peppers. It came out extra green.
8596	1088	My son is from West Africa and pepper sauce is a traditional sauce there. I left out the dates and added a little fresh ginger root. Turned out great!
8597	1088	Love the taste. I bottled and shrink wrapped 2 bottles. How long will it last if not in the fridge? Kept 2 out to eat myself lol, gifting the other 2 to fellow hot sauce lovers. And I doubled the pepper count, I like it hot!
8598	1088	Yes I will make it again /substituted a fourth of a teaspoon lemon pepper and two tbls of white vinegar instead of lemon juice. I used pitted plumbs instead of dates and used half the amount of chili peppers. I reduced the oil on my second batch to 1/3 cup of smooth olive oil
8599	1088	Great recipe Shiloh, thanks for posting. As you suggested this is a fun recipe to experiment with. Each time I make it I change the ingredients a bit but never stray too far from the basic hot/sweet combination. It's always been very enjoyable and gets positive comments from everyone who tastes it.
8600	1088	This was very tasty!! For me, as-is needed a few things. And its Feb so peppers are obviously not in season. Im sure with peppers straight out of my garden it'd be better.
8601	1088	It was AMAZING. I doubled the recipe, used Santa Fe Grande peppers instead of chili peppers because I'm a wimp, and threw in a couple extra dates and an extra garlic clove or two. Used Minors Beef Base instead of beef boullion because that's what I had on hand.. It's wonderful on rice and beans, or on anything that you just want a yummy condiment. I'll make it again, maybe with a slightly hotter pepper or two thrown in.  Reminded me a bit of HP steak sauce but without the hint of vinegar.
8602	1088	Delicious way to use end of season over abundance of habaneros and santa fe  peppers.  No dates but dried cranberries as substitute did great.  Keeping it fresh too.  Tasted so good I thought cooking might mess it up.  Will not last too long at my house.
8603	1088	My goodness this stuff is good and addictive. I had fragments of each of these ingredients hanging around so I whipped up a mini portion to put them to use. I did use my own measurements as written in the notes but stuck to the ratios of the ingredients. I used vegan bouillon with nutritional yeast instead of beef. The aroma alone will entice you. I put it on baked tofu and it stole the show. There isn't one particular taste that stands out. It is simply a mix of flavours that accent the chile peppers. I used scotch bonnets for the principal peppers and added a large piece of a roma tomato. I can see where this would go well with everything. Definitely a staple to have around the table. Thank you Shilo for this recipe.
8604	1089	I made this delicious bread and shared it at my church this  morning after service.  It was an instant hit! Moist, tasty, totally satisfying. I plan to make it  again soon. THANK YOU!
8605	1089	The best, easy to prepare, moist and not too sweet absolutely  delicious!
8606	1089	I loved it!  You have got to really enjoy dates and walnuts to appreciate this bread.
8607	1089	Delicious! My husband and I both loved it! The only change I made to this recipe was to use 2 eggs instead of 1.
8608	1089	This recipe is great! I made some changes, and it was still good. I made a puree of the soaked dates and soaking water, then I mix the eggs into the blender. I left out the sugar because the dates were sweet enough for me. I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and added the puree. After baking, I added some finishing salt to the top and it balanced the flavor even more.
8609	1089	Wonderful!  I had two bananas to use up and was a little short on dates, so I mashed them and added in with the egg and brown sugar.  Perhaps for that reason I baked it for 1 hour.  Will make again with enough dates this time.
8610	1089	I have been looking so long for a Date Nut bread that reminded me of one we used to buy in the store so long ago. This one is very close. I added 1 tsp of vanilla,  but that really  was not necessary.  A very good dense bread. I eat it cold from the fridge with cream cheese.  So good.
8611	1089	Perfection! Just like I remember my mom making. I took two suggestions from reviewers and used a cup of hot coffee to soak the dates instead of water. And I wrapped the loaf hot from the oven in waxed paper and tin foil and put it into my fridge. It took all of my self control to wait until the next morning to taste it. Heavenly with cream cheese slathered on top! Absolutely will be my go-to recipe.
8612	1089	This bread is SO moist.  I have made it over and over again!
8613	1090	These were so good! I did about three tablespoons of espresso, and that was perfect.  I wished I had white chocolate to drizzle on top, but they were good enough without.  I didn’t even regret the loss of my adored medjool dates into the recipe. 😊  I also did two cups of almonds and one of cashews out of necessity, and I think it was better than it would been the other way.   My family and I ate most of them right away.Certainly recommend😋
8614	1090	These are delicious! There is the perfect combination of sweet and nutty. I love these as a healthy snack when I’m craving something sweet but trying to avoid refined sugar. I’ll be making these again!
8615	1090	This is pretty dang good! I love this because its healthier and taste pretty similar to a brownie with nuts!
8616	1090	Super yummy and easy. I added some shredded coconut on top for a twist.
8617	1090	Delicious!!!!
8618	1090	Just made these.  Wanted to sit down with a spoon and eat the whole batch.  I followed the recipe, and roasted both nuts prior to grinding in food processor. So chocolaty delicious!
8619	1090	I make this often and give to friends as special treats. I don't make them in bars, rather, I make 1 Tbs balls. They hold together much better if you roll them in your hands and put them into the fridge to set.  I've made the recipe "as is" a lot and have never had a problem with them holding together.
8620	1090	Delicious and so easy as written!
8621	1090	These things are excellent!  I used Brazil nuts and Macadamia nuts instead of what the recipe called for.  Also added in half a cup of dried cherries.   Also used Cold Brew versus Espresso and didn't seem to phase how good it came out. Beyond Excellent stuff....more addictive than Oreos!!!

1	3 tablespoons butter, 2 pounds Granny Smith apples (or other firm, crisp apples), peeled, quartered, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick, 1 pound Macintosh apples (or other soft-textured apples that fall apart when cooked), peeled, quartered, cored, and sliced 1/4-inch thick, ½ cup sugar, ½ cup dried cranberries, 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold (follow package directions), 1  egg white, lightly beaten, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 cup Optional: Ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream	Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add apples, 1/2 cup sugar and cranberries; cover and cook until apples release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until soft apples fall apart and juices thicken to a thin-syrup consistency, about 5 minutes longer. Pour onto a large-lipped cookie sheet or jellyroll pan and cool to room temperature. (Can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 5 days.)\nAdjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.)\nSpread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream.	8	2	https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/76931/apple-cranberry-crostada/	Apple-Cranberry Crostada	\N	\N
2	8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed, ½ cup unsalted butter, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, ½ cup white sugar, ½ cup packed brown sugar, ¼ cup water, 1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed	Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\nMelt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nPress one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.\nPlace sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.\nMake a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.\nFold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position.\nRepeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.\nSlowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatalie T\n	8	2	https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/	Apple Pie by Grandma Ople	30 mins	1 hrs

1084	1 cup basmati rice, 3 ½ tablespoons kosher salt, divided, ¼ teaspoon saffron threads, 2 tablespoons boiling water, ½ (8 ounce) package roasted noodles, ¼ cup grapeseed oil,   kosher salt to taste (such as Diamond Crystal®), 2 medium gold potatoes, sliced into quarter rounds, ¼ cup boiling water, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 6  Medjool dates, pitted and quartered, ½ cup golden raisins, rinsed and drained, ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon	Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with tepid water. Gently swish it around with your finger to activate the starches, then tip the bowl to drain water. Repeat this process until water runs clear, about 7 rinses. Cover rice with cold water, add 1/2 tablespoon salt, stir gently, and soak for 1 hour. Drain rice without rinsing.\nCrush saffron threads to a powder in a small mortar and pestle. Transfer to a small bowl with 2 tablespoons boiling water. Stir, cover, and set saffron water aside.\nFill a 5-quart nonstick pot with 9 cups water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 3 tablespoons salt and stir until dissolved. Break roasted noodles into thirds and add to the boiling water with the rice. Stir once gently, and watch carefully as it cooks so water does not boil over. Taste water for salt and adjust accordingly. Cook until the first rice grain pops up to the surface. Set a timer for 4 minutes and cook, scooping off any foam from the surface, until the timer goes off. Test rice and continue to cook until tender on the outside but still firm to the bite on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes more.\nDrain rice and noodles in a colander and rinse quickly with lukewarm water and a spray faucet to rinse off extra starch. Taste and gently rinse again if too salty. Set aside to drain completely. Wash and dry the pot.\nPlace the clean pot over medium heat.

Tightly overlap potato slices in a single layer covering the bottom of the pot to create the tahdig layer.\nGently scatter rice-noodle mixture over the tahdig in a pyramid shape, making sure potatoes are completely covered and moving noodles away from the sides of the pot. Gently poke the handle of a wooden spoon into the rice and noodles a few times, being careful not to hit the tahdig; this will allow steam to escape while cooking. Cover and cook until you see steam escaping from the sides of the lid and tahdig starts to set, about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine 1/4 cup boiling water with 2 tablespoons melted butter and remaining saffron water. Lay a kitchen towel out on a heatproof surface.\nTest the tahdig by quickly tapping the side of the pot with a wooden spoon. When the pot sizzles, remove it from the heat. Remove the lid and place it on the kitchen towel, being careful that none of the condensation drips into the pot. Wrap the towel around the lid and secure the ends at the top by the handle so they will not hang near the heat source. Drizzle the butter mixture over the rice and cover with the towel-wrapped lid.\nPlace a heat diffuser on a burner over low or medium-low heat and return the pot to the stove. Cook until crispy, rotating the pot a few times, about 35 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a damp kitchen towel; let sit, uncovered, for 5 minutes so tahdig will release easily.\nMeanwhile, melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add dates, raisins, and cinnamon; sprinkle with a little salt. Cook and stir until dates are glistening and soft, 3 to 5 minutes.\nGently scatter rice on a platter and remove potato tahdig pieces and serve on the side. Sprinkle raisin-date sauce over top.	10	3	https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/279194/reshteh-polo-persian-noodle-rice/	Reshteh Polo (Persian Noodle Rice)	35 mins	1 hrs 10 mins
